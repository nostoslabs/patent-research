    "abstract": "The present invention relates to systems and methods for manipulating the orientation of a plurality of bone fragments with respect to one another, and in particular it relates to external fixation devices in which rings thereof may be manipulated with respect to one another via bone transport assemblies. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION External fixation frames may be used to correct skeletal deformities using the distraction osteogenesis process. The Ilizarov external fixation devices, for example, are widely used for this purpose. The Ilizarov-type devices may be used to translate bone segments by manipulating rings connected to each bone segment. External fixation devices generally utilize a plurality of threaded rods fixated to through-holes in the rings to build the frame. In order to build a desired frame, these rods generally have to have different lengths. A problem that may arise out of this is that such external fixation frames generally do not allow significant manipulation of what may be referred to as a transport ring without disassembling and then reassembling the frame or adding new devices. These systems generally require removal of the entire frame in order to perform reconstruction. Once the frame is installed, the patient or surgeon generally moves the rings or percutaneous fixation components manually or mechanically by adjusting a series of adjustment mechanism, such as nuts, for example. A traditional method of adjusting the frame height generally requires the surgeon to loosen an individual nut gradually while tightening another other nut in order to secure the frame. These position adjustments must be done where the nuts are secured, making it very difficult for the patient to make the required daily adjustments with consideration of stable fixation in mind. Other devices use different techniques to adjust the effective length of the rods, but all must be adjusted somewhere between the ends, offering limited access for the patient. As adjustments made to external fixation devices are often a daily task for the patient, easy access to frame adjustment mechanisms would be beneficial for the patient. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A first aspect of the present invention is a bone transport frame including first and second rings, a plurality of elongate struts, and a plurality of ring transport assemblies. The first and second rings each have upper and lower ring surfaces and a central axis that is perpendicular to the upper and lower ring surfaces. The plurality of elongate struts each having a central axis and are coupled to the first and second rings, the plurality of elongate struts each include a first adjustable member. The plurality of ring transport assemblies are adapted to rotatably couple the second ring to the plurality of elongate struts, the plurality of ring transport assemblies each include a second adjustable member. Preferably, rotation of the first adjustable member transports the second ring in either a proximal or distal direction with respect to the first ring, and rotation of the second adjustable member translates the central axis of the second ring either toward or away from each central axis of the plurality of elongate struts. In accordance with one embodiment of this first aspect of the present invention, the bone transport frame includes a third ring having upper and lower ring surfaces and having a central axis that is perpendicular to the upper and lower ring surfaces. The third ring is also coupled to the plurality of elongate struts and is located distally to the second ring, the second ring being located distally to the first ring. In accordance with another embodiment of this first aspect, the first, second and third rings each include a plurality of through-holes that extend through the upper and lower ring surfaces. In accordance with yet another embodiment of this first aspect, the bone transport frame further includes a plurality of pin retention members and bone pins adapted to couple the first, second, and third rings to a first, second and third bone fragments, respectively. The plurality of pin retention members are operatively coupled to the plurality of through-holes of the first, second and third rings. In accordance with still yet another embodiment of this first aspect, the bone transport frame further includes a plurality of wire retention members and bone wires adapted to couple the first, second and third rings to the first, second and third bone fragments, respectively. The plurality of wire retention members are operatively coupled to the plurality of through-holes of the first, second, and third rings. In accordance with still yet another embodiment of this first aspect, the bone transport frame further includes a plurality of flange extension members adapted to couple the first ring to the plurality of elongate struts, wherein each of the plurality of flange extension members include a first through-hole adapted to receive a first coupling member for coupling a first end of the plurality of flange extension members to the first ring and a second through hole adapted to receive a proximal end portion of the plurality of elongate struts. Each of the plurality of flange extension members further comprises a third through-hole adapted to receive a second coupling member for rigidly coupling the first end of the plurality of flange extension members to the first ring. In accordance with still yet another embodiment of this first aspect, the first adjustable member of each of the plurality of elongate struts is located at the proximal end portion of the plurality of elongate struts. The first adjustable member of each of the plurality of elongate struts is adapted to make incremental adjustments, each incremental adjustment corresponding to a clinically optimal adjustment length. The first adjustable member of each of the plurality of elongate struts is adapted to record each incremental adjustment. In accordance with still yet another embodiment of this first aspect, the plurality of elongate struts further includes a threaded shaft and a position adjustment member coupled to each of the plurality of ring transport assemblies, each position adjustment member adapted to transport along a length of the threaded shaft in the proximal and distal directions. Each position adjustment member has a semi-locked position such that the location of each position adjustment member on the threaded shaft is constant when the threaded shaft is not being rotated in either clockwise or counterclockwise directions about the central axis of the plurality of elongate struts and has an unlocked position such that the location of each position adjustment member can transport in either the proximal or distal directions without the threaded shaft being rotated in either the clockwise or counterclockwise directions about the central axis of the plurality of elongate struts. In accordance with still yet another embodiment of this first aspect, each of the plurality of ring transport assemblies further comprises a third adjustment member and wherein releasing the third adjustment member allows the second ring to move such that the central axis of the second ring is oblique to the central axis of each of the plurality of elongate struts. In accordance with still yet another embodiment of this first aspect, the second adjustment member is coupled to the third adjustment member, the second adjustment member being adapted to incrementally translate the central axis of the second ring either toward or away from each central axis of the plurality of elongate struts. A second aspect of the present invention is a method for transporting a second bone segment with respect to a first bone segment utilizing a bone transport frame including a first ring, a second ring, a plurality of ring transport assemblies, a plurality of first and second adjustment mechanisms, and a plurality of elongate struts. The method includes coupling the first bone segment to the first ring; coupling the second bone segment to the second ring; actuating the first adjustment mechanism to transport the second ring in either a proximal or distal direction along a central axis of at least one of the plurality of elongate struts; and actuating the second adjustable member to translate the second ring either toward or away from each of the plurality of elongate struts. In accordance with one embodiment of this second aspect, the step of actuating the first adjustment mechanism comprises incrementally rotating the first adjustment mechanism such that the second ring transports a fixed length along the central axis of at least one of the plurality of elongate struts, each incremental rotation of the first adjustment mechanism corresponding to a first fixed length. The step of actuating the second adjustable member comprises incrementally rotating the second adjustment mechanism such that the second ring translates either toward or away from each of the plurality of elongate struts, each incremental rotation of the second adjustment mechanism corresponding to a second fixed length.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a flaky, fine powder which is used as a mixing or compounding agent for cosmetics, pigments and paints, or as a filler for use with such materials as plastics, and production thereof. Furthermore, the present invention relates to cosmetics in which the aforesaid flaky, fine powder is mixed or compounded. 2. Description of Related Art A flaky, fine powder has been used as a compounding agent for such materials as cosmetics, pigments and paints, or as a filler for such materials as plastics, and this type of flaky, fine powder, produced by covering the surface of a flaky substance such as mica as a base with metal oxide or other appropriate material is well known. This type of flaky, fine powder is produced by precipitating hydroxide from aqueous solution of metallic salt under coexistence with a flaky substance as a base and depositing said hydroxide on the surface of the flaky substance. However, a covering layer formed on the surface of the aforesaid flaky substance is a layer comprising primary particles and/or aggregated particles of the hydroxide and having an uneven thickness. For this reason, it is extremely difficult to control the form or thickness of the covered particles. In addition, a main purpose of reduction of the conventional type of flaky, fine powder covered with oxides was to make use of the physical characteristics specific to the oxides used for covering the surface (such as a refractive index or a light transmittance), but a flaky, fine powder for use of its function originating from the shape of the covered particles has not been known. In the German Patent Laid Open Publication No. 3922178 which was laid open on Jan. 17, 1991 after the priority date (Aug. 16, 1990) of the present PCT application, a minute flaky base which does not aggregate but has a high dispersibility, characterized in that said base contains spherical particles, each having a smaller diameter as compared to that of the minute flaky base, by at least 0.5% by weight, is disclosed. It is described in this publication that the minute flaky base having a diameter in a maximum range from 1 to 500 μm is suited, and that a diameter of the spherical particle should preferably be in the range from 0.05 to 50 μm. It seems that the base can be easily moved because spherical particles act as a kind of ball bearing on the surface of the minute flaky substance. Furthermore, in the aforesaid publication, the method of mixing a suspension of minute flaky base with a suspension of spherical particles, each having a smaller diameter as compared to that of the base, then filtering, drying, and calcining, if necessary, the base, is disclosed as the method of producing the aforesaid minute flaky base which does not aggregate and has a high dispersibility. Also, it is described in the publication that, when preparing the mixture described above, it is important to fully mix the two suspensions by means of ultrasonic processing. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Objects of the present invention include, by covering a surface of a flaky substance as a base with non-porous spherical particles to provide a means for reducing the glossiness of the base caused by the irregular reflection of light on its surface and improving the slipperiness of the base and to thus provide a new, and at the same time, useful, flaky, fine powder as well as a method for production thereof. The flaky, fine powder according to the present invention comprises a flaky substance and silica particles deposited on its surface, or comprises the flaky substance and the silica particles further immobilized by hydrolysate of alkoxysilane or silica gel. The flaky, fine powder according to one embodiment of the present invention is produced by adding alkoxysilane in a dispersion containing a flaky substance and silica particles and then hydrolyzing the alkoxysilane, or by adding silicic acid solution in the dispersion described above and gelling the silicic acid solution. Furthermore, the production of the flaky, fine powder according to the present invention comprising depositing silica particles on a base in a dispersion, or immobilizing by hydrolysate of alkoxysilane and/or silica gel, is very simple and economical, and the non-porous spherical silica particles are tightly carried on the surface of the flaky substance, so that the flaky, fine powder is physically very stable and is available for various applications, as described above.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to both a method and related apparatus for treating vascular defects such as aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) in a patient&#39;s vasculature. More particularly the invention is directed to a system well suited for treating vascular defects in vessels in the head and neck of a patient. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Aneurysms are circumscribed dilations connecting directly with the lumen of a blood vessel. Aneurysms may result from acquired or congenital diseases which create a weakness in the blood vessel wall. It should be appreciated that aneurysms have a relatively turbulent flow of blood through the “neck” of the aneurysm. AVMs are inappropriately interconnected vessels that shunt blood from the arterial circulation to the venous flow. AVM defects are usually congenital. Depending on vessel size and the nature of the interconnections that make up the malformation, AVMs can also be accompanied by substantial blood flow. In both of these types of vascular defect the presence of blood flow complicates treatment. Typically aneurysms have thin walls which are vulnerable to a sudden rupture. If an aneurysm ruptures, the resulting hemorrhage can cause death. A hemorrhage can also cause both excessive pressure on nearby tissues and a reduction of blood flow to the tissues “downstream” of the aneurysm. Neurosurgeons have perfected certain conventional treatments for embolizing aneurysms in small vessels of the brain. The embolization process causes the aneurysm to heal in a way that removes the “pocket” from the wall of the vessel. In the most mature technique, the neurosurgeon accesses the region of the aneurysm under direct visualization through a craniotomy and places one or more aneurysm clips on the “neck” or opening of the aneurysm. This conventional open surgical approach has a high rate of success, but is highly invasive and undesirable for that reason. The risk associated with conventional approaches has encouraged the development of minimally invasive intravascular treatment approaches. Currently, the most widely used minimally invasive technique, involves placement of small coils of wire into the aneurysm. The coils are delivered transluminaly through a catheter that is navigated to the aneurysm site. Once the catheter is advanced into the neck of the aneurysm, multiple coils are released into the aneurysm. The coils dramatically reduce the blood flow through the aneurysm, which results in clotting within the aneurysm. The GDC coiling procedure can be time-consuming due to the number of coils that need to be inserted and released to fill or “pack” the aneurysm. The coiling procedures often need to be repeated because it is difficult to completely ‘pack” the aneurysm with coils. In this procedure the “neck” of the aneurysm helps to retain the coils. Consequently there are a substantial number of aneurysms which cannot be treated using coils because the large neck allows the first coil to escape from the aneurysm. This common problem is seen radiographically as the first coil curving out of the aneurysm and entering the associated vessel branch. Retrieving an repositioning coils is both difficult and time consuming. In additions to “coils”, liquid or semi-liquid occlusive embolic materials have been proposed for use in treating aneurysms. These fluids include iron-acrylic compounds, as well as, a large collection of biocompatible glues and polymers. Attempts have been made to inject the occlusive materials directly into aneurysms to fill the cavity of the aneurysm. Typically this procedure uses a needle to pierce the wall of the aneurysm to place the material. There has been limited success using these fluids due to the tendency of the blood flow to pass the embolic material out of the aneurysm. This “wash out” situation presents serious complications due to the high probably of occluding the distal branches of the cerebral vasculature. Some investigators have attempted to treat aneurysms with liquids that denature proteins such as alcohol and the like. These procedures are risky as well due to the fact that the treatment occurs in a vessel with active blood flow and the denaturing process can occur in healthy tissue by accident. The literature has reported several studies where magnetic particles are combined with other materials to serve as an embolic material. The studies have reported improved success in treating aneurysms. In one representative study, a needle surrounded by a magnet was inserted through a burr hole in the patient&#39;s head. A stereotactic frame attached to the patient&#39;s head was used to direct the needle to the dome of the aneurysm. The mixture of magnetic particles and occlusive agent was injected through the needle, across the wall of the vessel. The study revealed several defects or shortcomings including the need for a burr hole in the skull and a prolonged embolization time for the occlusive agent. Complications also resulted from rupturing the aneurysm. In the reported study the magnet remained in place in the patient&#39;s head for several days to completely embolize the aneurysm. The reported technique was unable to hold a magnetic mixture in aneurysms greater than about 1-cm in diameter. AVMs may also be treated with embolic materials. The most frequently reported technique involves the use of very small polyvinyl alcohol particles, which are sized to occlude the smallest fistulas in the AVM. This technique involves “guess work” to prepare the right size particles that will not pass through the AVM. Also, there is limited control of the emboli, since the catheter placement and the direction of greatest blood flow dictate the delivery of the embolic particles. Visualization of the particles is problematic as well. For these reasons it is desirable to improve treatment techniques for vascular defects such as aneurysms and AVMs.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to appliances for use with stomas. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION An ileostomy is a surgical procedure in which the small intestines are surgically rerouted to the outside of the body. People require an ileostomy when the large intestines or rectum are affected by injury of disease to the point where they can no longer function and must be removed. Conditions which require removal of the large intestine or rectum include ulcerative colitis, polyposis, and tumors. When a surgeon removes the large intestine or rectum from a patient, the surgeon must also make a new passageway for removal of waste from the body. The surgeon does this by connecting the end of the small intestine (or a portion of the large intestine) to the outside of the body, and creating an opening in the skin. The opening in the skin is call a stoma, and is usually located on the right side of the abdomen near the waist. Related surgical procedures include the colostomy, in which colon is surgically rerouted to a stoma on the body, and the urostomy, in which the urinary tract is rerouted to a stoma on the body. Each of these ostomy procedures requires similar post-operative hygiene and appliances. After ileostomy surgery, patients are relieved from the painful conditions requiring the ileostomy. However, the patients must use special appliances and use special care to remove waste material from the body through the ileostomy and stoma. Patients must wear a pouch over the stoma to collect waste material. The pouch is connected to the stoma with a fluid connector and a barrier seal around the stoma. The barrier seal may be is glued to the body around the stoma with special adhesive. The barrier seal is absorbent so that is absorbs any leakage that might occur through the fluid connector. The appliance may be disposable, in which case the pouch, fluid connector, and barrier seal are replaced as necessary. The appliance may be reusable, in which case the pouch must be emptied often, the fluid connector must be cleaned and reinstalled, and the barrier seal must be cleaned or replaced. The barrier seal must be replaced every two or three days. With proper vigilance to the hygiene requirements of the appliances, irritation of the stoma and skin around the stoma can be limited and odor associated with leakage can be avoided. With these special appliances, patients can engage in a very normal lifestyle, except for the time necessary to maintain the appliances and care for the stoma and experience of discomfort attendant to typical shortcomings of available appliances. The hygienic regimen is, however, burdensome and imperfect in avoiding irritation. Any device or method that lessens the burden on the patient and reduces the irritation of the stoma and surrounding skin will be useful for all ileostomy patients. The stoma is a generally circular or annular opening in the abdomen. It is formed by piercing the skin to form a hole, pulling the ileum (the end of the small intestine) through the hole in the skin, and everting a short segment of the small intestine (turn it inside out), and suturing the everted segment to the skin. The sutures create a circle of stitches around the stoma. The stoma protrudes slightly from the surface of the skin, and the suture circle is slightly elevated. The typical ileostomy pouch has a stoma opening which is aligned with the stoma, so that effluent flows from the small intestine through the stoma and stoma opening into the pouch. The pouch is held on the body, and stoma opening held in place over the stoma, with a faceplate that is taped to the body. The faceplate has a stoma opening which is ringed by a flanged fluid connector which connects to the stoma opening of the pouch. The stoma opening is the same size or slightly larger than the stoma, and may include a flexible silicone gasket with an opening the same size as the stoma. The faceplate is taped to the body with an adhesive disk call a barrier seal. The barrier seal is adhesive on both sides, and tapes the faceplate to the body. (The faceplate may also be glued to the body. Many patients also apply microporous tape around the faceplate before attaching the pouch to the faceplate, and some manufacturers supply the faceplate with a picture frame of tape.) The barrier seal is also absorbent, so that it absorbs any effluent that leaks from the stoma connection to the pouch. The pouch is fitted over the flange of the faceplate, and locked in place with a snap fit closure (like an aspirin bottle cap). This system is sometimes referred to as a two piece system, and may be described in various ways. For example, ConvaTec refers to the faceplate/barrier seal assembly as a skin barrier with a flange. The barrier seal is sometimes referred to as a skin seal, barrier ring seal, or wafer or disc. In contrast to the two-piece system, a one piece system integrates the before mentioned components into one disposable unit who&#39;s overall function is similar to the two piece system. In another type of pouch, the stoma opening on the pouch has a tacky silicone ring which fits directly around the stoma, and the adhesive barrier seal connects the pouch directly to the skin around the stoma. Non-adhesive pouches use a similar setup, with an O-ring seal fitting around the stoma and the stoma opening of the pouch fitting directly over the O-ring, and the entire assembly is held on the body with a belt. The integrity of the entire appliance depends on the effectiveness of the skin barrier seal. The barrier seal is intended to absorb effluent and keep it from contacting the skin around the stoma (referred to as the peristomal skin). When it fails in protecting the skin, the peristomal skin becomes irritated or infected. The skin barrier will not adhere to irritated or infected skin, and will not work to protect the skin. Thus any outbreak of peristomal skin irritation or infection can be very difficult to cure.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to methods and apparatus for using arterial blood pressure to dilate the lumen rather than expanding/cutting mechanical means so as to preserve the sensitive endothelial lining of the artery. More specifically, the present invention relates to production of a temperature profile within the arterial wall that corresponds to the atherosclerotic lesion size, shape, and position so as to necrose (ablate) connective tissue and soften plaque to thereby impart increased flexibility to the arterial wall. 2. Description of Prior Art Atheroscleroses, also known as hardening of the arteries, is one of the most common types of heart disease. Each year several hundred thousand people die of this disease or of complications relating thereto. By the age of forty, many people have already developed atherosclerotic lesions although no symptoms may appear. Atherosclerosis is a progressive disease wherein fatty, fibrous, calcific, or thrombotic deposits produce atheromatous plaques within the arterial walls as indicated generally in FIG.  11 . Moreover, atherosclerosis tends to involve large and medium sized arteries such as the aorta, iliac, femoral, cerebral, as well as the coronary artery. The atherosclerotic lesions are substantially comprised of plaque and scar tissue. The plaque is typically encapsulated within living connective tissue. Plaque is a heterogenous material, sometimes non-living, that may include calcified, wax-like, fibrotic, fatty, and brittle components. As the lesions within the arterial walls grow in size, the lumen or passageway through the coronary artery may be correspondingly reduced in effective cross-sectional diameter (stenosis). The constricted (stenotic) lumen may then restrict the nutrient blood flow to muscles of the heart. Therefore, atheroscleroses is often a major contributing factor in both acute and chronic heart problems. Also, when the lumen is sufficiently narrowed, the rate of blood flow may be so diminished that an affixed blood clot (thrombus) or circulating blood clot (embolus) may spontaneously occur. Thus, the presence of atherosclerotic plaque not only reduces blood flow to the heart muscle but also is a major predisposing factor in coronary thrombosis. While pharmacological treatment is often used to treat atherosclerosis, such treatment is sometimes considered to be insufficiently effective for increasing blood flow. Therefore, techniques such as balloon angioplasty (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty) have been developed to mechanically increase the luminal opening. However, mechanical techniques tend to traumatize the artery and often result in restenosis (reclosing of the lumen). Standard balloon angioplasty produces a gross trauma that severely injures the endothelium or lining of the artery. The endothelium is a very fragile layer of cells that performs the very important function of limiting thrombotic processes (See FIG.  12 ). Unlike other surfaces and materials, when blood cells come in contact with the endothelium there is no tendency to form a clot. The layer of endothelial cells normally covers the internal surface of all vessels, rendering the vessel surface compatible. i.e., non-thrombogenic and non-reactive with blood. If the endothelium is damaged, platelet deposition becomes a problem. Once this layer is injured, it does not normally grow back uniformly and so damage thereof tends to permanently induce thrombotic processes. Injury to the endothelium has been associated with accelerating of atherosclerotic processes and/or restenosis. At least one patent discussed hereinafter teaches to alleviate, at least to some extent, damage caused to the endothelium by providing a bioprotective layer around the angioplasty balloon to cushion, coat, and insert anti-inflammatory agents prior to opening the balloon. Another patent discussed hereinafter teaches reducing trauma damage to the endothelium by reducing angioplasty balloon pressure using heat and feedback control. However, due to the mechanical forces in balloon angioplasty, damage to the fragile endothelium may still occur. The bioprotective coatings may, according to the patent teachings, also reduce problems created by angioplasty-induced tissue tears or cleavages that can result in blood accumulation along the cleavage planes of arterial wall layers. The thickening caused during such problems may acutely block or occlude the arterial lumen and require emergency interventions such as stents or open heart surgery. The trauma to the endothelium and to arterial walls from balloon angioplasty often evoke a potent inflammatory response, or restenosis (reclosing of the artery), whereby scar tissue growth and other processes occur to once again reduce the arterial lumen opening. As discussed in some detail below with respect to numerous different techniques, restenosis is probably one of the most significant problems that occurs with existing techniques for dilating or opening the arteries. Restenosis may occur due to numerous processes including the following: clots that grow gradually or contain growth hormones released by, plateletes within the clot, clots formed due to exposure to collagen (connective tissue) which is highly thrombogenic, growth hormones released by other cells that cause smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts in the region to multiply, tears in the artery wall that expose blood to foreign material and proteins thereby producing clots, white cells that migrate to the area and lay down scar tissue, growth of new tissue due to any kind of inflammatory response, and/or other factors that may cause the artery lumen to reclose. Several different processes may operate simultaneously to cause restenosis. After balloon angioplasty procedures, narrowing of the artery by 50% may occur in more than one-half of the patients and about one quarter of the patients may require a repeat procedure by the end of one year. As mentioned above, restenosis (reclosing of the artery) remains a major problem in treatment of atherosclerosis by balloon angioplasty. While significant efforts have been made to dampen the reactive proliferation with a variety of pharmacological and genetic interventions, these interventions have thus far found limited or no successful clinical application. Another problem with balloon angioplasty relates to the fact that the lesions, or atheromas, within arterial cross-sections are typically asymmetrically distributed. That is to say the lesions often occur on one side, portion, or sector of the artery while an opposite or adjacent sector of the artery is relatively free of the disease. It was initially postulated that the increase in endovascular pressure created with a balloon would somehow selectively crush lesions. However, given that the thick-walled sectors containing atheromas are typically abundant with dense collagen or connective tissue, the lesions may actually be less likely to undergo deformation than the opposite relatively thin-walled, lesion-free sectors. Thus, the maximum trauma produced by balloon angioplasty may well occur in the healthy sector of the artery. Some of the patents discussed hereinafter attempt to reduce, at least to some extent, this problem and related problems by first heating the artery to soften the plaque. However, unless the heating is applied selectively to the atheromas heat damage may occur to the artery and endothelium. As well, mechanical trauma may still occur to the endothelium and/or other arterial components. Acute closure of the lumen after balloon angioplasty remains the most common cause of failed angioplasty and occurs in approximately 5% of the patients. This complication may be associated with varying degrees of mortality that may exceed 50% when emergency coronary bypass surgery has to be performed. For the above reasons, balloon angioplasty is often problematic due to restenosis or, less frequently, abrupt closure. Therefore, other catheter techniques for the mechanical widening of the lumen of diseased coronary arteries have been devised, including various tissue cutting techniques. Directional coronary atherectomy (DCA) involves the selective excision and retrieval of atheromatous or proliferative tissue obstructing the arterial lumen. In this procedure, the end of the catheter is provided with a fenestrated metal cylinder within which a piston-like cutter is moved via a torque cable. The cut tissue is recovered in a distal portion of the catheter. As compared with balloon angioplasty, the initial luminal widening achieved by DCA is similar or perhaps slightly better. Again, restenosis is problematical and, as before, the restenosis is probably acerbated by damage to the endothelium. Rotational atherectomy incorporates a rotary file or burr (brass ellipsoid of varying diameter covered with diamond chips—rotablator) into the distal portion of the catheter. The rotary file or burr is connected to a motor-operated drive shaft. Abrasion of the narrowed artery segments produces micro particles that are allowed to escape into the distal circulation for capillary entrapment. The rotablator has been used for treating heavily calcified lesions, lesions at branch points (‘ostial disease’), and lesions involving long arterial segments (‘diffuse disease’). Restenosis frequently occurs. However, because this instrument is often used to treat refractory or difficult-to-treat lesions, the results of the treatment are difficult to compare with those of balloon angioplasty. Transluminal extraction catheter atherectomy (TEC) involves use of a catheter with tip-mounted cutting blades. The tissue fragments are recovered by aspirating a flush solution during cutting. As with the other mechanical devices discussed above, restenoses are frequent. In summary, the exact role of atherectomy or mechanical tissue cutting devices is not yet completely defined for treatment of atherosclerosis, but it is fair to say that such devices do not overcome the major complication of balloon angioplasty, i.e.. restenosis, Eximer (UV) laser coronary angioplasty systems are the only laser devices currently approved by the FDA for treatment of atherosclerosis. These devices act to remove tissue at the lesion from the artery. Light in the UV range can remove tissue by triggering photochemical reactions (photoablation). However, there is also considerable evidence that UV lasers remove tissue by a thermal mechanism like that of longer wavelengths (vaporization) such as visible, infrared, millimeter wave, and microwave spectra. One characteristic of eximer radiation (308 nm) is that the energy deposition is quite superficial. Accordingly, the procedure destroys the superficial cell layer (endothelial cells) and consequently produces a strong inflammatory response as does balloon angioplasty. Not unexpectedly, and in contrast to early claims, UV laser angioplasty does not have a lower restenosis rate than balloon angioplasty. This fact also suggests that tissue deformation, as occurs in balloon and rotablator procedures, is not the major determinant of restenosis because lasers do not forcefully distend artery walls. Acute coronary closure after balloon angioplasty may be treated in several ways including perfusion balloon angioplasty (prolonged balloon inflation with protective distal coronary perfusion), atherectomy catheters as discussed above, and intracoronary stents. Coronary stents are designed to scaffold artery walls. The use of stents for acute closure is associated with a high initial success rate in maintaining arterial patency. However, stent therapy suffers from several drawbacks including subacute stent thrombosis, bleeding due to the necessarily aggressive anticoagulation treatment, and restenosis that occurs in 30% to 50% of the cases. The use of stents in non-emergency situations is an experimental procedure. Another procedures for treating atherosclerosis is coronary artery bypass surgery. However, this procedure does not clearly suggest a better prognosis than balloon angioplasty and has the disadvantage of being a major surgical procedure. Catheters with 1.2 or 1.7 mm ball tips for ultrasound (195 kHz) destruction of atheromatous lesions in artery walls have been reported. Experimental use of microwave balloon angioplasty with a gap antenna operating at 2.45 GHz has been reported and the authors concluded that balloon angioplasty combined with microwave heating yielded wider luminal diameters four weeks after intervention. Other uses of heating in combination with balloon angioplasty are discussed in the following patents.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to an enclosed paperboard carton capable of enclosing containers, which carton has a unique opening and dispensing feature that allows the containers, for example, cans or bottles, to be removed or dispensed without destroying the overall structural integrity of the carton. The dispensing feature may also provide a safety net for the first container that is automatically dispensed when the carton is opened. This dispensing feature also permits the carton to be carried from one location to another after the dispenser has been opened without the containers falling out of the carton. Fully enclosed carton capable of enclosing cans have been used in the past that have a feature for dispensing the cans one at a time. Dispenser sections have been provided at various locations within these cartons depending on the design. Many of these dispensers suffer from the disadvantage that once open, they allow all of the containers to roll out. In addition, it is difficult to carry one of these cartons without the containers falling out once the dispenser has been opened. Most of these dispensers have been designed for dispensing cans or bottles which have cylindrical tops and bottoms of substantially the same size and configuration. These dispensers are not suitable for dispensing bottles that have a neck of smaller diameter than the body of the bottle. In effect, many of these dispensers destroy the overall carton integrity once they have been opened. Many of these dispensing features do not have any means for preventing the first container that is automatically dispensed from falling free from the carton. In other words, its dispensing feature has no safety net. U.S. Pat. No. 3,265,283 to Farquhar discloses a fully enclosed carton having a dispenser for dispensing the enclosed cans. The end wall of the carton has a dispensing flap which can be folded down upon opening. An aperture formed by the flap extends into the side walls to permit grasping of the can to withdraw it from the carton. When the flap is opened, the cans are held in the carton by an accurate flap portion extending downwardly in the end wall into the center of the aperture. The structural integrity of this carton is compromised because the entire bottom end of the carton is opened. The dispensing flap does not provide a safety net to prevent a can from rolling out of the carton and falling to the floor. This carton cannot be easily moved from one location to another after the dispenser has been opened without the containers falling out. It will be realized that the design of this carton is not satisfactory for dispensing bottles with necks as the exiting container being dispensed needs to have a corresponding cylindrical top and bottom of approximately the same size to facilitate easy dispensing by a person grasping the ends of the exiting container. U.S. Pat. No. 4,364,509 to Holley, Jr. et al. also discloses a fully enclosed carton with a dispenser in one of the end walls. This dispenser is likewise formed in the end wall by tearing out an end flap and lowering it into proper position. Expansion slits are provided in the side wall for the user&#39;s fingers to grasp the ends of the exiting can. This carton is not adapted for use with bottles, because of the necessity of grasping the ends of the container for removal. In addition, it is not adapted for carrying cans once the carton has been opened as they are likely to roll out of the dispenser. There is also no safety net to receive the cans as they are rolled out of the dispenser. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of this invention to provide a dispenser that preserves the integrity of the carton after the dispenser has been opened. It is a further object to provide a dispenser that can be used with both cans and bottles. It is another object of this invention to provide a safety net or basket for the containers that are automatically dispensed when the dispenser is opened. It is a still further object of this invention is to develop a dispenser that will permit the carton to be moved from one location to another after it has been opened without discharging containers. The final object of this invention is to provide a dispenser that can be easily opened. Briefly described, in a preferred form, the objects of this invention are achieved by providing an enclosed carton that has a unique dispenser in the exiting end of the carton. This carton is generally rectangular and has a bottom, a top, two sides, a closed end and an exiting end. The carton is foldably constructed from a blank having panels and flaps. The exiting end or ends of the carton permits containers to be taken from the carton via the dispenser. This carton has a dispenser that is torn from an end of the carton by tearing an end portion of the top panel, a triangular portion from the adjoining side panels, and all of the side end flaps except the bottom most portions, to form a dispenser. The top end flap is removed when this dispenser is opened. This dispenser may have a semi-circular score line attached to the dispenser score line in the top panel for easy opening of the dispenser. A person&#39;s fingers can be inserted between this semi-circular score line and the dispenser to commence the opening of the dispenser. This semi-circular score line is placed so that when it is pushed open, a person&#39;s fingers will go between the first and second containers inside of the carton. A score line can be provided that bisects the semi-circular score line parallel to the longitudinal axis of the containers to permit ease of entry of a person&#39;s fingers. The bottom portions of the side end flaps are left intact to preserve the structural integrity of the carton and also to provide a wall to prevent an end container in the bottom of the carton from accidentally rolling out. It should be realized that the dispenser does not have to be totally removed from the carton, as the score lines in the side and top panels can be broken and the dispenser flipped over along the score lines in the side end flaps to form a safety net or basket when the first container in the top of the carton rolls out of the dispenser. If the score line in the side end flaps is not broken, the dispenser can be reclosed. This carton can be constructed by gluing, taping, stapling and the like, or by locking. The dispenser of this invention can be put in one end of the carton or in both ends. A dispenser can be torn from the carton and placed under the other end of the carton to elevate it to facilitate the removal of the containers from the carton. These and other objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent upon reading the following specification in conjunction with the accompanying drawing figures.",

    "abstract": "This disclosure relates to the field of dressing protection for patients fitted with a central venous access device (CVAD). More particularly this disclosure relates to a removable, adjustable, protective device which allows viewing and access to the dressing and shields and compartmentalizes CVAD peripherals without removal from the patient. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Disclosed is a device which simultaneously provides the advantages of comfort and flexibility while also providing a highly secure position for tubing and lumens extending from a percutaneous site. In one embodiment, the device is provided for use with patients fitted with central venous access devices (CVAD), gastronomy tubes, or chest tubes. CVADs allow frequent access to the veins without deep needle sticks. Examples of CVADs include central venous catheters (CVC) or central lines, surgically implanted ports, and peripherally inserted central catheters (PICC). A central venous catheter (CVC) is surgically implanted into a large vein in the neck, chest or groin. A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) is inserted into one of the peripheral veins in the upper amt. In addition to the tube inserted into the vein, CVCs and PICCs include lumens. The tube extending from the percutaneous site is often supplied with a central hub or manifold for connection to one or multiple lumens. The lumens, which may or may not be connected to an infusion pump, are used to administer medication or fluids, obtain blood tests, and directly obtain cardiovascular measurements such as the central venous pressure. Venous access devices typically remain in place for extended periods of time. The percutaneous site is dressed and requires routine observation and attention by medical personnel. Typically, while the lumens are not in use they are secured by adhesive tape to the patient to prevent any accidental contact, unwanted movement, and inadvertent removal. The repeated removal of the tape often causes irritation. When CVADs are used with babies and small children, there is an increased risk that the intravenous tubes and the lumens can be dislodged and contaminated, thus increasing the possibility of bloodstream infections. The disclosed device provides a comfortable fit, is adjustable, allows access to the dressing, redirects and protects the intravenous tubes, and secures the lumens from inadvertent tampering without the use of tape or irritating adhesives. U.S. Pat. No. 4,470,410 to Elliott discloses a protective retaining device for application to the site of an intravenous or catheter intervention system to protect the site and to retain the tubing in a position proximate the body. The device is comprised of an elongated flexible sleeve. An opening is provided over the intervention site.

    "abstract": "The invention features methods of reducing the amount of constituents in tobacco, as well as the tobacco obtained by such methods. More specifically, such methods are performed on the tobacco itself rather than on aqueous tobacco extracts. These methods are capable of reducing constituents without significant reduction in tobacco attributes. For example, the methods of the invention may be used to reduce secondary alkaloids selectively compared to primary alkaloids. Accordingly, the invention features a method of reducing an amount of a constituent, e.g., a secondary alkaloid or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), in tobacco by providing a vessel containing tobacco comprising the constituent; contacting the tobacco with a subcritical fluid; and removing the subcritical fluid from the vessel, e.g., by venting to the atmosphere or a second vessel. Preferably, the methods of the invention selectively reduce the amount of the constituent relative to a primary alkaloid. In another aspect, the invention features a method of reducing the amount of a constituent in tobacco by providing a plurality of valved vessels connected to form a system, wherein the plurality of vessels contains tobacco comprising the constituent; contacting tobacco in a first vessel with a subcritical fluid; removing the subcritical fluid from the first vessel; and directing subcritical fluid, e.g., that from the first vessel, to a second vessel, to additional vessels, or to a waste vessel (or vented to atmosphere) as desired. The method may further include the steps of isolating the first vessel (or any other) from the system; and removing the tobacco from the first vessel, wherein the tobacco has a reduced amount of the constituent. This further step may occur before, during, or after the subcritical fluid has been removed from the first vessel. In various embodiments of the above aspects of the invention, the method may include the step of separating a constituent from the subcritical fluid. This separation from the subcritical fluid may include the step of flowing the subcritical fluid containing the constituent into a second vessel that may or may not contain a substance capable of extracting a given constituent from the subcritical fluid. Exemplary substances include solid citric acid, an aqueous solution of citric acid, activated carbon, and solid magnesium silicate. Upon exiting a vessel or entering a second vessel (e.g., a separator vessel), the pressure or temperature of the subcritical fluid may be changed. In certain embodiments, a decrease in pressure causes a precipitation of the dissolved constituents. In other embodiments, the method further includes recirculating the subcritical fluid, after separation of the constituent, to a vessel containing tobacco. During recirculation, any flavor or aroma compounds removed from the tobacco with a constituent may be re-deposited in the tobacco. A variety of subcritical fluids, as disclosed herein, may be employed in the methods of the invention. The temperature and pressures employed for each subcritical fluid (or mixture thereof) may vary depending on the subcritical fluids employed. The subcritical fluid may be in liquid form, e.g., a compressed gas, or in gas form. In various embodiments, the methods reduce the amount of a constituent, e.g., secondary alkaloids or PAHs, in the tobacco by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 85%, or 95%. In yet another embodiment, the methods selectively reduce the amount of a constituent, e.g., secondary alkaloids or PAHs, in the tobacco by at least 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 75%, 85%, or 95%. The methods preferably retain at least 30%, 40%, 50%, 75%, 85%, 95%, or 99% of a primary alkaloid or a particular attribute, such as flavor or aroma compounds. The tobacco employed typically has a moisture content of between 5-60%, e.g., at least 10%, 15%, 20%, 30%, 40%, or 50%. The pH of the tobacco is typically between 4 and 9, e.g., at least pH 5, 6, 7, or 8. The invention further features tobacco or a tobacco product treated by the above-described methods. By a “chlorofluorocarbon” is meant a compound including only carbon, fluorine, and chlorine atoms. By a “chlorofluorohydrocarbon” is meant a compound including only carbon, hydrogen, fluorine, and chlorine atoms. By “constituent” is meant secondary alkaloids and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) found in tobacco. By “PAHs” is meant anthracene, anthanthrene, benzo(a)pyrene, coronene, fluoranthene, fluorene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene, and perylene. By “secondary alkaloid” is meant N-nitrosodimethylamine, N-nitrosodiethylamine, N-nitrosopyrrolidine, N-nitrosodiethanolamine, N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN), 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), N-nitrosoanatabine (NAT), or N-nitrosoanabasine (NAB).

It is another object of this invention to design the above lifting and stabilizing mechanism such that it can be operated at extremely high speed while maintaining both accurate vertical linear registration and a precise incremental control over the rate of vertical movement in the upward and downward directions. It is an additional object of this invention to design the above lifting and stabilizing mechanism such that it is smaller and lighter weight than conventional assemblies, thereby consuming less energy in operation, and permitting a wider range of operating environments and configurations. It is a related object of this invention to minimize and integrate the operational functions of the above lifting and stabilizing mechanism to require fewer regulating mechanisms, controls, and drive mechanisms. It is yet another object of this invention to design the above lifting and stabilizing mechanism to minimize wear on components, and to provide a system wherein worn components can be easily detected and replaced without disassembling the apparatus or removing the apparatus from the associated automated filling machine. Briefly described, the lifting and stabilizing mechanism of this invention incorporates a stationary frame and a generally horizontal carriage mounted for vertical movement relative to the frame. The carriage is carried on a plurality of geared belts which each criss-cross the frame in an opposing &#34;Z&#34; configuration, and are alternately wrapped over and under opposed drive wheels and tensioning wheels mounted on the carriage. The opposing belts maintain the carriage in its horizontal orientation, and the drive wheels are rotated to provide the lift force for controllably raising and lowering the carriage. The drive belts are attached to the frame using one of various clamping assemblies, and the vertical alignment of the carriage is augmented by a pin and channel guide assembly. Exact vertical linear registration o displacement of the carriage frame is accomplished by monitoring the revolutions of the drive wheels, drive axle, or drive motor, and comparing those revolutions to a predetermined chart or formula relating revolutions to linear displacement. One example of this lifting and stabilizing mechanism permits vertically registered movement of a five hundred pound carriage and bag hanging assembly over a five foot lift path in less than three quarters of a second.",

    "abstract": "We have found that, by careful control of the temperature of the barrel wall and of the screw, we can ensure that the chocolate or other fat-containing confectionery material of the present invention remains in a substantially solid or semi-solid state with a suitable degree of slippage against the screw enabling an efficient extrusion through the barrel. According to the present invention, there is provided a process for the continuous extrusion of chocolate or a fat-containing confectionery material using a screw extruder which comprises feeding the chocolate or fat-containing confectionery material into the screw extruder and generating a pressure to force the chocolate or fat-containing confectionery material in a substantially solid or semi-solid nonpourable form upstream of a flow constriction whereby the temperature of the screw, the temperature of the-barrel wall, the screw speed, pressure, contraction ratio and extrusion rate are such that the chocolate or fat-containing confectionery material is extruded in a substantially solid or semi-solid nonpourable form to produce an axially homogeneous extruded product, i.e., an extrudate, having a cross section that is of substantially the same profile as the die exit of the extruder, which is capable of retaining its shape and which has a temporary flexibility, or plasticity, enabling it to be physically manipulated, cut or plastically deformed before losing its flexibility or plasticity. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In carrying out the process of the present invention, a chocolate material employed may be dark, milk or white chocolate. Fat containing confectionery materials may include sugar, milk derived components, and fat and solids from vegetable or cocoa sources in differing proportions having a moisture content less than 10%, more usually less than 5% by weight. They may be chocolate substitutes containing direct cocoa butter replacements, stearines, coconut oil, palm oil, butter or any mixture thereof; nut pastes such as peanut butter and fat; praline; confectioner&#39;s coatings used for covering cakes usually comprising chocolate analogues with cocoa butter replaced by a cheaper non-tempering fat; or CARAMAC sold by Nestle comprising non-cocoa butter fats, sugar and milk. The temperature of the screw may be controlled, for instance, by a fluid such as water at the appropriate temperature flowing through the interior of the screw. For example, the fluid may enter at the upstream end and flow to the downstream end through one or more longitudinal channels and return through one or more longitudinal channels to the upstream end where it exits. The temperature of the barrel wall may be controlled, for instance, by a fluid such as water or glycol or a mixture thereof at the appropriate temperature flowing through a jacket surrounding the barrel wall. The temperatures of the screw and the barrel wall may be controlled according to the type of fats present in the material being extruded. For example, fats having higher melting points usually require a warmer barrel wall and screw than fats having lower melting points. The degree of flexibility of the extruded product may be affected by the temperature and the melting point of the fats present in the material being extruded. With regard to the screw temperature, if the temperature is too low, the chocolate will adhere to the screw and will not advance along the screw, whereas if the temperature is too high, the chocolate melts causing blockages. Depending on the type of fats present in the material being extruded, the temperature of the screw may be from 10° to 35° C., and more usually from 15° to 30° C. With regard to the barrel wail temperature, if the temperature of the barrel wall is too high, the chocolate may melt and slip against the wall and may not extrude efficiently. Depending on the type of fats present in the material being extruded, the temperature of the barrel wall may be from -50° to +20° C., more usually from -25° to +15° C. Often, the temperature of the barrel wall may conveniently be lower than the incoming chocolate or fat-containing confectionery material but, in some circumstances, the temperature of the barrel wall may be higher than the incoming chocolate or fat-containing confectionery material. The slippage of the fat-containing confectionery material against the barrel wall may also be reduced by roughening the barrel wall, e.g. by rifling such as forming longitudinal or spiral grooves in the wall. The spiral grooves preferably run in the opposite direction to the pitch of the screw and preferably have a longer pitch than that of the screw. Conveniently, the temperature of the screw is greater than the temperature of the barrel wall, for instance, by from 5° to 50° C., preferably from 10° to 40° C. and more preferably from 12° to 30° C. In one advantageous embodiment the diameter of the screw root increases from the upstream to the downstream end while the pitch remains constant. In another advantageous embodiment the pitch of the screw decreases from the upstream to the downstream end while the diameter of the screw root remains constant. The compression ratio of the screw may be from 1:1 to 5:1 and preferably from 1.5:1 to 3:1. Compression ratios above 5:1 may cause blockages of the material being extruded. The ratio of length to diameter of the screw may be, for instance, from 5:1 to 30:1 and preferably from 10:1 to 25:1. The diameter of the screw may be, for example from 20 to 500 mm. The screw speed may be, for example, from 1 to 500 rpm. The actual screw diameter and screw speed may be selected by the person skilled in the art according to the requirements. The throughput depends on the screw speed and may be, for instance, from 1 to 5000 kg/hr according to requirements. As also described in the afore-noted European &#39;467 Application, the sectional geometry of the die may be of a square or profiled form. Typically, it might be a conical entry with an inlet cone angle of from 10° to 90°. The flow rate of the chocolate through the extruder die will depend amongst other things on extrusion pressure, temperature, die configuration and material formulation. Extrusion rates may vary from 0.1 cm/second to in excess of 1 meter/second, for instance. A wide variety of die shapes may be used and the extruded fat-containing confectionery material may have a solid, profiled or hollow section and essentially has the same shape as the die, e.g. rods, spirals, twists, springs, hollow sections such as tubes and more complex shapes such as the letters of the alphabet as well as thin films having a thickness which may be as little as 100 microns. The dimensions of the die depend on the desired size of the extruded product. If desired, two or more fat-based confectionery materials may be extruded in accordance with the process of the present invention. In addition, the chocolate or fat-containing confectionery material may be co-extruded with other food materials such as ice cream, sorbet, yoghurt, mousse, fondant, praline, marshmallow, nougat or jelly, etc., such being advantageous when the fat-containing confectionery material is extruded in a hollow or tubular form. Hence, in such embodiments, a multi-orifice die and/or associated equipment, as are known to those skilled in the art, may be employed. If desired, a twin screw extruder may be used and may be either one using counter-rotating screws or one using co-rotating screws. The temperature of the chocolate or fat-containing confectionery material as it is extruded may conveniently be from 15° to 28° C., more usually from 18 to 25° C., e.g. from 20° to 23° C. The present invention is further described by way of example only with reference to the accompanying drawing.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to furniture such as chairs which are made up of interwoven slats, and methods for manufacturing such furniture. More specifically, the invention relates to furniture and manufacturing methods in which slats are arranged in an interlocking lattice structure. It has been and remains a goal of fine furniture manufacturers to provide furniture that is simultaneously aesthetically pleasing, ergonomically comfortable, physically sturdy, and economical to manufacture. One way to keep manufacturing costs down, is to make furniture from a minimum number of parts. By minimizing the number and types of parts, it becomes easier to assemble a chair into a finished product. This results in simplification and streamlining of the manufacturing process. For aesthetic appeal, it is often thought desirable to provide furniture which is not &#34;boxy&#34; or &#34;clumsy&#34; in appearance. The furniture should project an appearance of lightness and stylishness. Sometimes the goals of physical lightness and economy of manufacture are in conflict. For example, if the surface of a chair were manufactured of a web of light-weight material, the weight-bearing frame of the chair has ordinarily been of different, heavier elements such as thick wooden or metal rods. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 151,967 and U.S. Pat. No. 12,144. In such known furniture, simplicity of manufacture has been compromised for the benefit of sturdiness. In order to accomplish the aesthetic goal, light-weight material is advantageously employed. Lightness may be accomplished by using material which is thin, to avoid giving the furniture a bulky or boxy appearance. Unfortunately, using thin material which also satisfies the goal of structural strength has traditionally required use of metals, which in turn has prevented the furniture from being economical to manufacture. Wood, because of its appearance and ease of working, is a common material for furniture. Further, wood has the advantage of thermal insulation, which, in practice, means that it does not feel uncomfortably cold in winter and painfully hot in summer. For ergonomic comfort, flexible and shaped materials are used to allow the furniture to flex and fit the shape of the body of the user. Traditional wood furniture with its thickness and hardness has not often fulfilled these criteria. However, in certain cases, furniture which has been constructed of wood has been thicker than desirable, in order to meet demands of structural strength. See, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 12,144. Further, furniture made of wood often requires a large number of different parts, such as when thick wooden structural elements support thinner elements, such as the visible faces of the furniture. Therefore, there is a need to provide furniture, and a method of manufacturing the same, in which the furniture is manufactured of a small number of different types of parts, thereby simplifying construction. There is a also need to provide furniture, and a method of manufacturing the same, in which the furniture is sturdy. There is further a need to provide furniture, and a method of manufacturing the same, in which the furniture is aesthetically pleasing. There is a further need to provide furniture which is ergonomically sound and comfortable. The present invention is directed toward filling those needs. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Furniture according to the present invention comprises a strong, aesthetically appealing, ergonomically comfortable, woven lattice of interlocking slats. In a preferred embodiment, the slats are made of a wood laminate having indentations allowing fitting of the slats across one another so as to form the flat surfaced lattice. Advantageously, furniture according to the present invention may be manufactured of a single type of material, such as bent wood laminate slats. No other support structural material is needed to make the furniture simultaneously possess the advantages of being sturdy, aesthetically appealing, and economical to manufacture. Similarly, the use of independent and connected slats allow different parts of the chair to flex and bend to ergonomically conform to the end user&#39;s body. The invention also provides methods of manufacturing such furniture. For example, in a preferred method, strips of material to be laminated are placed on a primary form in layers with an adhesive substance spread between adjacent strips. A caul strip is placed over the stack of strips. A sheet of rigid material is then placed over the caul strip. A secondary form and blocks are placed over the sheet of rigid material after which pressure is applied to the blocks and secondary form. After the adhesive substance dries, the blocks, secondary form, sheet of rigid material, and caul are removed. Then the laminated slats are lifted from the primary form. A plurality of slats made by this process are then woven into a piece of furniture. Another method employing sheets or shells of laminated material that are subsequently cut into slats is also contemplated. Thus, it is a primary object of the present invention to provide furniture, and methods of making furniture, in which the furniture is sturdy, aesthetically pleasing, ergonomically fit and economical to manufacture. It is a further object of the invention to provide furniture, and methods of making furniture, in which the furniture is manufactured of a small number of different parts, such as slats of a light but strong material such as wood laminate. These and other objects and advantages will become apparent when the specification is read taking into account the drawings.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to methods and devices for removing tissue samples, and more specifically to improved instruments and methods for acquiring soft body tissue. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is often desirable and frequently necessary to sample or remove a portion of tissue from humans and other animals, particularly in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with cancerous tumors, pre-malignant conditions, and other diseases or disorders. Typically, in the case of cancer, particularly cancer of the breast, there is a great emphasis on early detection and diagnosis through the use of screening modalities, such as physical examination, and particularly mammography, which is capable of detecting very small abnormalities, often nonpalpable. When the physician establishes by means of a mammogram or other screening modality, such as ultrasound, that suspicious circumstances exist, a biopsy must be performed to capture tissue for a definitive diagnosis as to whether the suspicious lesion is cancerous. Biopsy may be done by an open or percutaneous technique. Open biopsy, which is an invasive surgical procedure using a scalpel and involving direct vision of the target area, removes the entire mass (excisional biopsy) or a part of the mass (incisional biopsy). Percutaneous biopsy, on the other hand, is usually done with a needle-like instrument through a relatively small incision, blindly or with the aid of an artificial imaging device, and may be either a fine needle aspiration (FNA) or a core biopsy. In FNA biopsy, individual cells or clusters of cells are obtained for cytologic examination and may be prepared such as in a Papanicolaou smear. In core biopsy, as the term suggests, a core or fragment of tissue is obtained for histologic examination which may be done via a frozen section or paraffin section. The type of biopsy utilized depends in large part on circumstances present with respect to the patient, including the location of the lesion(s) within the body, and no single procedure is ideal for all cases. However, core biopsy is extremely useful in a number of conditions and is being used more frequently by the medical profession. A very successful type of image guided percutaneous core breast biopsy instrument currently available is a vacuum-assisted automatic core biopsy device. One such successful biopsy device is shown and disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,526,822 to Burbank et al, expressly incorporated by reference herein. This device, known commercially as the MAMMOTOME® Biopsy System, which is available from Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Inc., a division of Johnson &amp; Johnson, has the capability to actively capture tissue prior to cutting the tissue. Active capture allows for sampling through non-homogeneous tissues. The device is comprised of a disposable probe, a motorized drive unit, and an integrated vacuum source. The probe is made of stainless steel and molded plastic and is designed for collection of multiple tissue samples with a single insertion of the probe into the breast. The tip of the probe is configured with a laterally disposed sampling notch for capturing tissue samples. Orientation of the sample notch is directed by the physician, who uses a thumbwheel to direct tissue sampling in any direction about the circumference of the probe. A hollow cylindrical cutter severs and transports tissue samples to a tissue collection chamber for later testing. While this type of system functions very well as a core biopsy device, there are occasions when it may be useful to have the capability of acquiring a relatively large intact tissue sample. One such core biopsy device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,111,828, to Kornberg et al., also expressly incorporated by reference herein. In the device disclosed by Kornberg et al., the tissue receiving port is disposed at the distal end of the device and is oriented axially rather than laterally. A disadvantage of this type of device, however, is the inability to acquire a tissue sample having a cross-section larger than that of the cannula through which the sample will be removed. Additionally, it is difficult, using such a device, which obtains cylindrical shaped specimens, to determine whether an entire lesion of interest is being removed or whether a further procedure will be necessary. This is particularly true because most lesions of interest are typically spherical in shape, having a diameter of approximately 1 cm. The only way one can tell whether the entire lesion has been removed using the Kornberg technique is to remove and examine the specimen, determining whether each of the margins of the specimen is “clean”, meaning that there is no evidence of lesion, or “dirty”, meaning that lesion is evident right to the edge of the specimen. Of course, if one or more specimen margins is “dirty”, it is almost a certainty that a portion of the lesion remains in the patient, and if the biopsy test results on the lesion are positive, a further surgical procedure will be indicated. It would be desirable, therefore, to have an apparatus and method for isolating a target lesion, with a sufficient border around and beyond the lesion that the likelihood of “clean” margins is relatively high. It would further be advantageous to have an apparatus and method available for initially isolating the entire target lesion, by cutting a swath completely about the lesion to cut off its blood supply, after which a further procedure is undertaken to remove it from the patient&#39;s body. This approach would help to minimize the migration of possibly cancerous cells from the lesion to surrounding tissue or bloodstream during the removal procedure. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention addresses the foregoing problems by providing such an apparatus and method for precisely isolating a target lesion, resulting in a high likelihood of “clean” margins. This advantageously will often result in the ability to both diagnose and treat a malignant lesion with only a single percutaneous procedure, with no follow-up percutaneous or surgical procedure required, while minimizing the risk of migration of possibly cancerous cells from the lesion to surrounding tissue or the bloodstream. More particularly, in one aspect of the invention, a biopsy instrument is provided for retrieving body tissue, which instrument has a longitudinal axis. The instrument comprises a distal end adapted for entry into a patient&#39;s body, a shaft disposed along the axis, and a cutting element disposed along the shaft. The cutting element is actuatable between a radially retracted position and a radially extended position. Advantageously, the instrument is rotatable about its axis in the radially extended position to isolate a desired tissue specimen from surrounding tissue by defining a peripheral margin about the tissue specimen. Once the tissue specimen is isolated, it may be segmented by further manipulation of the cutting element, after which the tissue segments are preferably individually removed from the patient&#39;s body through a cannula or the like. Alternatively, the specimen may be encapsulated and removed as an intact piece. In another aspect of the invention, an instrument is provided for retrieving body tissue, having a longitudinal axis and comprising a distal end adapted for entry into a patient&#39;s body. The instrument further comprises an element for encapsulating a tissue specimen so that it may be withdrawn as a single unit from the patient&#39;s body. The encapsulating element preferably comprises a plurality of bands disposed along the instrument axis, each of which are actuatable between a radially retracted position and a radially extended position. In yet another aspect of the invention, a method is disclosed for retrieving a tissue specimen from a patient&#39;s body, comprising the steps of inserting an instrument having a distal end, a longitudinal axis, and an axially disposed cutting element, into the patient&#39;s body, so that a distal end is disposed in a tissue region from which the tissue specimen is to be taken. The cutting element is radially expanded so that a portion thereof is radially outwardly spaced from the axis of the instrument. Once the cutting element is radially expanded, it is rotated about the axis to cut the tissue and create a peripheral boundary about the tissue specimen, to isolate the tissue specimen from surrounding tissue in the tissue region.",

Straps on knapsacks in common use are secured at their opposite ends in place by sewn seams or rivets via suitable covering tabs as illustrated in FIG. 18 of the accompanying drawings in which the knapsack is indicated by K, the strap by S and the tabs by T. With the straps thus permanently secured to the fabric or leather web of the knapsacks, it is literally difficult to replace the straps per se when worn or damaged without tearing the tabs off, demanding purchase of a new whole knapsack. The prior art strapped knapsack has a further drawback in that because they are fixedly connected, the straps would be swerved to the sides if worn by a wide-shouldered person as indicated by phantom lines in FIG. 18 or would otherwise fail to fit comfortably to wearers of different constitution. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore the primary object of the present invention to provide means for eliminating the foregoing difficulties of the prior art and to this end, more specifically to provide a strap fastener which will enable removal of worn or damaged straps and attachment of new counterparts with utmost ease. Another object of the invention is to provide a strap fastener which will enable adjustment of the straps on for example a knapsack to fit different physical characteristics of the users. According to the invention, a strap fastener includes a socket member adapted to be mounted on the fabric of a bag, and a fastener body having means for retaining a strap, and a plug projecting from the back of the fastener body. The plug includes an enlarged head snappingly received in a stepped bore in the socket member to couple the fastener body with the socket member. The fastener body in coupled condition is rotatable about the axis of the plug with respect to the socket member. The fastener body may have a projection disposed adjacent to the plug and receivable in an elongate groove formed in the socket member to extend arcuately about the axis of the stepped bore to a limited angular extent. The socket member may be attached to the fabric of the bag by means of a mounting plate disposed on the fabric opposite to the socket member. With the mounting plate thus provided, the fastener body undergoes smaller frictional resistance imposed by the mounting plate than by the fabric of the bag when the fastener body is angularly displaced with respect to the socket member.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to medical devices, and more particularly to a radially expandable, endoluminal grafts which may be implanted within the lumen of a luminal anatomical structure. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In modern medical practice, it is common to implant radially expandable grafts and similar devices within body lumens (e.g., blood vessels, esophagus, common bile duct, ureter, urethra, fallopian tube, etc.) In general intraluminal grafts and their respective support and/or attachment means fall into two major categories, self-expanding and pressure expandable. Self-expanding intraluminal grafts, are formed of resilient or shape-memory material such as spring steel or Nitinol™. Self-expanding material is capable of being formed in a configuration from which it may be compressed to a radially compact diameter for placement within a damaged vessel. At the time of use, the memory feature of these materials causes them to self-expand from the radially compact diameter to the expanded operative diameter. Pressure-expandable intraluminal grafts are formed of plastically deformable material such as stainless steel that is initially formed in its radially compact diameter. This type of material does not have memory, and will remain in the radially compact diameter until manually expanded. Typically, outwardly directed pressure is exerted upon the graft through use of a balloon so as to cause radial expansion and resultant plastic deformation of the material to its operative diameter. The prior art has included numerous endovascular grafts of varying design. In general, these endovascular grafts typically comprise: a tube of pliable material (e.g., expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) or woven polyester) in combination with a graft anchoring component (e.g., a wireform, a frame, a series of wire rings, hooks, barbs, clips, staples, etc.) which operates to hold the tubular graft in its intended position within the blood vessel. Most commonly, the graft anchoring component is formed of a radially expandable frame (e.g., one or more radially-expandable wireforms of the type described hereabove) which is either a) incorporated into the body of the tubular graft or b) formed separately from the graft and positioned within the graft lumen, such frame being expandable to exert outwardly directed radial pressure against the surrounding blood vessel wall--thereby frictionally holding the graft in place. In operation, endovascular grafts which incorporate radially expandable graft anchoring devices are initially disposed in a radially collapsed configuration which is sufficiently compact to allow the graft to be transluminally advanced through the vasculature until it reaches the intended site of implantation. Thereafter, the graft (and the accompanying graft anchoring device) expands to a radially expanded configuration which is large enough to exert the desired outwardly-directed pressure against the blood vessel wall. In some embodiments, hooks, barbs, or other projections formed on the graft anchoring device, will insert into the wall of the blood vessel to ensure that the graft will be firmly held in its desired position, without slipping or migrating after implantation. Like the above-described wireforms, the radially expandable anchoring devices (e.g., frames or wireforms) of endoluminal grafts are generally classifiable as either a.) self-expanding or b) pressure-expandable. Graft anchoring devices of the self-expanding type are usually formed of a resilient material (e.g., spring metal) or shape memory alloy which automatically expands from a radially collapsed configuration to a radially expanded configuration, when relieved of surrounding constraint (e.g., a surrounding tubular sheath or catheter wall). On the other hand, those of the pressure-expandable variety are typically formed of malleable wire or other plastically deformable material which will deform to a radially expanded configuration in response to the exertion of outwardly directed pressure thereagainst--as by inflation of a balloon or actuation of another pressure-exerting apparatus which has been positioned within the graft anchoring device. In order to facilitate the transluminal, catheter based implantation of endoluminal grafts, it is typically desirable to minimize the diameter of the graft while in its radially compact configuration, thereby minimizing the required diameter of the delivery catheter used for delivery and implantation of the graft. In general, the smaller the diameter of the delivery catheter the smaller the size of the percutaneous puncture tract required for introduction of the catheter. Moreover, in many applications, it is necessary for the catheter to fit through relatively small body lumens and, thus, the diameter of the catheter must not exceed that of the body lumen(s) through which it must pass. Moreover, the act of radially compressing or collapsing a graft can result in the introduction of stress within the wireform. In some cases, the introduction of such stresses can adversely affect the performance of the graft following implantation. In view of these considerations, there exists a need in the art for the development of new wireforms which i) are capable of being radially compressed or radially collapsed to a small diameter so as to be useable in conjunction with relatively small diameter delivery catheters, and ii) will undergo minimal stress inducement during the radial compression/compaction process so as to minimize any deleterious effects that induced or residual stress may have on the subsequent performance and useful life of the graft. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides new grafts which are constructed to be radially collapsed and/or radially compressed to a small diameter. The wireforms of the present invention generally comprise a wire deformed into generally annular configuration and consisting of a plurality of curvilinear wave forms. The wave forms have a plurality of first apices in linear alignment with each other, a plurality of second apices in linear alignment with each other, and a plurality of curvilinear segments traversing back and forth between said first and second apices. This graft is i) initially disposable in a radially compact configuration of a first diameter and ii) subsequently expandable to a radially expanded configuration of a second diameter, said second diameter being larger than said first diameter. When in its radially compact configuration, the adjacent curvilinear segments of the wireforms will nest or seat in abutting contact with one another, thereby minimizing the diameter of the graft while in its radially compact configuration. Further in accordance with the invention, there are provided endoluminal or endovascular grafts which comprise one or more wireforms of the foregoing character, affixed to a pliable tubular graft such that the wireforms will act as a radially expandable graft anchoring device to frictionally anchor and hold the graft at its desired position within the lumen of a blood vessel or other anatomical conduit. Still further objects and advantages of the invention will be apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading and understanding the following detailed description of exemplary embodiments shown in the accompanying drawings.",

    "abstract": "The new primocane-fruiting raspberry cultivar designated ‘Pacific Gema’ is shown herein. Botanically known as  Rubus idaeus  L., ‘Pacific Gema’ is a primocane-fruiting raspberry resulting from a hand-pollinated cross of female parent ‘Pacific Deluxe’ (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 21,074), a previous release from the same program, and the unpatented male parent ‘414a’. Pollination occurred in April 2008 and seeds from this controlled cross were subsequently harvested, cleaned, germinated, and field-established as seedlings in spring 2009 in Santa Cruz County, Calif. ‘Pacific Gema’ was first identified in the aforementioned seedling field in May 2010 in Watsonville, Calif. This variety was first propagated asexually by crown division in autumn 2010 in Watsonville, Calif. USA. The crown on the original plant was dug and parted into basal cane pieces (approximately 15 cm long) with root attached and replanted into a selection plot elsewhere on the farm, resulting in a 3-fold increase in plant material. Harvest and postharvest data were collected from this larger plot of ‘Pacific Gema’ throughout 2011, In January 2012, two actively growing etiolated shoots that were forced from roots in a greenhouse were sent to Lafayette, Oreg., USA, where vegetative material was explanted and established in vitro for micropropagation. Subsequent asexual propagation was done on-site in Watsonville, Calif. and, along with tissue-cultured plantlets, ‘Pacific Gema’ was evaluated extensively over the next several years for performance and genetic stability. The present cultivar, ‘Pacific Gema’ offers many advantages over the existing, patented cultivar and maternal parent, ‘Pacific Deluxe’ (U.S. Plant Pat. No. 21,074) in that the root and subsequent cane vigor is significantly greater, floricane budbreak is more uniform, average fruit size is larger and more conic in shape. The increased vigor offers advantages in propagation, particularly in a nursery setting where roots are produced for sale to commercial growers. The improved floricane budbreak provides growers with a more reliable spring crop. The larger berries help growers fill baskets more quickly, leading to increased harvest efficiency. A second example of an existing, patented cultivar is ‘Pacific Majesty’, U.S. Plant Pat. No. 23,593, another previous release from the same program. The present cultivar, ‘Pacific Gema’ has superior flavor/aroma and higher field tolerance of Raspberry Bushy Dwarf Virus (RBDV) compared with ‘Pacific Majesty’. A third example of an existing, patented cultivar is ‘Rafzaqu’, U.S. Plant Pat. No. 19,512 (aka Himbo Top®). The present cultivar, ‘Pacific Gema’ has firmer fruit and more berries per inflorescense compared with ‘Rafzaqu’, though both are of similar height. Thus, these characteristics help define ‘Pacific Gema’ as a new and distinct cultivar of primocane-fruiting raspberry. ‘Pacific Gema’ may be recognized by its high vigor, uniform floricane budbreak, tall canes which are architecturally laden with conic berries and which consistently taste sweet and have a glossy appearance",

    "abstract": "The present invention is broadly concerned with automated, self-cleaning, low-maintenance and low-labor animal watering devices. More particularly, the invention is concerned with such watering devices and methods which provide automatic water filling of a livestock watering tank as water is consumed, as well as predictable, complete water drainage as necessary to reduce bacteria and algae buildup in the water, with only a minimum of fresh water usage for tank cleaning purposes. 2. Description of the Prior Art Providing adequate supplies of fresh water to farm animals, particularly cattle, is a prime prerequisite for maintaining animal health, well being, and growth. This is particularly the case in confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs) where heavy water consumption by many animals tends to create poor water quality conditions. That is, animal feed particles and other debris collects in watering tanks raising the bacterial count therein to unacceptable levels and promoting undesirable algae growth. It is also important that maintenance of animal watering tanks be as automated as possible CAFOs, needing only a minimum of operator intervention. In cattle feedlots, the daily labor required for continually filling, draining, and cleaning of standard, static water tanks can be excessive. Another CAFO animal watering problem is excessive use of water. In many locales, water constraints are imposed upon CAFOs, and thus is its important that only a minimum amount of water be wasted. Hence, the simple expedient of daily draining of water tanks, while potentially ameliorating the bacterial count and algae growth problems, uses undue amounts of fresh water. In response to these problems, it has been known to provide watering tanks equipped with a float mechanism and an associated water fill valve to control the water level in the tank. As the tank water level decreases owing to animal water consumption, the float mechanism operates to open the fill valve. Inasmuch as the tank is continuously refilled to the same level, there is a tendency for a contaminant or scum line to form, which requires significant and frequent cleaning of the tank. In other designs, an upper end of a watering tank is hingedly supported with a lift spring beneath the tank at the opposite end thereof. A water inlet valve is coupled to a source of water and the tank, and linkage between the tank and inlet valve is provided. As water is consumed from the tank, the spring biases the tank upwardly until a limit is reached. At this point the valve linkage serves to open the valve to refill the tank. Such a watering device is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,347,809. However, the &#39;809 patent device does not provide for automated tank drainage, but instead requires an operator to manually open a drain. U.S. Pat. No. 3,371,652 describes an automatic livestock watering device of the float control variety. This design is also equipped with an automatic drain assembly including an impeller located within the water inlet line and rotatable in response to inlet water flow. The impeller is operably coupled with a gear train carrying a lug. As the gear train rotates in response to water flow, the lug eventually contacts a toggle rod, which serves to open the drain assembly. Such a purely mechanical system is deficient because it fails to achieve predictable water drainage. Specifically, many CAFO watering sites are connected to well pumps of greatly differing water pressures, such that actuation of the impeller-operated drain assembly varies over a wide range. Furthermore, such well water is often contaminated with dirt or other debris, which can clog the impeller mechanism and prevent proper operation thereof. Other prior art animal watering devices are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,309,962 and 6,619,232. The systems disclosed in these patents do not provide a periodic automated drain function, and are thus deficient. There is accordingly a need in the art for improved animal watering devices especially useful in CAFO contexts, and which provides automated water fill and predictable drainage with only a minimal amount of fresh water wastage. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention overcomes the problems outlined above and provides improved, self-cleaning, low-maintenance, low cleaning water usage animal watering devices. Generally speaking, watering devices in accordance with the invention comprise a watering tank, and a support assembly operable to support the tank and to cause movement thereof between an elevated position corresponding to a lower water level in the tank, and a lowered position corresponding to a higher water level in the tank. Preferably, the tank is pivotally supported at one end thereof, and a lower lift spring adjacent the opposite end of the tank is positioned to bias the tank upwardly against the weight of water therein. The overall watering device further includes a selectively actuatable water fill assembly operably coupled with the tank in order to add water to the tank as necessary; the water fill assembly normally includes an electrically or mechanically operated fill valve coupled to a source of pressurized water, with a water line from the valve to the tank. Additionally, the watering device has a selectively actuatable drain valve assembly operably coupled with the tank in order to drain the tank, normally in the form of a motor or solenoid-operated gate, butterfly, or ball valve. A control assembly is operably coupled with the tank and the drain valve assembly, with the control assembly operable to actuate the drain valve assembly after a predetermined number of movements of the tank between the elevated and lowered positions thereof. The invention also provides a method of maintaining an animal watering device having a water tank moveable between an elevated position corresponding to a lower water level in the tank, and a lowered position corresponding to a higher water level in the tank, and to periodically drain the watering tank. This method comprising the steps of monitoring the position of the tank and successively adding water to the tank when the tank reaches the elevated position thereof corresponding to the lower water level, and in response thereto causing the tank to move to the lowered position corresponding to the higher water level therein. The method also involves draining water from the tank after a predetermined number of the movements of the tank between the elevated and lowered positions thereof. Such tank monitoring is preferably carried out using one or more tank position sensors coupled with a control device (which may be digital or analog), and is preferably a programmable logic controller, with the control device also operably coupled with a water inlet valve and drain valve.",

    "abstract": "Embodiments of this disclosure relate to medical devices and procedures. In particular, embodiments of the instant invention relate to medical devices and procedures for the treatment of obesity. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat accumulates to the extent that it may have an adverse effect on health. Medical practitioners have explored various surgical and non-surgical procedures for obesity management. Current medical methods for obesity treatment include surgery, gastric banding, intragastric balloons, and other related procedures. A well-explored surgical technique for obesity treatment includes gastric bypass, a procedure that creates a malabsorptive state in the patient by reducing the size of the stomach and bypassing a portion of the small intestine. Another surgical procedure, gastric bypass Roux-en-Y and staples, reduces the capacity of the stomach by creating a smaller stomach pouch. Although these procedures are effective, they posses some disadvantages, such as “dumping syndrome”, where the stomach contents are literally “dumped” rapidly into the small intestine, which may lead to nausea, weakness, sweating, faintness, and diarrhea. Next to surgical methods, a patient may choose less invasive methods to lose weight. Gastric banding, for example, employs a gastric band, placed around the top portion of the stomach to restrict the amount of food that the patient can consume at one time. Unlike surgical procedures discussed above, gastric banding may be performed using minimally invasive techniques, and it does not require cutting or removal of part of the digestive system. Another example of a non-surgical, non-pharmaceutical aid in the treatment of obesity is the Intra Gastric Balloon (IGB) system. In this treatment procedure, a surgeon inserts an empty balloon into a patient&#39;s stomach and then inflates the balloon with either sterile saline or air. After inflation, the expanded balloon cannot pass into the bowel, so it remains within the stomach. The inflated balloon occupies a large portion stomach volume producing a feeling of fullness even when the patient eats a small amount of food. The conventional procedures noted above show positive results, but each method can result in harmful side effects and complications. The Intra-gastric balloon for instance, may cause obstruction within the intestine. For example, the balloon may become situated at the pylorus or within the small intestine. Other major complications reported through minimally invasive techniques of obesity management include—productive burping, gastritis, or slippage of an implanted gastric band, leading to inefficient obesity management. Thus, a device that provides better obesity management is desirable. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with one embodiment, there is provided a medical device that includes a shell alterable between a deformed and an unstressed state defining a cavity, a magnet disposed within the cavity, and a filler material carried within the cavity conforming to the interior shape of the shell in the unstressed state and holding its shape in the deformed state. In some embodiments, the filler material converts from the deformed state to the unstressed state at a temperature equal to or less than human body temperature. The shell of the medical device may be spherical in shape and made up of a flexible material. In addition, the shell may include an anti-bacterial coating on its surface. Further, the magnet of the medical device may be rod-shaped and may be made up of a permanent rare-earth magnet such as neodymium. The medical device may also involve a filler to configure between the unstressed and deformed states. Here, the filler may include a fluid. Moreover, the medical device can employ a catheter to deform the device in ellipse shape during deployment. Further, according to the disclosure, there is provided a method for obesity control, the method including introducing one or more medical devices into the stomach. The medical device can include a shell configurable between a deformed and an unstressed state defining a cavity, a magnet disposed within the cavity, and a filler material carried within the cavity conforming to the interior shape of the shell in the unstressed state and holding its shape in the deformed state. The method may further include formation of medical devices cluster held by magnetic interaction, and continuous rearrangement of cluster resulting from abdominal muscle energy expenditure and magnetic interactions. Here, the medical device is present in its deformed state while introduction in the stomach and reverts to the unstressed state within the stomach. Still further, in some embodiments, the present disclosure also provides a system for obesity control, the system including a sheath having a proximal end, a distal end, a lumen extending there between, and one or more medical devices disposed within the lumen. The medical device may include a shell configurable between a deformed and an unstressed state defining a cavity, a magnet disposed within the cavity, and a deformation mechanism co-located with the magnet in the cavity. In addition, the system provides medical device, configured in a deformed state while within the lumen and an unstressed state after exiting from the distal end of the sheath. Here, the deformation mechanism includes a filler and a catheter. Typically, the configuration of the shell is spherical when in the unstressed state and elliptical in the deformed state. In addition, the device may be flexible with a coated shell and rod-shaped magnet. Additional objects and advantages of the invention will be set forth in part in the description that follows, and in part will be obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice of the invention. The objects and advantages that the invention will be realized and attained by means of the elements and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended claims.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to tray assembly slidably mounted within a cabinet and provided with an expandable assembly and a plurality of tines to support items therein. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Today&#39;s modern kitchens are provided with an abundance of storage space, but none are used more than the kitchen cabinet. These cabinets are used to store dinnerware such as bowls, plates, and the like, in a stacked format. Additionally, they are used to store cookware such as pots, pans, lids, and the like as well. Unfortunately, this stacked arrangement often means that several items must be removed until the user can get at the one he or she needs. This not only a time-consuming process, but also exposes other pieces of dinnerware or cookware to possible damage from chipping or even breaking. Accordingly, there exists a need for a means by which desired dinnerware and cookware items can be easily removed from a kitchen cabinet, without impacting other items, and without exposing them to possible chipping or damage. The development of the expandable cabinet tray fulfills this need. The expandable cabinet tray is a storage apparatus for kitchen cabinets that holds various dinnerware and cookware items. The invention is intended to increase usability of the kitchen cabinets as well as prevent damage to the stored items. The invention is comprised of an overall stainless steel frame which fits into the upper wall section of a kitchen cabinet. It is provided with an adjustment mechanism to securely install the invention in place. The frame provides an inner moving mechanism which extends in and out of the cabinet area. In turn, this extension portion includes adjustable dividers for storing each individual piece of dinnerware, such as bowls, plates, cups, or the like. It can also be used to store cookware such as pots, pans, lids, and similar products. As such, at no time does any piece of dinnerware or cookware touch another item. This makes it very easy to remove one item, without having to move other items for access. Additionally, it prevents damage to the item by eliminating the possibility of chipping or breaking. It is envisioned that the present invention could be easily installed in almost any type of kitchen cabinet with a minimal amount of tools, and could be removed at a later date, without leaving any telltale marks behind. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The expandable cabinet tray is designed with utility and convenience in mind, and is easy to install and use. The tray consists of a primary base plate and an expanding base plate, which are attached to the inside of the cabinets with adhesive pads, such as mastic. This way, no damage to the cabinet would exist. However, if desired, permanent installation could be achieved by using threaded fastening mechanisms. Base assemblies are preferably stainless steel, and adhesive pads would be placed on the underside of the horizontal portion of each of the primary base plate and expanding base plate. The slide roller bearing on the inside of the primary base plate would allow the expanding base plate to slide out easily. The tray has a primary frame floor in the form of a stainless steel plate, and support tines are attached to the primary frame floor to hold items vertically. The support tines are stainless steel wires. Disposed along the outside of the support tine assembly of the primary frame, a short distance above the primary frame floor, is a primary frame brace, preferably comprised of stainless steel wire for the purpose of supporting the dishware in the apparatus. The floor of the expansion frame is a series of stainless steel plates, welded to the expanding frame side member of the expanding frame and spaced so as to bypass the support tines attached to the primary frame floor. In operation, the pull out tray assembly comprising of the primary frame and the extending frame with integral floors and, and support tines may be extended from the cabinet either partially or fully on the slide roller bearings and for the removal or insertion of glassware, dishware, and/or cookware. The items in the tray would be supported on or against the tines on the primary frame floor.",

    "abstract": "GB-A-765,371, discloses a method of making shoe-trees in which a plater cast is made of the front part of an individual&#39;s foot and fixed to an end piece to form a shoe tree. Such a shoe tree suffers the disadvantage that the plaster cast reflects the shape of the external surface of the individual&#39;s foot when the foot is not restrained by an article of footwear. Since much of contemporary fashion footwear causes an individual&#39;s foot to be deformed to some extend, a shoe-tree formed in accordance with GB-A-765,371 would not necessarily be insertable in such fashion footwear. GB 476,323 discloses a method for making an orthopaedic last derived from an orthopaedically correct old shoe, from which last an orthopaedically correct arch of a new shoe can be subsequently manufactured. The orthopaedic last is formed by filling the orthopaedically correct old shoe with a plastic material and allowing said material to set. Such a method suffers from the disadvantage that it can only be performed using old shoes whose bodies do not comprise straps or apertures since such footwear could not contain the un-set plastic material. The methods of GB 476, 323 would not therefore be suitable for many styles of contemporary fashion footwear. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention there is provided a method of manufacturing a last for a first article of footwear, the last comprising a cast shaped and dimensioned to customise, in use, one end of the first article of footwear for one end of the individual&#39;s foot; and an end piece adapted to engage, in use, the opposite end of the first article of footwear, said method comprising the steps of customising the cast for said one end of the individual&#39;s foot; and fixing the cast to the end piece. Preferably, the customising step comprises forming the cast from the internal surface of one end of a second article of footwear. Alternatively, the customising step comprises forming a mould of the external surface of one end of the individual&#39;s foot; and forming the cast from the mould. Preferably, the cast is formed by lining the internal surface of one end of the second article of footwear; and filling the lining with a material which is suitable for forming the cast. Further preferably, the lining is formed from latex rubber or the like. Advantageously, the method additionally comprises the step of customising the end piece for the opposite end of the individual&#39;s foot. More advantageously, the customising step comprises forming the end piece from the internal surface of said opposite end of the second article of footwear. Even more advantageously, the end piece is formed by lining the internal surface of said opposite end of the second article of footwear; and filling the lining with a castable material. Alternatively, the customising step comprises forming a mould of the external surface of the opposite end of the individual&#39;s foot; and forming the end piece from the mould. According to a second aspect of the invention, there is provided a last for a first article of footwear, the last comprising a cast shaped and dimensioned to customise, in use, one end of the first article of footwear for one end of an individual&#39;s foot; an end piece adapted to engage, in use, the opposite end of the first article of footwear; and means for fixing said cast to said end piece. Preferably, the cast conforms substantially to the shape of the internal surface of one end of a second article of footwear. More preferably, the end piece conforms substantially to the shape of the internal surface of the opposite end of the second article of footwear. Even more preferably, the internal surface of the second article of footwear has been pre-shaped by the individual&#39;s foot through wear.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to the field of portable beverage containers and more specifically relates to hand-held containers for mixing and transporting multiple powder-based beverages in one unit. DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART Many individuals in modern society find themselves away from home for the majority of any given day. Planning ahead to carry along sufficient beverages to keep one hydrated and refreshed is not only time-consuming, but the weight inherent in hauling several beverages may be cumbersome. Stopping periodically throughout the day at vending machines, convenience stores, and the like once again takes up valuable time and consumes what many consider to be non-disposable monetary resources. Without the availability of cupboards and refrigerators to rely upon when away from home, obtaining a beverage to slake one&#39;s thirst can be time consuming, expensive, and inconvenient. Many people like to mix powdered drinks for consumption during the course of the day. Often times this is highly inconvenient. Various attempts have been made to solve the above-mentioned problems such as those found in U.S. Pat. and Pub. Nos. 2,665,816; 2008/0072433; 6,705,491; 3,321,097; 4,691,821; 3,743,520; 4,194,619; 7,562,770; and 2006/0254936. This prior art is representative of portable beverage containers. None of the above inventions and patents, taken either singly or in combination, is seen to describe the invention as claimed. Ideally, a hand-held container for mixing and transporting multiple powder-based beverages should be compact, versatile, user friendly and, yet would operate reliably and be manufactured at a modest expense. Thus, a need exists for a reliable portable multi-beverage container system to increase the convenience of mixing and transporting a variety of powder-based beverages and to avoid the above-mentioned problems. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known portable beverage container art, the present invention provides a novel OTG (On The Go) Specialty Multi-Beverage Container system. The general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a convenient hand-held means of mixing and transporting a variety of powder-based beverages in one device and/or assembly. A portable multi-beverage container and mixing system is disclosed herein preferably comprising: a container housing, preferably comprising plastic, having at least one or a plurality of isolated inner volumes. The container comprises a lid having a plurality of compartments and at least one drink access spout. In preferred embodiments, the lid is coupleable to the container housing and comprises a sealable containment assembly which preferably comprises a thermal insulator. This thermal insulator effectively ensures the beverage surrounded by the container is kept at a lower temperature or an elevated temperature over an extended duration. In preferred embodiments, the lid houses a plurality of compartments for the containment of at least one powdered beverage mix. Each compartment preferably comprises an external door for admitting a powdered beverage mix and an internal door for releasing a powdered beverage mix. The internal door (or lid) may comprise a compressible button, latch, lever, or the like that when triggered releases the internal door from a closed position to an open position (and back to a closed position when done), thereby allowing any powdered beverage mix contained in the compartment to fall into the water contained in the container housing. A set of opposing polarity magnets is preferably used to attach an internal door to the container housing in a closed position. These magnets may also be used to draw an internal door into a closed position from an open position after the button, latch, lever, etc. has been released. Springs or other suitable (equivalent) means may be used to return the internal door to its normally closed position. For transportation purposes, the container housing may be coupled with the lid to define a cylinder capable of transporting beverages by hand-held means. For mixing purposes, the container housing may comprise markings used as volume measurement indicators along the outside surface of the housing. In this way, the powdered beverage mix may yield a sport drink or a non-sport drink when mixed with water. A user of a multi-beverage container system may carry and mix various powdered beverage mixes with water using this system throughout the day. The multiple compartments preferably found in the lid of the device allow users to separately carry: multiple servings of a single beverage, individual servings of unlike beverages, or a combination of servings of like and unlike beverages in one container. At desired intervals throughout the day, a user of a multi-beverage container system may access and consume these desired beverages using the drink access spout on the lid. A method of using a multi-beverage container and mixing system is also described herein preferably comprising the steps of: pouring water into at least one inner volume of a container housing through an external and/or internal door (or through a spout or by removing the lid to access) into a/the desired inner volume; closing at least one internal door; placing at least one powdered beverage mix inside at least one compartment of a lid through an external door; closing the external door; and transporting the powdered beverage mix(es) and water in an unmixed state. The method preferably further comprises the steps of: activating the internal door via a push-button; and mixing the powdered beverage mix from at least one compartment of the lid with water in the inner volume of the container housing at a user-preferred interval, yet not mixing other powdered beverage mix(es) stored in other compartments of the lid, allowing the mix(es) to be mixed independently with water in the designated inner volume at later interval(s) (or by rinsing and re-filling the water if in a single inner volume.) The present invention holds significant improvements and serves as a portable beverage container system. For purposes of summarizing the invention, certain aspects, advantages, and novel features of the invention have been described herein. It is to be understood that not necessarily all such advantages may be achieved in accordance with any one particular embodiment of the invention. Thus, the invention may be embodied or carried out in a manner that achieves or optimizes one advantage or group of advantages as taught herein without necessarily achieving other advantages as may be taught or suggested herein. The features of the invention which are believed to be novel are particularly pointed out and distinctly claimed in the concluding portion of the specification. These and other features, aspects, and advantages of the present invention will become better understood with reference to the following drawings and detailed description.",

    "abstract": "The present invention comprises a stable and nontoxic soft gel Coenzyme Q 10  formulation and process methodology of Coenzyme Q 10  for maximum Coenzyme Q 10  levels in the human body for a given input. A preferred soft gel formulation includes Coenzyme Q 10  (hereinafter CoQ 10 ), Vitamin E, beta-carotene, bee&#39;s wax, medium chain triglycerides available as MCT Myglyol S12, and rice bran oil formulated to maximize the body&#39;s absorption by maintaining the CoQ 10  in what may be a supersaturated solution in easily absorbed materials, that can provide healthful effects, as opposed to just fillers. It is important as much of the supplied CoQ 10  be absorbed, rather than just taking megadoses at frequent intervals as the wholesale cost of CoQ 10  dry powder in quantity is as much as $2000 per kg. Not only is a relatively large percentage of the CoQ 10  absorbed, but the volume of the soft gel capsule is minimized, making it easier to swallow and requiring smaller shipping and storage space. Recent studies indicate the preferred soft gel CoQ 10  formulation should be administered twice a day in dosages of about 30 mg CoQ 10  in 220 mg capsules, as that amount of CoQ 10  is about the maximum the body of a healthy sedentary adult can use for maintenance of a preferred blood level. For those who have deficiencies of CoQ 10 , studies have shown that twice a day administration of about 60 mg CoQ 10  in 435 mg capsules is advantageous. In special instances of CoQ 10  deficiency, twice a day ingestion of 100 mg CoQ 10  containing soft gel capsules can be tolerated. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a soft gel formulation of CoQ 10  and a methodology of formulation processing that produce a significantly greater bioavailability percentage of ingested CoQ 10  than existing soft or dry formulations. Another object of the present invention is to provide a soft gel formulation of CoQ 10  and methodology of administration that produces greater absorption of CoQ 10  into the intestine. Another object is to minimize the ingested volume required to maintain a given CoQ 10  blood content. Another object is to provide a process that keeps CoQ 10  in solution in readily absorbed materials, that themselves have beneficial effects.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a fire extinguishing agent. In particular, the present invention relates to a fire extinguishing agent for extinguishing multiple classes of fires. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Many metals and metal compounds are flammable. When ignited, a metal may act as the fire&#39;s fuel and may be oxidized by a number of elements and/or compounds. Most metals prone to ignite may produce fires of extremely high temperatures and may be difficult to extinguish. The classification for fires involving metals and/or metal compounds are commonly known as “Class D” fires. Examples of these metals include, but are not limited to, lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, cesium, francium, beryllium, titanium, uranium, and plutonium. Some metal compounds, such as, for example, alkyllithiums, Grignards and diethyizinc, are pyrophoric organometalic reagents. Most pyrophoric organometalic reagents may burn at high temperatures and may react violently with, for example, water, air, and/or other chemicals. Because these materials react to produce extremely high temperature fires and are natural catalysts, they have the ability to extract oxidizers from their surrounding environment and/or from compounds normally used as fire extinguishing agents. These oxidizing agents are not necessarily oxygen-containing compounds. Many metals, such as, for example, magnesium, sodium, lithium, and potassium, once ignited, will burn in, for example, gases containing nitrogen, chlorine, fluorine, sulfur, and/or sulfur. The gases may disassociate common fire extinguishing agents, such as, for example, carbon dioxide and Halon® to free radicals needed to support their combustion. One example of how reactive these metals are is demonstrated by the modern aircraft flare. This type of flare is not compounded from traditional oxidizers such as potassium nitrate or potassium chlorate, which are rich in oxygen, but are in fact a mixture of finely powdered magnesium and Teflon®. Teflon® is considered to be one of the least reactive materials known to man and contains no oxygen. Once ignited, however, Teflon® decomposes to release fluorine, which acts as its oxidizing agent. The reaction tends to be more vigorous and tends to produce temperatures hotter than would be possible with oxygen. When water comes into contact with some of these metals, such as, for example, lithium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium, hydrogen gas is dissociated from the water and a hydroxide radical is formed. The hydrogen gas formed by this reaction is a very combustible gas and may be often ignited by heat generated by the decomposing metal/water reaction. In such reactions, a dangerous situation may result if certain chemicals used in fire extinguishers are applied to certain types (e.g., classes) of fires. In fact, some dangerous situations are sometimes associated with the above reactions. For example, some fire fighting training manuals include warnings such as, for example, the following warning: “It is vital to know what type of extinguisher you are using. Using the wrong type of extinguisher for the wrong type of fire can be life-threatening.” When metals and/or metal compounds are shipped from one location to another, they may often be shipped in containers and/or on pallets with other types of freight, such as, for example, plastic parts and/or paper boxes. The resulting mixture of freight types, if involved in a fire, may likely require different types of fire extinguishing agents in order to effectively extinguish the different classes of fires (e.g., Class A, Class B, and/or Class D fires). Fire extinguishing agents sometimes used to safely extinguish Class D fires (e.g., those types of fires sometimes associated with metals and/or metal compounds) may not be desirable for extinguishing other classes of fires. As a result, such agents may require adherence to special procedures for effective use, such as the following procedure for using an agent sold under the trade name, “Purple K®”: “Apply the dry powder. Completely cover the burning metal with a thin layer of powder. Once control is established, take a position that is in close range. Throttle the stream with the nozzle valve to produce a soft, heavy flow. Cover the metal completely with a heavy layer of powder. Be careful not to break the crust formed by the powder. Slowly open the nozzle of the extinguisher.” When shipping a mixture of types of freight (e.g., metals and/or metal compounds, plastic materials, and/or paper boxes), however, it may not be possible to follow such rules, for example, because it may not be practical to orient the freight in a manner where freight containing metals and/or metal compounds would be positioned in such a way to allow the fire extinguishing agent (e.g., fire extinguishing powder) to cover all exposed sides of that type of freight. For example, if a container of metallic sodium were shipped, it might be loaded high on or in the middle of a built-up pallet load of other freight contained in cardboard boxes. As the cardboard boxes burn during a fire, the freight load might constantly shift and thereby re-expose the burning sodium following coverage with extinguishing powder. Further, because of sodium&#39;s low melting point, the sodium might simply melt and run out from under the powdered agent. Freight shipments sometimes referred to as “Hazardous Freight” shipments may often include a mixture of types of materials. As a result, if such a freight shipment were to catch fire, it might generate various classes of fires (e.g., Class A, Class B, and/or Class D fires). No single conventional fire extinguishing agent, however, exists that is desirable for extinguishing all such classes of fires. In most situations, for example, attempting to extinguish a mixed class fire, including a Class D fire along with a Class A and/or a Class B fire, may be futile due, for example, to the differing needs of fire extinguishing agents for different fire classes. For example, if active elements such as Halon® and/or one of the known Halon® replacement agents are used to extinguish a Class D fire, a dangerous situation might result. There may exist a need for a fire extinguishing agent that may be used to effectively and/or safely extinguish a fire including burning metals and/or metal compounds. Further, there may exist a need for a fire extinguishing agent that may be used to effectively and/or safely extinguish a fire including burning metals and/or metal compounds along with other types of burning materials. The invention may seek to satisfy one or more of the above-mentioned needs. Although the present invention may obviate one or more of the above-mentioned needs, it should be understood that some aspects of the invention might not necessarily obviate them. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In the following description, certain aspects and embodiments will become evident. It should be understood that the invention, in its broadest sense, could be practiced without having one or more features of these aspects and embodiments. It should be understood that these aspects and embodiments are merely exemplary. In one aspect, as embodied and broadly described herein, the invention includes a fire extinguishing agent that may include a foam and at least one inert gas combined with the foam. As used herein, the term “inert gas” means at least one gas selected from helium, neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and radon in concentrations greater than concentrations naturally occurring in air (e.g., concentrations normally associated with commercially-available bottled, inert gas). In another aspect, the invention includes a method of extinguishing a fire including a burning metal and/or a burning metal compound. The method may include combining a foam and at least one inert gas to form a fire extinguishing agent, and applying the fire extinguishing agent to the fire. According to a further aspect, the invention includes a method of extinguishing a fire including a burning metal and/or a burning metal compound and also including a burning plastic material and/or a burning paper material. The method may include combining a foam and at least one inert gas to form a fire extinguishing agent, and applying the fire extinguishing agent to the fire. In still a further aspect, the invention includes a method of extinguishing a fire including a Class D fire. The method may include combining a foam and at least one inert gas to form a fire extinguishing agent, and applying the fire extinguishing agent to the fire.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to devices for pressing, imprinting and cooking flat bread products. Specifically, the device can imprint an image, shape or word directly onto tortillas, pizza shells, chapati bread or pita bread. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Many Mexican restaurants are proud of their names and would imprint that name on the tortillas they serve if they could. Unfortunately, there has never been a device which could imprint the name onto the surface of such flat bread products. The imprinting of bakery products typically involves the utilization of a mold in which the bakery product batter dough is poured and cooked. The batter conforms to the mold during cooking and keeps its shape thereafter. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 2,358,452 to Garstang shows an circular design for a waffle iron allows designs to be made in a waffle. The waffle iron has a recessed patterned surface on the bottom and a top surface bearing a pattern or design to be cooked into the waffle. Both the top and the bottom plates are electrically heated. In operation, waffle batter is poured into the iron, the iron is then closed and activated. The waffle batter is formed and cooked at the same time and then removed from the iron. A second example of the prior art is found in U.S. Pat. No. 2,791,960 to Pietropinto, which discloses a device for making cookies and edible articles such as waffles or wheat cakes. This device is formed by a heated upper plate and an adjustable lower plate. The upper plates bears the design to be imprinted on the waffle. The lower plate or &#34;dough receiving pocket&#34; is an adjustable cavity which allows the thickness of the waffle to be varied. Both the upper and lower plates are hinged together and electrically heated. In operation, waffle dough or cookie dough is placed between the plates, which are then closed, forming and cooking the batter or dough placed between the plates. The present invention deals with pressing, imprinting and cooking tortilla dough, pizza dough or pita bread dough, all essentially flat bread products. Dough for such flat bread products has distinctively different characteristics from waffle batter or cookie dough. Cooking a flat bread product generally, requires two steps. The first step involves pressing a piece of dough into a flat disk on a set of heated plates. The second step requires that the flat disk of dough be placed on a grill to complete cooking on both sides. Additionally, during the cooking process, the bread dough rises, creating patterns in the surface of the bread product as well as air pockets and other irregularities. The rising of the dough during cooking makes a single step of pressing, imprinting and cooking impossible. There are several examples of presses and baking machines for flat bread products in the prior art; however, none of these machines imprint a design on the bread products. The closest prior art was invented by the present applicant. The first was U.S. Pat. No. 4,508,025 disclosing a tortilla press and oven unit. This machine presses and forms tortillas and then delivers them to a plurality of roasting oven disks. The tortilla is initially pressed between a set of heated press plates, then it is transferred to a first oven disk to partially cook the tortilla. It is then transferred to a second and third disk, being flipped over in between, to complete cooking of the bread product. The device is complex, and does not have the ability to imprint the bread products as they are pressed and cooked. Additionally, the slide used to flip the bread product often causes the bread product to stick and jam the machine. A second example is U.S. Pat. No. 4,683,813 to the applicant. In this invention an improved synchronized press and method for forming bakery products is disclosed. A single heated plate is pressed downward against a heated parallel rotating disk and synchronized to match the motion of the rotating disk. This movement presses a dough ball into a flat bread product which is then cooked on several rotating disks. No method of printing is disclosed. Also, the method disclosed to flip the tortilla and transfer it from one disk to another is the same as that used in other prior art patents, such as U.S. Pat. No. 4,508,025 and so it has the same sticking problems. A need exists for a press which can imprint a design on a flat bread product using at least two separate steps, imprinting and cooking. Moreover, a need exists for an imprinting press in combination with rotating cooking disks to aid in the convenience and compactness of a cooking unit. Finally, a need exists for an improvement to the prior art to aid in the transfer of a tortilla from one rotating cooking disk to the next. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, the present invention provides an imprinting press and cooking device whereby a bakery product such as a tortilla may be evenly pressed and imprinted in one step and cooked in a second step on a set of rotating disks which automatically turn and cook the bread product through the use of an air slide. An air pressure source for the air slide is also provided which forces ambient air through a conduit and into the air slide. The air slide is formed in a shape of a flat curved duct being perforated on one side. A mechanical driving system is provided whereby the disks are rotated in a simple, economical and dependable fashion. A heating system for the disks and the imprinting press is also provided. In a preferred embodiment, the imprinting press is electrically heated through the use of two heating elements. The rotating disks are heated through the use of gas burners, all of which are controlled through a central on/off switch. The present invention also provides a method for forming imprinted flat bread products. The method comprises the steps of depositing a portion of bakery dough into the press, pressing and imprinting the dough product and then removing the dough product to a conveyor to be cooked, one side at a time.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to intravascular prostheses and methods of percutaneous mitral annuloplasty while monitoring hemodynamic functions such as mitral valve regurgitation. 2. Description of the Related Art Dilated cardiomyopathy occurs as a consequence of many different disease processes that impair myocardial function, such as coronary artery disease and hypertension. The left ventricle enlarges and the ejection fraction is reduced. The resulting increase in pulmonary venous pressure and reduction in cardiac output cause congestive heart failure. Enlargement of the mitral annulus and left ventricular cavity produce mitral valvular insufficiency. This in turn, causes volume overload that exacerbates the myopathy, leading to a vicious cycle of progressive enlargement and worsening mitral regurgitation. According to recent estimates, more than 79,000 patients are diagnosed with aortic and mitral valve disease in U.S. hospitals each year. More than 49,000 mitral valve or aortic valve replacement procedures are performed annually in the U.S., along with a significant number of heart valve repair procedures. Various surgical techniques have been developed to repair a diseased or damaged valve. One repair technique which has been shown to be effective in treating incompetence, particularly of the mitral and tricuspid valves, is annuloplasty, in which the effective size of the valve annulus is contracted by attaching a prosthetic annuloplasty ring to the endocardial surface of the heart around the valve annulus. The annuloplasty ring comprises an inner substrate of a metal such as stainless steel or titanium, or a flexible material such as silicone rubber or Dacron cordage, covered with a biocompatible fabric or cloth to allow the ring to be sutured to the heart tissue. The annuloplasty ring may be stiff or flexible, may be split or continuous, and may have a variety of shapes, including circular, D-shaped, C-shaped, or kidney-shaped. Examples are seen in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,917,698, 5,061,277, 5,290,300, 5,350,420, 5,104,407, 5,064,431, 5,201,880, and 5,041,130, which are incorporated herein by reference. Annuloplasty rings may also be utilized in combination with other repair techniques such as resection, in which a portion of a valve leaflet is excised, the remaining portions of the leaflet are sewn back together, and a prosthetic annuloplasty ring is then attached to the valve annulus to maintain the contracted size of the valve. Other valve repair techniques in current use include commissurotomy (cutting the valve commissures to separate fused valve leaflets), shortening mitral or tricuspid valve chordae tendonae, reattachment of severed mitral or tricuspid valve chordae tendonae or papillary muscle tissue, and decalcification of the valve leaflets or annulus. Annuloplasty rings may be used in conjunction with any repair procedures where contracting or stabilizing the valve annulus might be desirable. Although mitral valve repair and replacement can successfully treat many patients with mitral valvular insufficiency, techniques currently in use are attended by significant morbidity and mortality. Most valve repair and replacement procedures require a thoracotomy, usually in the form of a median sternotomy, to gain access into the patient&#39;s thoracic cavity. A saw or other cutting instrument is used to cut the sternum longitudinally, allowing the two opposing halves of the anterior or ventral portion of the rib cage to be spread apart. A large opening into the thoracic cavity is thus created, through which the surgical team may directly visualize and operate upon the heart and other thoracic contents. Alternatively, a thoracotomy may be performed on a lateral side of the chest, wherein a large incision is made generally parallel to the ribs, and the ribs are spread apart and/or removed in the region of the incision to create a large enough opening to facilitate the surgery. Surgical intervention within the heart generally requires isolation of the heart and coronary blood vessels from the remainder of the arterial system, and arrest of cardiac function. Usually, the heart is isolated from the arterial system by introducing an external aortic cross-clamp through a sternotomy and applying it to the aorta to occlude the aortic lumen between the brachiocephalic artery and the coronary ostia. Cardioplegic fluid is then injected into the coronary arteries, either directly into the coronary ostia or through a puncture in the ascending aorta, to arrest cardiac function. The patient is placed on extracorporeal cardiopulmonary bypass to maintain peripheral circulation of oxygenated blood. Of particular interest in the present application are techniques for the repair and replacement of the mitral valve. The mitral valve, located between the left atrium and left ventricle of the heart, is most easily reached through the wall of the left atrium, which normally resides on the posterior side of the heart, opposite the side of the heart that is exposed by a median sternotomy. Therefore, to access the mitral valve via a sternotomy, the heart is rotated to bring the left atrium into an anterior position. An opening, or atriotomy, is then made in the right side of the left atrium, anterior to the right pulmonary veins. The atriotomy is retracted by means of sutures or a retraction device, exposing the mitral valve adjacent to the atriotomy. One of the previously identified techniques may then be used to repair or replace the valve. An alternative technique for mitral valve access has been used when a median sternotomy and/or rotational manipulation of the heart are inappropriate. In this technique, a thoracotomy is made in the right lateral side of the chest, usually in the region of the fourth or fifth intercostal space. One or more ribs may be removed from the patient, and other ribs near the incision are retracted outward to create a large opening into the thoracic cavity. The left atrium is then exposed on the posterior side of the heart, and an atriotomy is formed in the wall of the left atrium, through which the mitral valve may be accessed for repair or replacement. Using such open-chest techniques, the large opening provided by a median sternotomy or right thoracotomy enables the surgeon to see the mitral valve directly through the left atriotomy, and to position his or her hands within the thoracic cavity in close proximity to the exterior of the heart for cannulation of the aorta and/or coronary arteries to induce cardioplegia, manipulation of surgical instruments, removal of excised tissue, and introduction of an annuloplasty ring or a replacement valve through the atriotomy for attachment within the heart. Mitral valve surgery, including mitral annuloplasty, is usually applied to patients with intrinsic disease of the mitral apparatus. As described above, these patients may have scarring, retraction, tears or fusion of valve leaflets as well as disorders of the subvalvular apparatus. Definitive repair requires direct visualization of the valve. Patients who develop mitral regurgitation as a result of dilated cardiomyopathy do not have intrinsic mitral valve disease. Regurgitation occurs as the result of the leaflets being moved back from each other by the dilated annulus. The ventricle enlarges and becomes spherical, pulling the papillary muscles and chordae away from the plane of the valve and further enlarging the regurgitant orifice. In these patients, correction of the regurgitation does not require repair of the valve leaflets themselves, but simply a reduction in the size of the annulus and the sphericity of the left ventricle. Mitral annuloplasty without repair of the leaflets or chordae has been shown to be effective in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy who are refractory to conventional medical therapy. Bolling and coworkers have operated on a cohort of such patients with New York Heart Association Class III and IV symptoms. Average symptom severity decreased from 3.9 preoperatively to 2.0 after surgery. Hemodynamics and ejection fraction improved significantly. Other investigators have achieved similar results as well. However, the morbidity, risks and expense of surgical annuloplasty are very high in patients with cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure. Thus, a variety of new techniques for the treatment of congestive heart failure are being explored as adjuncts to drug therapy. Several cardiac restraint devices have been described. U.S. Pat. No. 5,702,343 to Alferness discloses a cardiac reinforcement device that is applied as a jacket over the epicardium in order to limit diastolic expansion. However, this requires an open chest operation to implant and does not directly affect the diameter of the mitral annulus. Another approach is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,961,440 to Schweich, et al., in which tension members are placed through opposite walls of the heart such that they span the ventricle. Less invasive and “minimally” invasive techniques for valve repair and replacement continue to evolve, both on a stopped heart and on a beating heart. These techniques may provide some benefits over open chest procedures, but they are still attended by significant morbidity and mortality risks. A need therefore remains for methods and devices for treating mitral valvular insufficiency, which are attended by significantly lower morbidity and mortality rates than are the current techniques, and therefore would be well suited to treat patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Optimally, the procedure can be accomplished through a percutaneous, transluminal approach, using simple, implantable devices which do not depend upon prosthetic valve leaflets or other moving parts. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION There is provided in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a method of treating a patient. The method comprises the steps of transluminally advancing a prosthesis into the coronary sinus, and manipulating the prosthesis to exert a compressive force on the mitral valve annulus. Hemodynamic function is monitored to assess mitral valve regurgitation. The monitoring step may comprise monitoring hemodynamic function prior to the manipulation step, during the manipulation step, and/or following the manipulation step. Preferably, the method comprises the step of percutaneously accessing the venous system prior to the transluminally advancing step. The accessing step may be accomplished by accessing one of the internal jugular, sub-clavian, or femoral veins.",

    "abstract": "Recently, in the field of orthodontics, aesthetically pleasing brackets have become increasingly popular. Typically these brackets are made of a material which is transparent, translucent or of a color substantially the same as the tooth. Therefore, these type orthodontic brackets are much more difficult to see with respect to the tooth. While the configuration of the bracket as illustrated in the &#39;430 patent does provide assistance in orienting and placement of these brackets on tooth, the color or lack thereof of these brackets has made it more difficult to view. Additionally, orthodontic brackets have been becoming increasingly smaller in size making viewing even more difficult. Applicant has invented an improved orthodontic bracket having means for enhancing the visual contrast of the bracket to assist in the alignment and placement of the bracket on the tooth. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one aspect of the invention there is provided an orthodontic bracket having a front labial face. The front face having at least one reference edge for alignment with a first reference plane and at least one second reference edge for alignment with a second reference plane. Means are provided for enhancing the visual contrast of the first and second reference edges with respect to the tooth so as to enhance the visibility of the first and second reference edges. In another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of making an orthodontic bracket comprising the steps of: (a) providing an orthodontic bracket with a front labial face having at least one reference edge for alignment, with a first reference plane and at least one second reference edge for alignment with respect to a second reference plane; and (b) placing a removable surface layer on the front labial face, the surface layer having a color which is distinct in appearance with respect to said tooth. In still another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of installing an orthodontic bracket on a tooth in a patient. The orthodontic bracket has a front labial face which has at least one reference edge for alignment with a first reference plane and at least one second reference edge for alignment with a second reference plane. The bracket also includes means for enhancing the visibility of the first and second reference edge with respect to said tooth, the method comprising the steps of: (a) securing the orthodontic bracket on the tooth of a patient using the first and second reference edges for alignment with the first and second reference planes, respectively; and (b) removing the means for enhancing the visibility of the first and second reference edges. In a further aspect of the present invention there is provided an orthodontic bracket for placement on a tooth. Removable means are provided on the front labial face of the bracket for providing at least one reference edge for alignment with a first reference plane and a second reference edge for alignment with a record second reference plane.",

In the normal practice of orthodontics, an orthodontic archwire is used to apply a force to cause irregular teeth to move in a desired direction. The archwire is secured to orthodontic brackets which are typically bonded directly to the surface of the tooth. It is important that these type brackets be bonded as accurately as possible to the tooth in the desired orientation. In this regard it has been suggested in the prior art to provide the outer configuration of the bracket with certain features for alignment with the anatomy of the tooth and occlusal plane. U.S. Pat.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to the field of illumination systems. In particular, the present invention relates to ophthalmic illumination systems and, more particularly, to a method and system for enhancing the useful lifetime of an ophthalmic illumination system. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Many ophthalmic surgical procedures require illuminating a portion of a patient&#39;s eye so that a surgeon can observe a surgical site. Various different types of instruments are known and available for use by an ophthalmic surgeon to illuminate the interior of the eye. For example, the handheld (probe) portion of a typical ophthalmic illuminator comprises a handle having a projecting tip and a length of optical fiber that enters a proximal end of the handle and passes through the handle and the tip to a distal end of the tip, from which light traveling along the optical fiber can project. The proximal end of the optical fiber can be optically coupled to a light source, such as in a high brightness illuminator, to receive the light that is transmitted through the fiber. These types of handheld illuminators are typically used by inserting the probe tip through a small incision in the eye. In this way, light from the illuminator light source is carried along the optical fiber, through the handpiece and emitted from the distal end of the probe (fiber) to illuminate the surgical site for the surgeon. Ophthalmic illumination systems that use a length of optical fiber to carry and direct light from a light source to a surgical site are well known in the art. Such ophthalmic illumination systems typically comprise a handheld portion including a probe, to deliver illumination from a light source housed in an enclosure. The enclosure typically houses the light source and associated optics that guide light from the light source to the optical fiber of a probe, a power supply, electronics with signal processing, and associated connectors, displays and other interfaces, as known to those having skill in the art. While some ophthalmic illumination systems use other types of lamps as a light source, a preferred light source is a xenon lamp. An ophthalmic illumination system xenon lamp typically has a relatively small arc (e.g., about 0.18 mm width for an Osram 75 W xenon bulb at zero hours operating time). Optics within the illumination system are used to focus an image of the arc onto the optical fiber of the probe and the xenon bulb must be precisely aligned to ensure that an optimum amount of light is coupled into the optical fiber, and hence an optimum luminous flux emerges from the fiber. The optical fiber core diameter is selected to be large enough that the arc image will fit within the fiber core area. However, as the xenon bulb ages, the bulb cathode degrades and moves away from the bulb anode. As the cathode degrades, the arc grows in size, decreases in peak luminance and the arc center moves away from the anode. The xenon bulb is positioned so that the arc image will fall on the optical fiber core entrance surface. In prior art illumination systems, the xenon bulb is positioned such that maximum fiber throughput is achieved at zero hours of operation (i.e., beginning of life of the xenon bulb). However, the arc can move (due to cathode degradation) in excess of about 250 microns during the first 200 hours of operation in a typical illumination system. Therefore, if the xenon bulb is aligned for maximum fiber throughput at zero hours, the arc movement (which can result in much of the arc image moving outside of the fiber core area) combined with the decrease in arc peak luminance will result in an appreciable drop in fiber throughput, and hence in an appreciable drop in illumination at the surgical site. One way of solving this problem in prior art ophthalmic illumination systems is to increase the diameter of the proximal end of the optical fiber core. However, increasing the diameter of the optical fiber has several disadvantages. One disadvantage is that the increased fiber diameter results in a stiffer optical fiber, which is not as easy to manipulate in an operating environment. Further, a larger diameter fiber is more expensive because more fiber material is used per unit length of optical fiber. Even further, a larger diameter fiber may be greater than that allowed by the probe requirements. For example, a 20 gauge ophthalmic illuminator probe (0.355 inch cannula outer diameter) can accommodate a maximum diameter of the fiber core and cladding of 0.0295 inches. Further still, undesired dissipation of the light from the light source can result from allowing a tightly focused arc image to expand into a larger diameter beam as defined by the larger diameter fiber. Once this light concentration is lost, it cannot be recaptured. If the optical fiber tapers to a smaller diameter downstream from its proximal end, the ability of the light to efficiently transmit through the tapered fiber will depend on the concentration of the light prior to the start of the fiber taper. If the arc image is allowed to spread spatially and dissipate its light concentration, the light will transmit less efficiently into the tapered fiber portion. Therefore, a need exists for a method and system for enhancing the useful lifetime of an ophthalmic illumination system that can reduce or eliminate the problems of prior art ophthalmic illumination systems discussed above. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The embodiments of the method and system for enhancing the useful lifetime of an ophthalmic illumination system of this invention substantially meet these needs and others. One embodiment of the present invention comprises an ophthalmic illuminator comprising: an illumination source, wherein the illumination source produces an arc; a lens, such as a condensing lens, for focusing light produced by the illumination source arc; and an optical fiber for carrying the focused light to a surgical site, such as an eye. The illumination source is positioned offset from a longitudinal axis of the optical fiber to compensate for shifting of the illumination source arc over time. The offset position can be such that the illumination source is positioned in a vertically offset position from the longitudinal axis of the optical fiber. The longitudinal axis corresponds to the optical path axis of the optical fiber. The ophthalmic illuminator can further comprise a reflector for reflecting the light produced by the illumination source arc, wherein the reflector is positioned offset from the illumination source to decrease the rate of erosion of an illumination source cathode. The ophthalmic illuminator can be a high brightness illuminator and the illumination source can be a xenon lamp. The ophthalmic illuminator can also comprise a connector for aligning the light exiting the focusing lens with the optical fiber; a hand piece carrying the optical fiber, the hand piece capable of being manipulated in a hand; and a probe for carrying the optical fiber into the surgical site. The connector can be attached (and detached) to a port for aligning the light exiting the focusing lens with the optical fiber Other embodiments of this present invention can include a method for enhancing the useful lifetime of an ophthalmic illuminator by offsetting a xenon lamp arc in accordance with the teachings of this invention. Embodiments of this invention can be implemented within a surgical machine or system for use in ophthalmic or other surgery. In particular, it is contemplated that the method and system for enhancing the useful lifetime of an ophthalmic illumination system of this invention can be implemented in, or incorporated into, any ophthalmic illumination system in which it is desirable to efficiently couple a xenon light source optical beam to a small diameter optical fiber. Other uses for the method and system of this invention will be apparent to those having skill in the art.",

    "abstract": "Now in accordance with the present invention a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone, (LHRH) antagonist has been discovered which effectively reduces the amount of luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland. The LHRH antagonist of the present invention reduces the level of circulating estrogen, progesterone and testosterone in mammals which are treated with a therapeutically effective dose of said antagonist. The preferred embodiment of the LHRH antagonist peptide of the present invention is characterized by the following formula: SEQ ID NO.: #1 wherein the Alanine residue at SEQUENCE position 1 is N-acetyl-D-3-(2-naphthyl)-Ala; the Phenylalanine residue at SEQUENCE position 2 is D-3-(4-chlorophenyl)-alanine; the Alanine residue at SEQUENCE position 3 is D-3(3-pyridyl)-Ala; the Lysine residue at Sequence position 6 is D-6-carbamoyl lysine; the Lysine residue at SEQUENCE position number 8 is Nε-isopropyl-Lys; and the Alanine residue at SEQUENCE position 10 is D-Ala-NH 2 . An alternative embodiment of the present invention is characterized by the following formula: SEQ ID NO.: 2 wherein the Alanine residue at SEQUENCE position 1 is N-acetyl-D-3-(2-naphthyl)-Ala; the Phenylalanine residue at SEQUENCE position 2 is D-3-(4-chlorophenyl)alanine; the Alanine residue at SEQUENCE position 3 is D-3(3-pyridyl)-Ala; the Lysine residue at Sequence position 6 is D-6-carbamoyl lysine; the Lysine residue at SEQUENCE position number 8 is Nε-isopropyl-Lys; and the Proline residue at SEQUENCE position 9 is Pro-NHCH 2  CH 3 . In another embodiment of the present invention a method for reducing circulating levels of estrogen, progesterone and testosterone is provided wherein an LHRH antagonist according to the present invention is administered to a subject mammal at a therapeutically effective dosage so as to reduce said levels. As is well known in the art, the therapeutically effective dosage for any given hormone antagonist is dependent on various factors identified with each subject to be treated such as subject weight, age, metabolic rate and plasma levels of gonadotropic hormones. However, the human dosage for the LHRH antagonists of the present invention generally ranges between about 0.1 and 1.0 mg/day in order to achieve a castration level of estradiol or testosterone. The LHRH antagonist peptides of the present invention may be utilized as an alternative to ablation treatment in treating disease of estrogen and androgen responsive tissue which is ordinarily responsive to reduction of plasma levels of these hormones. When utilized for this purpose, individual subjects should be titrated to ablation levels of plasma testosterone or estrogen (estradiol). As discussed above, a daily dosage of from about 0.1 to 1.0 mg is used to achieve the required castration level. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The LHRH antagonist peptides of the present invention may be utilized in the treatment of prostatic cancer. The antagonist is titrated to a dosage required to simulate castration levels in order to substantially reduce the circulating androgen level. The peptides of the present invention may be utilized alone, or in combination with anti-androgens such as flutamide, cyproterone acetate, and ketoconazole. These anti-androgen preparations are required where significant androgen production occurs in the adrenal gland. Since adrenal production of androgens are not affected by LHRH anti-androgens may be combined with the peptides of the present invention in order to block androgen activity from adrenal origin. The LHRH antagonist peptides of the present invention may be used as an alternative to ovariectomy in the palliative treatment of breast cancer of premenopausal women. Because of the relatively low level of estrogen in post menopausal women, and in women who have undergone ovariectomies, any reduction of this hormone through utilization of the LHRH antagonist peptide of the present invention would be of limited value. The peptides of the present invention must be titrated so as to achieve profound pituitary and gonadal suppression. Such suppression occurs, as discussed above, with a daily average dosage range of about 0.1 to 1.0 mg/day. The peptides of the present invention may be utilized in the treatment of endometriosis; the ectopic occurrence of endometrial tissue generally within the abdominal cavity. By suppressing gonadal steroid secretion, growth of endometrial tissue decreases to the level of atrophy, thus effectively reducing endometrial tissue island formation within the myometrium or in the pelvic cavity outside the uterus. Thus an alternative to anterior pituitary drugs such as Danazol (pregna-2, 4-dien-20-yno[2,3d]isoxazol-17-ol), and surgical excisions of implants through laparoscopy, in a method of treating endometriosis is provided wherein cardiovascular side effects and mild androgenic effects associated with such drugs are avoided, and the need for surgical excision is either eliminated or reduced. The LHRH antagonist peptides of the present invention additionally provide a method for treating uterine leiomyoma in pre-menopausal women. By titrating patient estrogen levels to those levels found in post menopausal women, control of tumor growth, and regression is possible. Thus the peptides of the present invention provide an alternative to the only known (non-surgical) existing medical treatment of uterine leiomyoma; LHRH agonist therapy. Complete anterior pituitary suppression is required in order to ensure effective treatment of uterine leiomyoma. The LHRH antagonist peptides of the present invention provide a method for treating polycystic ovarian disease. The increased androgen secretion associated with this disease may be associated with either ovarian or adrenal secretion. Since adrenal secretion is not responsive to variations in gonadotropic hormone levels, the LHRH antagonist of the present invention may alternatively be used as a diagnostic tool in differentiating the source of elevated plasma levels of androgen. By administering a castration level of the peptides of the present invention to a subject with polycystic ovarian disease, the level of androgen will profoundly decrease if ovarian tissue (LH-responsive tissue) is responsible for the unusually high levels of androgen. If, on the other hand, no substantial decrease in androgen level is detected, it is the adrenal gland which is responsible for the elevated androgen levels. If the ovarian tissue is responsible for elevated levels of androgen, the LHRH antagonist peptide of the present invention may be utilized, (at a castration level), in order to control polycystic disease and associated ache and hirsutism. LHRH antagonist peptides of the present invention may be prepared utilizing automated peptide synthesis techniques well known to the art. The following examples disclose two methods utilizing standard techniques, however, one skilled in the art may readily adapt other techniques to different synthesizers.",

    "abstract": "The state of anesthesia is achieved by administering a combination of various anesthetic agents that render patients unconscious and insensitive to the trauma of surgery, while providing surgeons with a quiet surgical field. The concept of anesthesia, in the context of modern practice of balanced anesthesia, is a multi-component entity comprising hypnosis, analgesia and muscle relaxation. Thus the term “depth of anesthesia”, or “anesthetic depth”, is relevant for each of these components measured separately. All general anesthetics lead to the loss of consciousness. At higher doses they also provide analgesia and muscle relaxation—two clinical end-points that can be independently achieved by analgesics and muscle relaxants. However, these drugs do not provide unconsciousness at clinical concentrations. Hence, although the mechanisms of anesthesia are still largely unknown, it is believed that hypnosis—i.e. drug-induced loss of consciousness and amnesia—is one of its major components. Traditionally, anesthesiologists titrate drugs by assessing the anesthetic/hypnotic state of a patient based on observations of various clinical signs and their changes (such as blood pressure, heart rate, pupil dilatation, sweating, lacrimation, movement etc.). However, these signs may not always be readily available, and furthermore, may be unreliable. The need for a monitor of hypnosis is especially strengthened by the use of neuromuscular blockade agents in modern clinical practice. It is therefore possible for a patient to be aware of the surgery, yet unable to communicate his or her awareness by movement to the anesthesiologist. Therefore, a monitor of hypnosis/consciousness will provide anesthesiologists with a guide for the precise titration of anesthetic drugs, thus avoiding both overdosing and intraoperative awareness. It is expected that a better titration will result in fewer side effects, faster discharge from intensive care unit, and long term savings in terms of the drug quantities administered during surgeries. All hypnotic drugs depress the Central Nervous System (CNS). Therefore it is natural to assume that Electroencephalographic (EEG) changes in the brain&#39;s electrical activity carry relevant information about drug effects on the brain. Thus, the hypnotic state of a patient could, theoretically at least, be quantified by observing variations in EEG waveforms. Numerous studies have explored this field since the first observation of the effect of narcotics or general depressant drugs on the EEG in the late 1930&#39;s. However, the interpretation of the unprocessed or raw EEG signal is very complex, time consuming and requires an experienced specialist. Therefore, many efforts have been put into deriving EEG-based indices that correlate with the hypnotic state of a patient. A number of inventions related to monitoring of anesthesia using electroencephalographic signals have already been disclosed. In John, U.S. Pat. No. 4,557,270 issued Dec. 10, 1985 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,699,808 issued Dec. 23, 1997, systems monitoring patients in postoperative care units are disclosed. These prior art systems are based on Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials (BAER) and Brainstem Somatosensory Evoked Potentials (BSER) which are extracted from the EEG signals after an auditory or somatosensory stimulus has been delivered to the patient. The use of such signals suffers from a rather cumbersome setup and the heavy preprocessing of the EEG in order to extract the small evoked signals of interest from the background EEG. These systems also acquired other physiological quantities such as temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, etc. Another invention using evoked potentials is described in John, U.S. Pat. No. 6,067,467 issued May 23, 2000. This invention further relies on the relative power in the theta band from 3.5 Hz to 7.5 Hz, which is used as an indication of blood flow and pain. A scoring algorithm is used to classify the patient&#39;s hypnotic state. The preferred embodiment for this invention is the closed-loop control of anesthetics drugs. A similar concept of closed-loop anesthesia using auditory evoked potentials is disclosed by Mantzaridis et al., international publication number WO 98/10701 published Mar. 19, 1998. The use of time domain methods and frequency analysis to derive a number of parameters from spontaneous EEG has been thoroughly investigated. In Kangas, U.S. Pat. No. 5,775,330 issued Jul. 7, 1998, the inventor discloses such a technique to classify hypnotic states during clinical anesthesia. This prior art system further relies on a neural network to reach a single univariate descriptor. Maynard, U.S. Pat. No. 5,816,247 issued Oct. 6, 1998, also uses a similar analysis and a neural network for the classification of sleep states. Finally, in Schultz, U.S. Pat. No. 6,011,990 issued Jan. 4, 2000, an autoregressive model of the EEG supplements the spectral analysis. A multivariate classification function is further used to generate an appropriate index representative of the patient&#39;s hypnotic state. Ennen, U.S. Pat. No. 6,317,627 issued Nov. 13, 2001, also uses spectral analysis. However, the disclosed invention uses additional observers that are further combined into a univariate index using component analysis. Higher order spectral analysis has generated interest since the early 1990&#39;s. Chamoun, U.S. Pat. No. 5,320,109 issued June, 1994, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,458,117 issued Oct. 17, 1995, uses bispectral analysis combined with classical spectral analysis to derive an index of hypnosis. This invention&#39;s output is a weighted sum of different parameters that are mainly derived using spectral and higher order spectral analysis. In Merilainen, WO 01/24691 published Sep. 30, 2000, the inventor discloses a system that measures the patient&#39;s brain activity by means of a light directed towards the patient&#39;s forehead. The light is filtered by the patient&#39;s tissues and the analysis of the resulting optical signal gives an indication of the patient&#39;s cerebral state. Finally, in Vierto-Oja, WO 02/32305 published Apr. 25, 2002, the inventor uses the entropy of patients&#39; EEG to ascertain their cerebral state. In one embodiment, the inventor combines a parameter obtained from spectral analysis of the Electromyogram (EMG) to provide a fast indication of change of the patient&#39;s state. While spectral and higher order spectral analysis are the key techniques used in the prior art to provide an accurate and reliable index of hypnosis, clinical practice has shown that some delay exists between the change of the patient&#39;s anesthetic state and the changes in the indices that are available today. Although the disclosed techniques of Chamoun and Ennen are already being used with success in the operating room, an index reacting more quickly to changes in a patient&#39;s state is desirable. This is particularly true in the context of closed-loop anesthesia where a fast index will increase the stability of the system, hence allowing for better performance. Spectral and high order spectral analyses are particularly suited for signals with repetitive patterns. However, the electroencephalogram is typically a noise-like signal that does not exhibit observable patterns. The use of auditory or somatosensory evoked potentials has also been thoroughly investigated by the research community. These potentials are particular patterns embedded in the electroencephalogram itself, and resulting from the external excitation of sensory functions. These patterns are clearly different whether the sensory information can be processed by cognitive functions (e.g., awake patient) or not (e.g., anesthetized patients). However, the analysis of these signals suffers from poor signal to noise ratio. Hence, considerable averaging is necessary to extract these potentials, which makes this technique unreliable in detecting rapid changes in patients&#39; state. Wavelets have generated great interest in the biomedical field. Their very low computational complexity associated with excellent joint time-frequency resolution properties makes them particularly well suited for the analysis of time-varying, non-stationary signals such as the EEG. Wavelets have been successfully used as a diagnostic tool to capture small-scale transients and events within the EEG, as well as to extract various features and waveform patterns from the EEG. Also, wavelets have been used in pre-processing of the EEG, when used as input signal to a neural network, and for the de-noising and compression of EEG data. However, no prior patent addresses the use of wavelet analysis in the context of spontaneous EEG analysis and diagnosing for clinical anesthesia. Gillberg, international publication no. WO 00/69517, published Nov. 23, 2000 proposes the analysis of heart rhythms using wavelet analysis applied to electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. The digitized signals are analyzed by transforming them into wavelet coefficients by a wavelet transform. The higher amplitude coefficients are identified, selected and compared with pre-defined sets of wavelet coefficients, which are derived from signals of heart rhythms of known type. This method is used to discriminate normal from abnormal rhythms. The object of the present invention is the use of wavelet analysis to extract a univariate feature from a spontaneous EEG signal that correlates to the patient&#39;s hypnotic state (referred to throughout this patent as WAVelet index), hence avoiding the complex and time consuming discriminant analysis and/or neural network training done in previous work. Furthermore, previous systems are characterized by a significant time delay between the patient&#39;s true hypnotic state and the computed indices. This time delay is either the result of the analysis technique itself—such as in spectral and higher order spectral analysis—or the consequence of the large averaging needed in case of evoked potential analysis. Therefore, it is the object of the present invention to significantly reduce this time delay by using a different analysis technique applied to spontaneous EEG. This makes of the WAV a more precise feedback quantity for the monitoring, and/or manual/automatic control of anesthesia.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to hospital/clinical layouts, and more particularly, to the layout, structure and usage of intervention/operating rooms (OR), and related intubation, extubation and patient rooms. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Currently, a patient at a hospital or medical clinic is moved from location to location numerous times in order for a procedure to be completed. Also, typically, OR and intervention rooms and equipment used therein are underutilized in most hospitals and medical facilities, thereby increasing the cost of procedures. In addition, OR/intervention rooms are typically so crowded with equipment, lighting fixtures, booms, monitors, utility columns or booms, hoses, tubes and lines, that it is difficult for OR/intervention room personnel to actually move about efficiently. Also, such equipment can impair the vision of OR/intervention room personnel and impede laminar air flow from an overhead source, over the patient, and then out of the OR/intervention room. Such lighting fixture booms, equipment booms, etc., often set up air eddies or dead spaces. Also, fixtures, equipment, etc., can collect dust particles that can then be blown into the surgical field within the laminar air flow column at the surgical/intervention site thus compromised the laminar air flow system&#39;s purpose of reducing surgical/intervention wound infections. In addition, an extensive period of time is required to clean and prepare an OR/intervention room after a procedure has been completed. The room is manually cleaned, and the soiled equipment, diagnostics, linen, etc., must be removed manually from the room and new supplies, equipment, etc., delivered to the room and set up. This takes time, which reduces throughput and the number of cases per day. The cost of the personnel for carrying out these tasks is not insignificant. The present invention seeks to address the foregoing drawbacks of existing OR/intervention room structures and procedures. The present invention strives to reduce the number of patient moves, enhance patient safety and provide flexibility and adaptability of the OR/intervention room for future advances in patient care. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One aspect of the present invention pertains to a plurality of adjacent OR/intervention rooms for performing medical procedures where each room comprises a surgical/intervention zone of a pre-determined area, generally surrounding the location in which the patient is positioned. The surgical/intervention zone is substantially free of monitors, displays, mountings for monitors and displays, overhead utility sources and outlets, equipment booms and mountings, equipment and supply cabinet mountings, as well as equipment, instrument and supply table mountings. The OR/intervention rooms also include an adjustable lighting system incorporated into the ceiling of the room to provide substantially unobstructed light to the surgical/intervention zone. In addition, a ventilation system provides unimpeded laminar flow of air from the ceiling through the surgical/intervention zone. In an aspect of the present disclosure, the OR/intervention room is constructed with a drop-down ceiling structure that defines a surgery/intervention zone around the patient that is free from articulating arms from monitors, from lighting fixtures, from equipment, and also free from hose drops and utility columns from the ceiling, or other electrical, data, medical gas, vacuum, or evacuation lines, tubes, or cords. The drop-down ceiling can be of a selected size and ideally from about 7 to 8 feet above the floor to establish an unobstructed, sterile zone for the surgery/intervention room. In a further aspect of the present invention, multiple light sources are recessed in the ceiling of the OR/intervention room and are carried by movable mounting systems that may be aimed, focused, or otherwise controlled as desired by the OR/intervention room personnel. The lighting system may be controlled by microchips mountable on gloves, wristbands, or other articles worn by OR/intervention room personnel, or may be controlled by radio frequency identification tags located on, or incorporated into, instruments used by the OR/intervention room personnel, or may be activated by audio commands. In another aspect of the present invention, a plurality of large, high resolution audio/video monitors are positioned outside of the intervention zone. Such monitors are configured to provide patient physiological information and digital images, provide communications within and outside of the OR/intervention room, and provide high resolution image guidance for intervention procedures. The content of the monitors may be controlled by a voice-actuated system. In another aspect of the present invention, movable imaging equipment is shared among the OR/intervention rooms. In this regard, a transportation system is provided for transporting the moving of the mobile imaging equipment among the OR/intervention rooms. Such mobile imaging equipment may include, for example, CT scanners and MRI devices. In addition, the transportation system may include an overhead rail system incorporated into the ceilings of the OR/intervention rooms. The present invention further comprises intubation rooms adjacent the OR/intervention rooms. The intubation rooms are configured and equipped to prepare patients for procedures to occur in the OR/intervention rooms. Such preparation can take place while the OR/intervention room is being prepared. The present invention also contemplates extubation rooms located adjacent the OR/intervention rooms. The extubation rooms are configured and equipped to post-intervention, awaken, and extubate patients. The OR/intervention room may be cleaned and readied for the next case while the patient would otherwise be awakening in the room. In accordance with a further aspect of the present invention, the foregoing OR/intervention rooms, intubation rooms and extubation rooms are part of a general hospital layout which also includes a plurality of universal patient rooms located adjacent the OR/intervention rooms. Such universal patient rooms are configured and equipped to admit patients for intervention, prepare patients for intervention, allow patients to recover post-intervention, and discharge patients post-recovery. Such universal patient rooms are adaptable to provide high-level intensive care post-intervention, as well as to function at a lower level in the manner of a traditional patient room, for example, for patient recovery and discharge after relatively minor or routine surgery. As a further aspect of the present invention, the hospital layout may also include procedural rooms located adjacent the OR/intervention rooms. Such procedural rooms are configured and equipped to share imaging equipment with the OR/intervention rooms. Regular imaging procedures can be carried out at high volume in the procedural rooms. As a consequence, the expensive imaging equipment may be more efficiently utilized than is currently the case. A further aspect of the present invention includes a novel surgical table, including an articulating platform, pedestal supporting the platform, and a floor-engaging base. The surgical table includes a connection system for connecting the base to a connector hub integrated into the floor of the OR/intervention room, thereby connecting the surgical table to utility outlets for medical gases, electricity, data lines, and cable connectors. In addition, the surgical table includes arm structures at the foot and head of the table, each having outlets or connections for the aforementioned utilities. Such arms are movable between an ergonomically correct position for connection to the utilities of gases, electricity, data, etc., and then movable to a position below the top surface of the table platform so as to be retracted out of the way. The outlet arms at the head or foot of the table permit the sterile surgical drape over the sides of the table to be undisturbed during a procedure. In a further aspect of the present invention, an anesthesia machine is detachably dockable to the base of the surgical table. The anesthesia machine has a connection system for connecting the anesthesia machine to the connector hub integrated into the floor of the OR/intervention room and also for connecting the anesthesia machine to the surgical table for utilities, communications, control cables, etc. A control system for controlling the anesthesia machine may be at a remote location so that several patients may be monitored at the same time.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to elevated hunting or observation stands. More particularly, the present invention relates to hunting stands, primarily for use with trees, that transport the user to a desired elevation above ground. Known prior art stands are classified in United States Patent Class 182, Subclasses 133, 135-137, 141, and 187-188. 2. Description of the Related Art Hunters have long recognized and appreciated the many advantages gained by hunting from elevated positions, especially with modern tree stands. Stands that have been properly designed and correctly deployed comfortably provide a safe, seated position at an elevation that is ideal for inconspicuously observing and bagging game animals. An elevated position amplifies the hunter&#39;s field of view, enlarging the potential target area. Numerous diverse tree stands exist in the art. Large, relatively heavy permanent stands are well known. When properly built they can provide a sheltered hunting position well above ground offering superb visibility about a 360 degree radius. Permanent stands have several advantages. For example, they can comfortably accommodate more than one hunter, and they are spacious enough to move about. Some permanent stands have generous storage space, and they may even have electricity and various appliances. However, permanent stands are difficult and time consuming to erect, and as a practical matter, they cannot be moved between hunting locations without significant time-consuming effort. On the other hand, portable tree stands are lightweight, relatively compact, and readily transportable. They can easily be carried into the woods for subsequent erection and use, and when a different hunting location is preferred, they readily disassemble for rapid deployment elsewhere. Portable stands typically comprise a seat supported upon a frame that is adapted to be semi-permanently attached to a tree. In typical “climber” designs, a compound frame has a pair of hinged members that that encircle the tree trunk. The frame elements are intermittently moved into and out of binding contact with the tree truck in response to user movement, and upward movement is enabled. As one fame element is loosened, it can be lifted vertically, while the other frame element temporarily remains in binding contact with the tree trunk. Non-climbing tree stands often have seats supported above ground by one or more vertical ladder elements that elevate the frame. The seat, which may be swiveled for limited rotation so that a large ground radius may be conveniently observed, provides a comfortable and stable rest for the hunter. The frame may be anchored to the tree above ground by suitable teeth or pointed flanges that are forcibly locked into engagement with the tree truck by an encircling chain or rope that is tightened by a clamp or turnbuckle. Many portable designs are deployed at a selectable elevation established by the number and length of the ladder elements used by the stand. Once fastened in position, the seat cannot be easily moved vertically. In such designs the hunter gains access to the elevated seat by carefully ascending the ladder. With climbing stands, on the other hand, the hunter may seat himself within the stand at ground level, and thereafter physically manipulate the stand to gradually climb the tree. Examples of manually-operated, climbing tree stands are provided by U.S. Pat. No. 3,727,723 issued Apr. 17, 1973, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,647,454 issued Jul. 15, 1997. Other approaches to elevating tree stands exist. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,568,797 issued Mar. 9, 1971 discloses a stand with a collapsible seat housed within a frame moved by a hand-cranked pulley system. When the stand is attached to a tree it can be manually raised to the desired elevation with the pulley system. Similar crank-operated tree stand systems are seen in U.S. Pat. No. 3,731,762 issued May 8, 1973, U.S. Pat. No. 4,347,913 issued Sep. 7, 1982, U.S. Pat. No. 4,602,698 issued Jul. 29, 1986, U.S. Pat. No. 4,694,934 issued Sep. 22, 1987, and U.S. Pat. No. 5,009,284 issued Apr. 23, 1991. A variation of the cable-driven theme is seen in U.S. Pat. No. 6,079,517 issued Jun. 27, 2000, showing a power driven tree stand that combines a winch with wheels that contact the tree truck. A similar cable-elevated, wheeled carriage is seen in the powered deer stand depicted in U.S. Pat. Application No. 2003/0178251 published Sep. 25, 2003. Motorized or power-driven tree stands are also known in the art. Since many hunters are elderly or physically handicapped or otherwise physically incapacitated, powered deer stands have recognized advantages. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,811,803 issued Mar. 14, 1989 illustrates a self-propelled deer stand that elevates hunters above the ground. A pivoted chassis rotates to a vertical position when the structure is raised off the ground. The deer stand uses a motor-powered winch and a cable assembly that elevates it. However, there is a need or a power-driven hunting stand that avoids the use of cables or overhead chains or hoists. Such designs are cumbersome and difficult to deploy, especially for handicapped or elderly hunters. When installed carelessly or inadequately, they tend to be unstable. Often cable-driven designs require deployment, at least in part, upon an overhead branch, which can be difficult to reach, particularly when mounting the tree stand on pine trees. Further, cable-driven power stands do not adequately brace themselves against the tree trunk, increasing the risk of falling or slipping. Known systems involving wheels that contact the tree trunk are unstable and they tend to slip. Insufficient traction is developed by the wheels that rub against the external tree trunk. Furthermore, there is a need for a power driven deer stand that is essentially portable. While some portable designs are quite rugged despite their light weight, one common problem with so-called portable stands is that they can be relatively flimsy and unstable. On the other hand, ruggedized, heavy duty designs made of bulky metal parts tend to be heavy and cumbersome. However, it is important to realize that the disadvantages associated with heavier tree stands are outweighed by their dexterity. In the past, for example, hunters often preferred lightweight deer stands that could be easily carried in a backpack and quickly deployed after a single trip into the woods. Thus lightweight climbing stands have been popular. However, while a deer stand that can be carried into the woods in a single trip has obvious advantages, many hunters no longer demand such simplicity. Larger, heavier “portable” stands that can be carried by one or more hunters, or by a single hunter who makes separate trips, have significant advantages. What is important with heavier “portable” designs is that the parts, once transported, fit together easily on the job site for quick erection, and that the assembled unit operates safely and reliably. In this regard, it should be appreciated that a heavy-duty “portable” stand may be as stable a hunting platform as the typical elevated “permanent” stand. The number of parts required to assemble the stand, or the number of trips into the woods carrying parts, is not critical to many users. It is not uncommon these days that heavier “portable” tree stands be delivered to the hunting site in an all-terrain vehicle or pickup truck, avoiding the necessity for time consuming trips where the hunter manually carries the stand&#39;s parts. Usually such stands are deployed by a group of hunters several days before the hunting season, so portability, light weight and speed of erection are features that are gradually diminishing in importance. What is important to many hunters is that the stand be easy to climb. Thus a powered stand that transports the hunter to the desired elevated hunting position is desirable. Typical climbing stands that are operated manually are of no value to handicapped or elderly hunters. If a heavy duty “portable” stand that is rugged and powered can elevate the hunter automatically to an elevated position, the disadvantages associated with increased weight will be forgotten and excused. Further, such a system must offer a stable and safe support once deployed, and ease of both ingress and egress must be facilitated. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention provides a motorized, elevating device that safely and reliably elevates a user to a desired vertical elevation along an elongated, cylindrical object such as a pole. Preferably the device functions as a deer stand, and it is deployed within the woods against a selected tree. My invention provides a power means to elevate the hunter to a desired position vertically above ground. The motorized, climbing stand is ideal for hunting. An elongated, track constructed in the field from multiple, axially aligned sections, is attached to a tree trunk by suitable clamps or bands. A carriage with a comfortable seat is coupled to a shuttle assembly that engages the track. The shuttle assembly mounts a motor and a driven gear that engages the track, enabling the carriage to move vertically upwardly or downwardly in response to motor operation.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates generally to a treatment for scoliosis and more specifically to the instruments, implants, distracting trial spacers, and surgical methodology used in the treatment and correction of scoliosis. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The bones and connective tissue of an adult human spinal column consists of more than 20 discrete bones. These more than 20 bones are anatomically categorized as being members of one of four classifications: cervical, thoracic, lumbar, or sacral. They are coupled sequentially to one another by tri-joint complexes that consist of an anterior intervertebral disc and the two posterior facet joints. The anterior intervertebral discs of adjacent bones are cushioning cartilage spacers. The spinal column of bones is highly complex in that it includes these 20 bones coupled to one another (and others), and it houses and protects critical elements of the nervous system having innumerable peripheral nerves and circulatory bodies in close proximity. In spite of these complications, the spine is a highly flexible structure, capable of a high degree of curvature and twist in nearly every direction. Genetic, congenital and/or developmental irregularities are the principle causes that can result in spinal pathologies in which the natural curvature of the spine lost. Scoliosis is a very common one of these types of irregularities, resulting in a sequential misalignment of the bones and intervertebral discs of the spine. Major causes of scoliosis are idiopathic (i.e., unknown cause), congenital developmental anomalies and neuromuscular disorders such as cerebral palsy. The misalignment usually manifests itself in an asymmetry of the vertebral bodies, such that, over a sequence of spinal bones, the spine twists and/or bends to one side. In severe cases, neurological impairment and/or physiological disability may result. The present surgical technique for treating scoliosis (as well as other spinal conditions) includes the implantation of a plurality of hooks and/or screws into the spinal bones, connecting rods to these elements, physically bracing the bones into the desired positions, and permitting the bones to fuse across the entire assembly. This immobilization often requires anterior plates, rods and screws and posterior rods, hooks and/or screws. Alternatively, spacer elements are positioned between the sequential bones, which spacers are often designed to permit fusion of the bone into the matrix of the spacer from either end, hastening the necessary rigidity of the developing bone structure. Spacers allow bone fusion to grow into or around them. There are two classes of intervertebral spacers: horizontal cages such as the BAK™ and Ray cages, as described and set forth in exemplary U.S. Pat. No. 5,015,247 to Michelson and U.S. Pat. No. 5,026,373 to Ray et al., respectively, and vertical cages such the Harms cages, as described and set forth in exemplary U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,305. Similar techniques have been employed in other spinal infirmities, including collapsed disc spaces (failure of the intervertebral disc), traumatic fractures, and other degenerative disorders. While the present invention has many applications, such applications include the treatment of any spinal disorder in which the space between vertebral bones needs to be surgically separated (the bones distracted), realigned and then fused to one another. A variety of systems have been disclosed in the art which achieve immobilization and/or fusion of adjacent bones by implanting artificial assemblies in or on the spinal column. The region of the back that needs to be immobilized, as well as the individual variations in anatomy, determine the appropriate surgical protocol and implantation assembly. With respect to the failure of the intervertebral disc, and the insertion of implants and/or height restorative devices, several methods and devices have been disclosed in the prior art. Restoring the appropriate height and orientation of the vertebral bones and the intervertebral space is the first step in the surgical strategy for correcting this condition. Once this is achieved, one class of surgical implantation procedures involves positioning a device into the intervening space. This may be done through a posterior approach, a lateral approach, or an anterior approach. Various implant devices for this purpose include femoral ring allograft, cylindrical metallic devices (i.e., cages), and metal mesh structures that may be filled with suitable bone graft materials. Some of these implant devices are only suitable for one direction of approach to the spine. All of these devices, however, are provided with the intention that the adjacent bones will, once restored to their appropriate alignment and separation, then grow together across the space and fuse together (or at least fuse into the device implanted between the bones). Most recently, the development of non-fusion implant devices, which purport to permit continued natural movement in the tri-joint complex have provided great promise. The instrumentation and methods for the implantation of these non-fusion devices, as well as the implantation of the fusion devices catalogued previously, therefore should integrate the functions of restoring proper anatomical spacing and easy insertion of the selected device into the formed volume. It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a new and novel treatment for scoliosis, as well as for the treatment of spinal pathologies in general. It is, correspondingly, another object of the present invention to provide an intervertebral distraction trial tool which more accurately and easily separates collapsed intervertebral spaces. It is further an object of the present invention to provide an intervertebral distraction trial tool which more can be used to correct scoliosis and/or restore normal alignment to the spine. It is further an object of the present invention to provide an instrument that proficiently and simply manages the insertion, rotation, and removal of the intervertebral distraction trial tools. It is further an object of the present invention to provide an implantable spacer device that permits more anatomically appropriate and rapidly osteogenic fusion across the intervertebral space. Other objects of the present invention not explicitly stated will be set forth and will be more clearly understood in conjunction with the descriptions of the preferred embodiments disclosed hereafter. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a method of treatment of scoliosis and other spinal disorders. This method of treatment further includes several new and novel instruments, implantable trial distraction elements, and intervertebral spacer implants. Inasmuch as the description of the new and novel method cannot be complete without a description of each of these integral members, the following includes ample explanation of these elements as well as description of the surgical techniques. First, the patient spine is exposed through an anterior approach (i.e., the surgeon creates an access hole which permits direct interaction with the anterior and/or anterio-lateral portion of the intervertebral bodies). In the case of scoliosis, as well as in other disorders in which the intervertebral space requires distraction and/or repositioning, the surgeon removes the intervertebral disc material, usually leaving some portion of the annulus (the cylindrical weave of fibrous tissue which normally surrounds and constrains the softer cartilage cushion of the disc material). The surgeon then, in succession, inserts a series of intervertebral trial spacers of defined width. Each of the series of spacers is of a progressively wider thickness, resulting in the continual widening of the space until restoration of the proper disc height has been achieved. Proper disc height restoration is determined by surgical experience, and by observation of the annulus. (Often, the tightening of the annulus indicates that the proper disc height has been reached, inasmuch as the annulus is much less likely to be distorted by the same disruption that caused the intervertebral disc to collapse in the first place.)",

    "abstract": "In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a shower shelf structure and storage unit which is simple, low in cost, which fits readily over the shower arm and when in place does not slide off of the arm nor rotate about the arm. As a result articles placed on the shelf unit remain in place and do not spill off. More specifically, the shelf structure in accordance with the present invention is formed from a coated wire. A frame is formed from a pair of spaced apart parallel legs which taper toward each other at their upper end to define an inverted generally U-shaped gripping or retaining portion. The configuration of the gripping portion retains the rack on the shower arm against slippage and rotation when the rack is in place. A plurality of shelves and retaining guard rails also made of coated wire extend between the vertical legs of the rack. The shelves are constructed with a peripheral raised edge to keep articles such as soap on the shelves from slipping off of the shelves. The shelves being constructed of spaced apart coated wires are not solid, and therefore, water is not retained in the shelf and the articles supported thereby have an opportunity to dry between use of the shower. The lower extremities of the shelf structure legs may be bent at about a 90 degree angle to define hooks for holding appropriates articles such as brushes, washcloths and caps of the type that are more easily hung from a hook as distinguished from beomg supported on a shelf itself. In accordance with one aspect of the invention, the stability provided by the design of the present invention allows the shelf to be constructed wider than normally possible since the antislip capabilities of the shelf of the present invention is so effective that even on wider shelves off-center loads do not result in the shelf to sliding or tilting. In conjunction with extra-wide shelf structure, the shelf units themselves are designed to provide extra rigidity which is, of course, more desirable as the shelf is built wider. Thus the shower shelf unit and support structure of the present invention is constructed from a simple basic material, a coated rigid wire, is capable of being supported on the shower arm in a fixed position without rotation or slippage and for that reason can be built wider to provide greater capacity. At the same time the design of the shelf unit retains desired rigidity. The shelvs are constructed with a peripheral raised edge to inhibit articles from falling off of the shelves and keep the articles stored where they are supposed to be. The resulting safe and stable shelving unit is well-suited to be used in shower stalls and baths.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to heterocycle derivatives that are inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC). Compounds of the present invention are useful for treating disorders that are ameliorated by inhibition of HDAC, in particular genetic disorders, including hemoglobinopathies. Hemoglobinopathies are genetic defects characterized by abnormal structure or underproduction of the normal globin proteins of the hemoglobin molecule (Hb). The major hemoglobinopathies include sickle cell diseases and several forms of thalassemias. Sickle cell anemia results from a missense mutation at the 6 th  aminoacid of the beta-globin chain. The resulting sickle Hb (HbS) forms insoluble polymers within the cytosol upon deoxygenation, with subsequent deformation of the red blood cells and vaso-occlusion. Thalassemias may be traced to numerous genetic mutations that result in either loss or reduced expression of alpha or beta-globin, whereas beta-thalassemias are more common. In particular, compounds of the invention are useful for treating β-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In eukaryotic cells the orderly packaging of DNA in the nucleus plays an important role in the regulation of gene transcription. Nuclear DNA is ordered in a compact complex called chromatin. The core of the complex is an octamer of highly conserved basic proteins called histones. Two each of histones H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 associate and DNA winds around the basic amino acids of the histones interacting with the negatively charged phosphate groups of the DNA. One molecule of histone H1 is associated with each wound core which accommodates approximately 146 bp of DNA. The cores are, in turn, packaged into a compact regular structure with about 200 bp of DNA between each core. The amino terminal tails of the histones are subject to post-translational modification, in particular by acetylation of lysine. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone acetyl transferases (HATs) determine the pattern of histone acetylation, which together with other dynamic sequential post-translational modifications might represent a ‘code’ that can be recognised by non-histone proteins forming complexes involved in the regulation of gene expression. This and the ability of histone deacetylases (HDACs) to also modify non-histonic substrates and participate in multi-protein complexes contributes to the regulation of gene transcription, cell cycle progression and differentiation, genome stability and stress responses. HDAC inhibitors cause the induction of differentiation, growth arrest and/or apoptosis in a broad spectrum of transformed cells in culture and tumours in animals, including both haematological cancers and solid tumours. These inhibitory effects are believed to be caused, in part, by accumulation of acetylated proteins, such as nucleosomal histones, which appear to play a major role in regulation of gene transcription. It has been recently discovered that these compounds might represent novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of genetic disorders such as β-thalassemia and sickle cell anemia. Hemoglobin (Hb) is a tetramer of two α-like and two β-like globin polypeptide chains. In human, the genes for α-globins are clustered on chromosome 16, which contains one gene for ζ and two genes for α (α 1  and α 2 , the proteins of which are identical). The genes for the β-like globins are clustered on chromosome 11, which contains genes for ε, β and δ, one gene for each, and two slightly different genes for γ. In addition, these clusters contain various sites that are responsible for the regulation of the expression of each gene (Steinberg, M H et al, Genetics, Pathophysiology and Clinical Management, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 2001). The expression of the globin genes is regulated during ontogeny. In humans, globin production is characterized by two major “switches” (Thein, S L Br. J. Haematol., 2004, 124, 264). Production of embryonic Hbs switches after the first two months into fetal Hb (HbF) (α 2 γ 2 ), and then, again, before and immediately after birth, into adult Hb (HbA) (α 2 β 2 ). Since both HbA and HbF contain a chains, the switch from the former to the latter represents a decrease in the expression of the γ-globin genes, associated with an increase of β-globin gene expression. The prevalence of HbF during embryonic life is explained by its high affinity to oxygen, a property that allows it to remove oxygen from HbA in the maternal red blood cells (RBCs) through the placenta. Immediately after birth the newborn has 85-98% HbF, which gradually decreases to &lt;5% at the age of one year. In adult life HbA is the major Hb, a small &lt;5% is HbA2 (α 2 δ 2 ) and the rest (&lt;5%) is HbF which is concentrated in a few RBC. β-Thalassemia and sickle cell anemia are two of the most common single gene disorders of humans. Both diseases result from different mutations of the β-globin gene that encodes two of the tetramaeric globin chains that make up the major hemoglobin present in adult red cells (adult haemoglobin, HbA). In β-thalassemias, mutations affecting the β-globin gene or its regulatory regions cause absence (β 0 ) or reduced (β + ) synthesis of β-globin chains. This is associated with a corresponding excess of the complementary α-globin. The outcome of this unbalanced globin production is the destruction by apoptosis of erythroid precursors in the bone marrow and at the extramedullary sites (ineffective erythropoiesis) and short survival of RBCs in the peripheral blood (Bank, A. Blood, 2006, 107, 435; Stamatoyannopoulos, G. Exp. Hematol. 2005, 33, 259). Sickle cell anemia results from a missense mutation (glutamine to valine substitution) at the 6 th  aminoacid of the β-globin chain. The resulting sickle Hb (HbS) forms insoluble polymers within the cytosol upon deoxygenation, with subsequent deformation of the red blood cells and vaso occlusion. Patients with β-thalassemia and sickle cell disease do not have clinical complications of their disease at birth when their red cells contain the fetal form of Hb (HbF). The proportion of HbF in postnatal life is influenced by various physiological and genetic factors. Epidemiological findings have shown that increased HbF in β-thalassemia ameliorates the clinical symptoms (Olivieri, N F Semin. Hematol. 1996, 33, 24; Rochette, J et al Blood Rev. 1994, 8, 213). The most convincing finding was found in individuals with mutations associated with hereditary persistence of HbF (HPFH) in adult life (Bhardwaj, U et al Mol. Diagn. 2005, 9, 151). Coexistence of homozygous β-thalassemia with HPFH is asymptomatic. It seems that HbF can functionally compensate for the absence of β-globin chains (Witt, O Am. J. Hematol. 2000, 64, 319). In sickle cell disease, the presence of HbF reduces the effective concentration of HbS, thus decreasing the propensity for intracellular polymerization. The fetal γ-globin chains also interfere with the ability of HbS to polymerize by heterohybrid formation. These findings have generated considerable interest in identifying molecular and pharmacological ways to increase the production of HbF. Indeed, several groups of the compounds were found to reactivate the γ-globin genes in post-natal erythroid cells. Several findings suggest that inhibition of the activity of histone deacetylases (HDACs) is associated with an increased expression of the γ-globin genes (Cao, H Hematology, 2004, 9, 223). Among HDAC inhibitors, trichostatin was found to possess high HbF-inducing activity in human and mouse erythroleukemia cells. Witt et al (Blood, 2003, 101, 2001) showed that, among several specific HDAC inhibitors tested, apicidin was by far the most efficient HbF-inducer (at nM to μM concentrations in K562 cells) and that its effect involved, in addition to HDAC inhibition, p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling. Further HDAC inhibitors were recently characterized for their effect on human γ-globin gene expression in transgenic mice. Among the hydroxamic acid derivatives of short chain fatty acids studied butyryl and propionyl hydroxamate were most effective, increasing the human γ/murine α-globin mRNA ratios by 33.9% and 71%, respectively. This was associated with an increase in reticulocytes hematocrit, and the in vivo levels of BFU-E (Cao, H Exp. Hematol. 2005, 33, 1443). WO 2006/061638 discloses inhibitors of histone deacetylase structurally related to the compounds of the present invention. Such compounds are useful for treating cellular proliferative diseases, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease, schizophrenia and stroke. None of the compounds disclosed in WO 2006/061638 are within the instant invention.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to protective eyewear, more specifically disposable protective eyewear to protect a wearer from splashes, sprays, spatter or droplets of blood or other potentially infectious materials. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Protective eyewear in infectious environments, such as hospitals and operating rooms, is imperative to protect employees from hazardous exposure when working. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation 1910.1030 (d)(x) requires employees to wear protective masks and eyewear whenever splashes, spray, spatter, or droplets of blood or other potentially infectious materials may be generated and eye, nose, or mouth contamination can be reasonably anticipated. The regulations require the eyewear be either full length face shields or glasses or goggles with solid side shields. Many healthcare supply manufacturers have made and sold goggles and masks, however these devices are prone to fogging and are costly. Known products are not comfortable nor do they possess the stylish appearances. They are also difficult to clean, further enhancing the possibility of exposure to infectious materials. In light of these risks, disposable protective eyewear has become more prevalent in environments containing infectious materials. These disposable glasses are typically a single unit containing a protective shield and a frame. The lenses must be disposed of in order ensure a sanitary environment, although the frame may be sterilized and reused. The ability to reuse the frame makes it more cost-effective. Other low cost disposable eyewear products consist of a removable shield that slides on and off the frame through holes in the sides of the shield. While this does provide a cost effective solution, the holes perforated in the shield allow for passage of infectious materials through the eyewear and onto the face or into the eye. This raises issues with respect to OSHA compliance. Another hazard presented by known disposable eyewear is an opening directly above the eyes between the forehead and the frame of the eyewear. This exposes the wearer to splatters and sprays that may come from above the sightline of the wearer. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides affordable, anti-fog coating on both sides of the disposable eye shield, anti-glare, protective eyewear that maximizes protection of the eyes and face from infectious materials, while giving the wearer a maximum range of vision. In addition to maximizing protection, the present invention presents eyewear with a disposable shield that is OSHA compliant with no holes or perforations in the side shields. In one embodiment of the present invention, a molded plastic frame is made in a substantially U-shaped design. Two bends at the closed end of the frame have guards extending from the frame inward that will rest against the forehead of the wearer. The outside of the frame contains projections intermittently spaced which engage with mating structures on an eye shield, attaching the eye shield to the frame to protect the eyes and face. The eye shield is a thin plastic sheet, cut to include a notch for the wearer&#39;s nose. It is coated on both sides with an anti-fogging material. A color band may be built into the top of the eye shield for easy gripping and identification. The top of the shield contains the mating structures in the form of small holes intermittently spaced that snap over the projections on the outside of the frame to attach the shield to the frame. Advantages of the present invention include provision of eye protection that is compliant with OSHA standards. There are no exposure holes in the eye shield through which infectious materials may pass. The eye shield is held in place by use of a tapered knob that attaches it to the frame without damaging the lens or creating any opening. The protective eyewear according to the present invention eliminates exposure points around the eyes and temples of the wearer. Another advantageous feature is the present invention provides a cost effective solution to protective eyewear by utilizing disposable eye shields while being able to re-use the frames. An additional advantage of the present invention is the creation of space between the wearer&#39;s eyes and the eye shield sufficient to permit the wearing of typical prescription glasses under the protective eyewear. Another advantageous feature of the present invention is the ease of interchangeability of the eye shield. The eye shield snaps along the outside of the frame making it easier and faster to remove and replace when needed without creating fingerprints or smudges on the eye shield. The positioning of the tapered knob and the angle of the lens due to the use of the shelf on the frame results in a lens angle that substantially eliminates glare. The frame is wide on the outside near the temples which naturally conforms to the human head.",

    "abstract": "The tastiness, and hence the enjoyment, of fried food decreases soon after the foods have been taken from the frying liquid, particularly because the associated decrease in temperature produces a more or less pronounced decrease in the crispness of the foods. This evolution occurs in particular in the case of french fries, which generally represent a large percentage of fried foods. A multifunction electric cooking appliance is known, for example from U.S. Pat. No. 4,889,972, which has a case containing a bowl associated with electric heating means, the side wall of the case having a lateral opening permitting access to a chamber provided in the case below the bowl. Electric heating means are also provided for heating this chamber. However, the upper wall of the chamber is formed by a perforated sheet. This arrangement directly exposes the food contained in the chamber to radiation from the electric heating means. In addition, this arrangement complicates cleaning of the chamber. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a new household electric fryer that permits the preparation of relatively large quantities of foods without affecting, in a significant manner, their eating qualities or enjoyability, and without requiring a large volume of frying liquid. The present invention also provides an electric fryer of the type described above having an overall size that is comparable to that of conventional household fryers. In addition, the present invention provides an electric fryer of the type described above that can be fabricated at low cost. Finally, the present invention provides a fryer of the type described above that is easy to use. More specifically, the present invention provides a household electric fryer having a case provided with a bottom and a side wall, the case containing a bowl associated with electric heating means, the side wall of the case having a lateral opening permitting access to a warming chamber disposed in the case below the bowl. The electric heating means and/or additional electric heating means are provided to heat the warming chamber. A protective sheet, or a reflector, or the bottom of the bowl provides an imperforate surface arranged between the electric heating means and the warming chamber. In effect, the presence of a protective sheet, a reflector, or the bottom of the bowl between the electric heating means and the warming chamber permits the temperature reached in the warming chamber to be limited, with a more uniform diffusion of the heat. A direct exposure to radiation from the electric heating means used for heating the frying oil would produce temperatures that are locally too high in the warming chamber, which would contribute to degrading the quality of the fried food placed in this chamber. The arrangements according to the present invention permit foods produced in two successive frying operations to be served in good condition simultaneously. These arrangements permit the serving of two different types of foods, for example french fries and breaded meats, or even to serve a larger quantity of the same food, without having to use a larger quantity of cooking liquid. Foods held in the warming chamber retain a better eating quality. In addition, when two different foods must be fried for different times, these arrangements facilitate organization of the cooking. In addition, these arrangements facilitate cleaning of the warming chamber. According to one form of construction according to the invention, the protective sheet forms at least a part of an upper wall of the warming chamber. The electric heating means can be in permanent contact with the protective sheet for fryers having a fixed or removable bowl in which the heating elements are mounted in the case. However, the electric heating element can also be fixed to a bowl removably mounted in the case. The protective sheet permits a better distribution of heat in the warming chamber and avoids overheating of foods disposed close to the heating means. The protective sheet also facilitates cleaning of the interior of the warming chamber, and prevents the user from contacting the heating means. Then, according to a preferred form of construction, the protective sheet is in thermal contact with the electric heating means. This arrangement is well adapted to fryers having a bowl that is fixed in the case, or even fryers having a bowl that is removable and that has a heating element fixed to its bottom. Alternatively, the protective sheet can be arranged at a distance from the electric heating means. Also advantageously, the protective sheet forms at least one part of a side wall of the warming chamber. This arrangement permits the provision of a compartment particularly for receiving electric components of the fryer. According to another form of construction, a reflector is mounted in a counter-bowl in which the bowl itself is housed. This arrangement is well adapted for fryers having a bowl that is removably mounted in the case, the heating elements being fixed to the case. According to yet another form of construction, the electric heating means are arranged at the interior of the bowl. These heating means then directly heat the cooking liquid. According to still another form of construction, the electric heating means are capable of heating the bottom of the bowl, and the warming chamber is disposed at least partially below the electric heating means. According to this form of construction, the electric heating means can be disposed in the bottom wall of the bowl. The electric heating means can alternatively be disposed against the bottom of the bowl, inside or outside the bowl. The electric heating means can also be disposed at the interior of the bowl in proximity to its bottom. In this case, the bowl will not present a cool zone under the heating element and the temperature of the bottom of the bowl is close to that of the frying liquid. The electric heating means can also be disposed outside of the bowl in proximity to its bottom. Heating of the bowl will then be effectuated by radiation, or even by conduction if a thermal bridge connects the electric heating means to the bowl. In such appliances, a space is provided under the bottom of the bowl to avoid heating the bottom of the bowl to an unduly high temperature. Arrangements according to the invention permit utilization of the space present under the bottom of bowl and to use the heat furnished by the heating means to keep foods that have been fried in a first frying operation warm during frying of a subsequent quantity of food. If necessary, additional electric heating means can complete the heating of the warming chamber. According to another form of construction, additional electric heating means are provided to effect at least the major part of the heating in the warming chamber. According to this form of construction, the electric heating means are for example arranged in the bowl in a manner to form a cooler zone in the frying liquid. This latter arrangement contributing to increasing the total volume of the frying liquid, the arrangements according to the invention permit one to envision a reduction in the useful volume of the frying liquid while permitting the production of large quantities of appetizing fried foods.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates generally to the field of dishwashers and specifically to a controller for a dishwasher having alternating liquid flow to spray arms. 2. Description of the Related Art Washing machines, particularly dishwashers, often have two or more spray arms for directing washing liquid at objects to be washed. Typically, a lower spray arm is located near the bottom of a wash tub and an upper spray arm is located in a middle area or near the top of the wash tub. A pump is provided to deliver liquid from a sump in the bottom of the tub to the spray arms. Commonly, the liquid is delivered simultaneously to both spray arms in more or less equal amounts. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,741,353 and 5,264,043, both to Milocco and incorporated herein by reference, show and describe an apparatus and method for alternating liquid flow between the spray arms. A specialized ball valve switches flow from one arm to the other when operation of the pump is interrupted for a certain amount of time. The Milocco references show a programmed electronic controller for operating the pump to achieve proper operation of the valve. It would be desirable to use an electromechanical controller for such an apparatus because of the inherent simplicity and reliability. Electromechanical controllers for dishwashers are well known, as shown, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,771,894; 2,825,665; 3,199,525; 3,439,687; 3,440,399; 3,835,880; 4,159,211; 4,559,959 all incorporated herein by reference. Typically these controllers have a cam wheel defining a plurality of coaxial cam disks each adapted to operate one or more switches. The switches are connected to control different machine functions. The cam wheel is driven by a timer motor. In some installations, the controller is provided with an auxiliary cam wheel to control a specific function of the washer. For example, the auxiliary cam can be connected to control a water valve to provide a brief (about 11 seconds) inlet of water to purge the sump of dirty water at the end of a washing operation. Such controllers are simple, reliable, and adequate for most dishwashing functions. Therefore, it is desirable to adapt an electromechanical timer to control the short and precise lobes required for the Milocco ball valve. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides washer with two sprayers for spraying fluid and a pump for delivering fluid to the sprayers. A valve controls flow from the pump to the sprayers to alternate fluid flow between the sprayers. A controller is adapted for stopping and starting the pump thereby controlling the valve to alternate flow of fluid to the sprayers. The controller includes a switch connected to energize the pump and a first timer wheel adapted to operate the switch so as to energize the pump for a certain period of time. A second timer wheel is adapted to override the first timer wheel to operate the switch to deenergize the pump for a certain period of time. Preferably, the valve comprises a ball adapted to block one of two conduits in communication with respective sprayers. The valve is adapted to move the ball from one conduit to the other when water flow to the valve is interrupted. A second switch is connected in parallel with the first switch and adapted to operate the pump regardless of the state of the first switch. The controller also includes a timer motor adapted to rotate the timer wheels. The timer wheels are rotatable cam wheels and a cam follower mounted on the switch is operated by the first timer wheel. A lever is operated by the second timer wheel and disposed to open the switch. An appendage mounted on the switch is operated by the lever. The switch comprises a pair of spring arms having electrical contacts adapted to close a circuit. Thus, the invention provides a simple and reliable washer adapted to alternately spray water from upper and lower spray arms.",

    "abstract": "The invention relates to a suction device for dental treatment units having a suction hose and a suction cannula. 2. Description of the Art For dental treatment units, suction devices are known for use in specific working processes, e.g., cavity preparation or stump preparation for crowns and the like, where cutting, grinding, polishing or drilling tools are used in a constricted space for a long time. The suction devices are used for sucking off dust occurring in the case of high-speed drilling of hard dental substances, fillings or stopping materials, etc., which with the water spray supplied as the coolant form a suspension mist and which through whirled up microorganisms from the plaque, saliva and oral mucosa secretions form a health hazard for the patient, dentist and dental nurse. The known suction device comprises an approximately 25 mm thick, elastic plastic hose and an approximately 10 mm thick suction cannula, whose end is flat, i.e., slotlike, and which is used for the suction of the spray mist of the dental turbine with which a hard metal cutting tool or a drilling tool is operated at high speed. The suction hose leads into an intake connection integrated into the dental treatment unit, which is connected to a fixed suction installation. In the prior art suction device, which is installed on the dental treatment unit, the suction hose with the suction cannula is guided and manually positioned by the dental nurse or dentist. It is therefore necessary during cutting or drilling operations in the mouth for a dental nurse to always be present for suction purposes, otherwise the dentist is forced to hold the suction connection himself, so that he is only able to work with one hand in the mouth for the preparation operations. He then does not have a second hand available for guiding the dental mirror, e.g., for keeping the field of view free. The problem of the invention is therefore to provide a suction device for the spray mist in the case of dental drilling and cutting processes in the oral cavity, so that for certain operations the dentist no longer requires the assistance of a dental nurse. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Due to the fact that, according to the present invention, the suction hose is located in or on a three-dimensionally movable flexible tube, the activity of the dental nurse is replaced by a flexible support to which the suction cannula is fixed which, once in the desired position, maintains said position in a non-manual or &#34;mechanical&#34; manner. Through different constructions and associations between the flexible tube and the suction hose, it is possible both to provide a suction device fixed to the dental treatment unit and also to reequip an existing suction device and then the flexible tube can be fixed with a clamping device or the like to the dental treatment unit. Through the provision of a separate flexible tube to which the suction hose can be fixed by suction clips, it is possible to rapidly fit or detach the suction device.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to the curling or waving of human hair. The present invention relates more particularly to chemically assisted curling or waving of human hair having a flat or oval cross sections. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Hair which has a relatively flat or oval cross section typically has naturally tight curls of about 1/4 inch in diameter or less. Such tightly curled hair has proven difficult to safely and consistently relax and re-style into waves or looser curls typically having a diameter of 1 inch or more. In order to change the configuration of hair from tightly curled or kinked to loosely curled or waved, it is necessary to strip the hair of its tightly curled structure and rebuild the structure of the hair into the new desired configuration. Previous methods of removing the tightly curled structure from hair often left the hair in a severly damaged condition. Often after the hair is restructured into its newly waved or loosely curled construction, the individual is reluctant to wash his or her hair for fear of removing any protective oils from the hair and cause further damage or loss of the desired loose curl or wave. A typical process employed to re-style tightly curled hair into a new configuration involves first treating the hair with a caustic agent which is absorbed into the hair to break the internal sulfide bonds. It is the sulfide bonds which hold the hair in its tightly curled configuration. Next a test curl is made to determine whether sufficient sulfide bonds have been broken to allow the hair to be re-styled. If the results of the test curl are favorable the hair dresser quickly curls the hair on curling rods If the test curl fails, the hair dresser conducts a second test curl and continues with a series of curls until the result is favorable. Once curled on the curling rod, a neutralization composition is placed upon the hair to allow the sulfide bonds to reform, thereby retaining the hair in its newly curled configuration. However, the use of the above method is not precise and often results in under or over processing of the hair. Under processing results in an incomplete recurling of the hair, and over processing results in substantial hair damage and breakage, and generally dull, lifeless and unmanageable hair. Accordingly, a need exists for a process of re-curling or waving previously tightly curled hair, which significantly reduces the chance of under or over processing of the hair. Further, a need exists for a process of re-curling or waving such hair which results in substantially less damage to the hair. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a method by which hair which is tightly curled or kinked can be consistently relaxed and reformed into a looser curl or wave configuration, with substantially less damage to the hair. The present invention provides a process for reforming tightly curled hair into a loosely curled or waved configuration comprising the steps of: first, contacting the hair with an aqueous relaxant composition having a pH of between about 8.0 and about 11.0 and comprising at least a major proportion of water and between about 5 to 10 wt-%, based upon the aqueous relaxant composition of an alkaline thioglycolate. Second, rinsing the hair with a neutral aqueous solution so as to remove a substantial portion of the relaxant composition; third, contacting the hair with an aqueous suspending composition having a pH of between about 3.5 and 7.0, the aqueous suspending composition comprising at least a major proportion of water and about 0.0001 to 0.1 wt-% of ammonium chloride and 0.0001 to about 0.1 wt.-% of magnesium chloride, both based on the suspending composition, the suspending composition is preferably rinsed out and reapplied to the hair; fourth, the hair is wrapped onto curling rods; fifth, contacting the hair with a heat generating composition for a period of time and in an amount sufficient to increase the hair temperature to between 100° F. and 130° F. and preferably to between about 110° F. and about 120° F., the heat generating composition comprising a first solution, and a second solution, the first and second solutions are provided in separate containers until application to the hair, when combined the first and second solutions react to produce sufficient heat and provide between about 5 and about 10 wt-% unreacted ammonium thioglycolate after reaction between the first and the second solutions is complete; the hair is preferably rinsed with water to rinse most of the heat generation composition from the hair; sixth, contacting the hair with a sufficient amount of an oxidizing composition, such as sodium bromate solution, to oxidize substantially all of the remaining alkaline thioglycolate and derivatives; seventh, removing the curling rods; and eighth, contacting the hair with an acidic protein final rinse solution for a period of time and in an amount sufficient to cause the hair to reach substantially a neutral pH.",

    "abstract": "The object of the present invention is to produce absorbent incontinence articles of the open type with attached diaper wings at high production speeds without impairment of the functionality of the closing means. Moreover, the incontinence articles should be made available in a user-friendly arrangement. This object is achieved according to the invention by an incontinence article of the open type with rear material sections attached to a lateral edge section in the back section of the main part, and with front material sections (diaper wings, lateral flaps or sections) attached in the front section, such that prior to use of the incontinence article the rear material sections, the edge section of which has a closing element which comprises a closing element tape with a free fingerlift tab which is folded back onto the inside of the material section prior to use, are folded onto themselves along fold lines extending parallel to the longitudinal direction and forming inner segments, central segments and outer segments, the inner segments being attached to the respective lateral edge section of the main part and the outer segments comprising the longitudinal edge section and the central segments being folded onto the inside of the outer segments in such a way that the central segments fully cover the free fingerlift tab of the closing element tape and that the thus folded rear material sections are turned in inward along turning-in axes onto the inside of the back section of the main part to form a turned-in arrangement, the inside of the edge section in the turned-in arrangement being oriented facing away from the inside of the back section of the main part. For closing the incontinence article when applied, the closing element tapes interact adhesively detachably together with an outside of the front section of the main part and/or the material sections in the front section. For this purpose, the closing element tapes may have, for instance, a pressure-sensitive adhesive zone or mechanical closing aids, such as hooks and loops. The inventors have realized that the cause of the unintentional opening of the closing element tapes in the production process is a draft force which bears on the closing element tapes and which increases with increasing production speeds. The risk of impact from this draft force is particularly present at the point in time when the rear material sections in the folded arrangement are already turned in onto the inside of the main part and, in particular, immediately prior to or during subsequent folding of the incontinence article transversely to its longitudinal direction. When this draft force exceeds the adhesive force of the closing element tape on the inside of the material section onto which it was turned back, the closing element opens unintentionally. As described above, suchlike incontinence articles are often completely unusable. The inventors have further realized that the closing elements are protected to the greatest extent from the occurring draft force by the arrangement according to the invention. This will be explained in more detail with reference to the figures. The inventors have, in a preferred embodiment of the incontinence article according to the invention, further provided a product which, as a result of the arrangement of the outer longitudinal edge sections of the rear material sections being such that these are oriented facing away from the longitudinal center axis of the product in the direction of the outer lateral longitudinal edges of the main part, can be comfortably unfolded by the user. In order for the user to identify the rear material sections as being such and to be able to comfortably grip and unfold them, the closing element tape of the absorbent incontinence article is preferably covered over at least 25% and at most 90% of its extent in the transverse direction, preferably over at least 40% and at most 75% of its extent in the transverse direction, by central segments, or the central segments cover the closing element tape over at least 10 mm and at most 50 mm, furthermore preferably over at least 20 mm and at most 40 mm in the transverse direction. Preferably, an outer lateral edge of the outer segment of a rear material section projects in the transverse direction beyond the central segments folded over said lateral edge by the dimension D. The dimension D is preferably at least 10% and at most 85%, furthermore preferably at least 40% and at most 60%, of the width L 5  of each outer segment. Alternatively, the projection in the transverse direction by the dimension D is preferably at least 5 mm and at most 50 mm, furthermore preferably at least 24 mm and at most 36 mm. The rear material sections are preferably folded onto themselves such that they are divided by the folds into four segments each, the widths L 3 , L 4  of the respective central segments being smaller than the widths L 5  of the respective outer segments. Furthermore preferably, the widths L 3 , L 4  of the central segments are identical, and/or the ratio of the widths L 3 , L 4  of the central segments to the widths L 5  of the outer segments is between 1:1 and 1:2.5. The folding sequence of the rear material sections onto themselves is preferably such that first an outside of a respective rear material section is folded onto an outside, i.e. onto itself. The double-layered arrangement thus formed is subsequently once again folded onto itself, such that an inside of a respective rear material section is folded onto an inside. A regionally four-layered arrangement is formed. This may, if appropriate, be once again folded onto itself into an eight-layered arrangement. In the folding of the rear material sections onto themselves, fold lines preferably do not cut across the closing element tapes folded back on the inside of the material sections. The rear material sections thus folded onto one another are preferably detachably fastened in the folded configuration, in particular by means of spot-like joining points created by ultrasonic welding. In the context of the detachable fastening of the folded material sections, reference is made to DE102009022529.3. It is furthermore advantageous if a gripping region is provided on a respective longitudinal edge section of each of the folded rear material sections. This region intended for the manual gripping of the folded material section may comprise the entire longitudinal edge section. Preferably, the gripping region comprises a part of the longitudinal edge section which is free from joining points, preferably a region located in the center of the longitudinal edge section. It has been demonstrated that the detachable fastening by means of joining points may be designed such that the respective material section can be completely unfolded by a single tug on the corresponding gripping region, with preferably all of the joining points being released or coming apart. In a development of the invention it is advantageous if the rear material sections have a surface extent (in cm 2 ) which is larger, preferably by at least 10%, in particular by at least 15%, than the front material sections. In particular, the length L 7  of the rear material sections, that is to say their extent in the longitudinal direction of the diaper, may be at least 13 cm, furthermore in particular at least 18 cm, and furthermore in particular at least 22 cm. It is furthermore advantageous if the length L 7  of the rear material sections is at least 10%, in particular at least 15%, furthermore in particular at least 20% and furthermore in particular at least 22% of the overall length of the disposable incontinence diaper. Advantageously, the overall length of the disposable incontinence diaper is 50-120 cm, in particular 60-110 cm and furthermore in particular 70-110 cm. It is furthermore advantageous if the front material sections have a length L 6  which is, in particular at least 5%, furthermore in particular at least 10%, furthermore in particular at least 15% and furthermore in particular at most 50% shorter than the rear material sections. In a development of the invention it is advantageous if the width L 1  of the material sections, that is the extent of the material sections in the transverse direction beyond the lateral edge of the main part of the diaper, is 12-40 cm, in particular 13-30 cm, furthermore in particular 14-27 cm. Preferably, the front material sections have the same width as the rear material sections. Preferably, the front material sections are also folded onto themselves prior to use of the folded-together article, preferably along fold lines extending parallel to the longitudinal direction. The fold lines in such an instance divide the front material sections into four segments each, the widths L 3 , L 4  of the central segments being smaller than the width L 5  of the outer segments. Preferably, the folding of the front material sections onto themselves is such that first an outside of a respective front material section is folded onto an outside, i.e. onto itself. The double-layered arrangement thus formed is subsequently once again folded onto itself, such that an inside of a respective front material section is folded onto an inside. It has furthermore proven advantageous if the front and/or rear material sections are made from a non-woven material. In particular, all non-woven materials which contain at least one component on the basis of a thermoplastic polymer in their composition are suitable. The non-woven materials may contain fibers of PE, PP, PET, rayon, cellulose, PA and blends of these fibers. Bi-component and multi-component fibers are also conceivable and advantageous. In particular, card webs, spun-bonded non-wovens, hydroentangled non-wovens, SM non-wovens, SMS non-wovens, SMMS non-wovens or also laminates made from one or multiple layers of these types of non-wovens are advantageous, wherein S refers to spunbond and M refers to meltblown non-woven layers. Spun-bonded non-wovens are particularly preferred, as these have a high strength in the longitudinal and transverse directions and thus can withstand particularly well the shearing forces bearing on them from any mechanical closing aids that may be used. In order to prevent fibers from being torn out of the non-woven structure in the process of releasing the mechanical closing aids, it is advantageous to provide the non-woven component with an embossed pattern, by means of which preferably all fibers of the non-woven component are integrated. In such an instance, a thermally embossed pattern is advantageous in particular, this being advantageously created in particular by calendering the non-woven with the addition of thermal energy. For the manufacture of a folded incontinence article according to the invention, the rear material sections folded onto themselves are turned in along turning-in axes preferably extending through the main part of the diaper, preferably parallel to the longitudinal axis, onto the inside of the back section in such a way that the material sections come to lie at a small distance from one another or abut one another or overlap one another at least regionally. Advantageously, the lateral edge of the main part in the region of the attachment of the rear material sections could form the turning-in axes. Accordingly, the invention also relates to a method for manufacturing a folded incontinence article as described above, the rear material sections first being folded onto themselves parallel to the longitudinal axis and the thus formed double-layered arrangement subsequently once again being folded onto itself parallel to the longitudinal axis, the free fingerlift tab of the closing element tape being fully covered by central segments to form an at least regionally four-layered arrangement. The rear material sections thus folded onto themselves are turned in inward along the turning-in axes onto the inside of the back section of the main part, such that the inside of the longitudinal edge section of a respective rear material section is oriented facing away from the inside of the back section of the main part. Preferably, the material sections are first folded onto themselves, then fastened in a folded configuration to a first and a second lateral edge section on the back section of the main part and then turned in onto the inside of the main part.",

    "abstract": "Accordingly, the inventors have developed a new and novel approach to securing a mattress stitch in a tissue flap. An instrument that combines the function of both grasping the tissue and passing sutures through the tissue to form a mattress stitch is herein described. The instrument includes a pair of grasping jaws that oppose each other along a line substantially perpendicular to the long axis of the instrument. The distal end of the instrument incorporates the fixed jaw, and proximal to that jaw is a moveable jaw that is controlled by the user via a lever on the handgrip. In a preferred method of the present invention the instrument is inserted through a portal known as a trocar cannula. The portal is created by first making an incision in the skin, and then inserting a cannula through the incision to the repair site. The distal end of the instrument is inserted through the cannula under direct visualization from a second trocar cannula that has been previously inserted. The visualization is accomplished via an endoscope, of a type well known in the art. The instrument is inserted until the jaws reach, for example, tom rotator cuff tissue. In operation, the distal end of the grasper aspect of the instrument is positioned at the repair site underneath the tissue to be grasped. The moveable jaw pivots toward the stationary jaw by squeezing the handle lever. The handle lever moves inward by pivoting about a pivot pin. Once the appropriate section of tissue is isolated and grasped by the jaws, the lever may be locked in its closed position using a latch mechanism. Once the surgeon is satisfied with the placement of the grasper on the grasped tissue, the surgeon can then deploy the suture needles to create a mattress stitch in the tissues, for example, the above-mentioned torn rotator cuff. In operation, the suture needles may be advanced through the grasped tissues by pulling on a second lever. The lever is directly connected to the needles via a connecting rod, and the lever is pulled against the force of a return spring. In turn, the connecting rod pushes a needle carriage, with suture needles held in the carriage. The needle carriage resides behind the proximal moveable jaw of the instrument, and, at the urging of the lever via the connecting rod, is able to move distally with the needles passing around the moveable jaw. As the carriage moves distally, the tips of the suture needles begin to clear the distal edge of apertures created in a more proximal portion of the stationary jaw, and begin to penetrate through the top of the grasped tissue and advance distally towards the more distal portion of the stationary jaw. The stationary distal jaw incorporates two apertures that are adapted to receive the ends of the suture. Secondary open channels perpendicular to the suture apertures are configured with a specific geometry designed to direct the suture needles across the apertures containing the ends of the sutures. As the suture needles approach the end of their stroke, the distal ends of the needles have passed completely through the grasped tissues and begin to enter the secondary open channels in the stationary distal jaw. At this point, any pull force being applied by the grasper on the grasped tissues is relaxed. Once the tissue is in a relaxed state, the jaws of the grasper are then opened. The handle lever is unlocked from the locking mechanism and returns to an open position due to the pull force exerted on it by means of a return spring. As the return spring pulls on the lever, it pivots about a pin. To complete the pull out of the suture needles, it is necessary to pull on the grasper, and to remove it from the repair site. The instrument can be retracted back through the portal via the trocar cannula. As the instrument is removed from the suture site, the free ends of the suture are retrieved as well. This causes the suture to pass through the tissues at the puncture sites. As the suture is pulled through, the loop end of the suture is pulled snug against the underside of the tissues to form what is referred to as a mattress stitch. This process may be repeated as necessary, depending on the number sutures required for the particular procedure being undertaken. Now it may be seen by those skilled in the art, that the combination of grasping tissues to be sutured and precisely placing a mattress stitch in the grasped tissues, while working through a trocar port, effects a significant advance in the art. Advantages of the present invention thus include providing an endoscopic instrument adapted for the grasping of tissues and creating a mattress stitch within those tissues, as well as the provision of a suturing instrument that allows for the reloading of additional sutures for placement of subsequent stitches. Additionally, the inventive system is advantageous in that it provides for direct capture of the suture material. More particularly, there is provided in one preferred embodiment of the present invention a suturing device, comprising a distal portion which is engaged with a length of suture, as well as a needle which is axially movable distally and proximally. A soft tissue receiving portion, preferably comprising a clamp having first and second jaws, wherein one of the first and second jaws is movable relative to the other to grasp soft tissue therein, is disposed proximally of the distal portion. A ramp portion for moving the needle radially inwardly and outwardly as the needle moves axially over the ramp portion is also provided. In a preferred embodiment, the distal portion for retaining the suture comprises a suture cartridge with a molded tip, having grooves for accommodating the suture. The ramp portion comprises a radially outwardly sloping entrance ramp for moving the needle radially outwardly as the needle moves axially in a distal direction, as well as a radially inwardly sloping retraction ramp for moving the needle radially inwardly as the needle moves axially in a proximal direction. The needle comprises a distal point, a proximal shaft, and a hook defining a suture holding area. The hook portion of the needle is uniquely designed to provide a positive tactile indication as to when the suture has been capture within the suture holding area. This design includes a terminus of the hook, which is cantilevered proximally from a distal end of the needle. A bump on the needle in a location opposed to the hook terminus is provided, so that the hook terminus and the bump together provide a tactile sensation to a user when suture passes thereover into the suture holding area. In preferred embodiments, a second needle, as well as a second ramp portion, is provided, so that a mattress stitch may be created. A sheath, which is slidable relative to the needle, is provided for selectively covering each needle, particularly when the needle is being retracted proximally through the soft tissue, to prevent unnecessary damage thereto. In another aspect of the invention, there is provided a needle for a suturing device, which comprises a distal point, a proximal shaft, and a hook defining a suture holding area. As noted above, the needle preferably further comprises a terminus of the hook, which is cantilevered proximally from a distal end of the needle, as well as a bump on the needle in a location opposed to the hook terminus. In still another aspect of the invention, there is described a method of suturing soft tissue using a suturing device, which comprises steps of retaining a portion of soft tissue to be sutured, and moving a needle having a hook which defines a suture holding area distally, so that the hook is disposed in a location past the portion of soft tissue and past a length of suture which is retained on a distal portion of the suturing device. Then, the needle is moved proximally in order to capture the suture so that it is retained in the suture holding area. Once the suture is captured, the needle is moved a further distance proximally, so that the needle draws the suture through the portion of soft tissue, thereby suturing the soft tissue. Preferably, when the needle is moved distally, it is also moved radially outwardly in order to avoid contacting, and possibly damaging, the length of suture. Additionally, when the needle is moved proximally, it is also moved radially inwardly in order to ensure proper capture of the suture. In preferred methods, it is further desirable to cover the needle with a sheath prior to retracting the needle proximally through the soft tissue. The invention, together with additional features and advantages thereof, may best be understood by reference to the following description taken in conjunction with the accompanying illustrative drawing.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to generally to laWn mowers. Specifically, the invention relates to mulching lawn mowers and more specifically, the invention relates to a mulching attachment for use with a rotary lawn mower. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The disposal of leaves, grass clippings and other waste plant material greatly complicates lawn maintenance. If left on a lawn, such materials will decay, forming an unsightly mat which can choke and destroy the lawn. Typically, gardeners remove these materials from lawns either by raking, or by the use of lawn mower attachments which collect such debris. In any instance, the collected leaves, grass clippings and other debris must be disposed. Disposal in a land fill or by burning is generally expensive and derogatory to the environment. Additionally, collection and disposal of plant waste represents a loss of available nutrients. In some instances, gardeners choose to compost plant waste thereby eliminating disposal problems and providing a valuable fertilizer material. Compost piles generally occupy a fairly large amount of space and tend to be malodorous; and hence, they are of limited use, particularly in urban environments. If plant waste is chopped very finely, it may be directly applied to a lawn without danger of forming a dense mat and harming the lawn. Such finely chopped plant waste is generally referred to as &#34;mulch&#34; and the term &#34;mulching&#34; as used herein, will refer to the pulverizing or macerating of plant material to produce mulch. It has heretofore been known to equip lawn mowers with variously configured mulching blades which finely chop grass, clippings, leaves and other plant waste. The discharge from such mulcher-equipped mowers may be safely left on a lawn to provide fertilization. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,083,166; 4,189,903 and 3,797,212 all disclose various auxiliary mulching devices for use with rotary lawn mowers. U.S. Pat. No. 4,189,904 discloses a different design of mulcher wherein a blade bearing member at least partially blocks the outlet chute of a lawn mower restricting discharge of large size clippings. U.S. Pat. No. 4,205,510 describes a nonmulching lawn mower blade comprised of a squirrel cage fan and a number of radial cutters. Prior art mulching attachments have not enjoyed widespread use owing to a number of problems. Particular of the mulching attachments are large, complex items which can cause severe problems of vibration and generate excessive noise in the course of their use. Additionally, such mulcher attachments are fairly heavy, hard to install, difficult to resharpen and detract from the power of the lawn mower. Mulcher attachments of the type which block discharge chutes are very prone to clog with plant matter and this problem is greatly intensified if the plant matter is even slightly wet. What is needed is a mulching attachment which may be utilized in combination with a rotary lawn mower and which is simple to install and use, readily resharpened and/or replaced and which is lightweight and small in size so as to eliminate problems of installation, vibration and power loss. The present invention provides a mulcher attachment for lawn mowers which may be utilized to pulverize grass clippings, leaves and other such plant waste while the lawn is being mowed. The mulcher of the present invention is of a simple design, lightweight and readily installed on existing lawn mowers or it may be incorporated in newly constructed lawn mowers. The mulcher attachment is safe, easy to use and low in cost. These and other advantages of the present invention will be readily apparent from the drawings, discussion and description which follow. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION There is disclosed herein a mulching attachment for a lawn mower. The mulching attachment comprises a generally planar, disk-shaped member and fan means associated with the disc-shaped member for providing a radial flow of air thereacross. The mulching attachment further includes a generally cylindrical mulcher blade assembly disposed at approximate right angles to, and surrounding the periphery of, the disk. The blade assembly includes a plurality of blades circumferentially spaced thereabout and defining a plurality of spaces therebetween. In a particular embodiment, the fan means includes one or more planar vanes projecting from the plane of the disc and disposed along a portion of the radius thereof. The fan vanes may be formed from tabs punched from the disc and bent away from the plane thereof. In other embodiments, the mulcher blade assembly may comprise a cylindrical member having a plurality of blades projecting into the interior thereof. The blades may be formed by captive tab portions of the cylindrical wall of the mulcher blade assembly, which tab portions are bent inward. The mulching attachment may be configured as a two-part device wherein the disc-shaped member and the blade assembly are separate units configured to be fastened together and in one version of such embodiment, the blade assembly includes a flange configured to permit the blade assembly to be mounted to the disc-shaped member.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a light used for curing light-activated compound materials. In particular, the present invention relates to a curing light comprising two or more light sources whose outputs are integrally combined to produce a light spectrum suitable for curing a variety of light-activated compounds. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Light-activated compounds are well known and used in a variety of commercial applications. For example, such compounds are widely used in a variety of dental procedures including restoration work and teeth filling after root canals and other procedures requiring drilling. Several well-known dental compounds have been sold, for example, under the trade names of BRILLIANT LINE, Z-100, TPH, CHARISMA and HERCULITE &amp; BRODIGY. Dental compounds typically comprise liquid and powder components mixed together to form a paste. Curing of the compound requires the liquid component to evaporate, causing the composite to harden. In the past, curing has been accomplished by air drying, which has had the disadvantage of requiring significant time. This time can greatly inconvenience the patient. More recently, use of composite materials containing light-activated accelerators has become popular in the field of dentistry as a means for decreasing curing times. According to this trend, curing lights have been developed for dental curing applications. An example of such a curing light is illustrated by U.S. Pat. No. 5,975,895, issued Nov. 2, 1999 to Sullivan, which is hereby incorporated by reference. Conventional dental curing lights generally employ tungsten filament halogen lamps that incorporate a filament for generating light, a reflector for directing light and often a filter for limiting transmitted wavelengths. For example, a blue filter may be used to limit transmitted light to wavelengths in the region of 400 to 500 nanometers (nm). Light is typically directed from the filtered lamp to a light guide, which directs the light emanating from an application end of the guide to a position adjacent to the material to be cured. Filters are generally selected in accordance with the light activation properties of selected composite compound materials. For example, blue light may be found to be effective to excite composite accelerators such as camphoroquinine, which has a blue light absorption peak of approximately 470 nanometers (nm). Once excited, the camphoroquinine accelerator in turn stimulates the production of free radicals in a tertiary amine component of the composite, causing polymerization and hardening. An increasing number of light activated compounds are being developed using a variety of photo initiators with different light properties For example, orthodontic adhesives have been produced with a phenol propanedione accelerator that undergoes free radical production in the presence of green light having a light absorption peak of approximately 440 nm. In order to be effectively used with a variety of compounds, it would therefore be desirable to have a curing light capable of delivering light of several colors. As halogen lamps typically produce a broad light spectrum, these lights would seem to provide some advantage over other more monochromatic light sources, such as light emitting diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes (LDs). However, a problem with conventional halogen-based lights is that the lamp, filter and reflector degrade over time. This degradation is particularly accelerated, for example, by the significant heat generated by the halogen lamp. For example, this heat may cause filters to blister and cause reflectors to discolor, leading to reductions in light output and curing effectiveness. While heat may be dissipated by adding a fan unit to the light, the fan may cause other undesired effects (for example, undesirably dispersing a bacterial aerosol that may have been applied by the dentist to the patient&#39;s mouth). Alternate lamp technologies using Xenon and laser light sources have been investigated, but these technologies have tended to be costly, consumed large amounts of power and generated significant heat. Laser technologies have also required stringent safety precautions. LEDs and LDs appear to be good alternates to halogen curing light sources, having excellent cost and life characteristics. Generating little heat, they also present less risk of irritation or discomfort to the patient. However, LEDs and LDs individually tend to produce relatively monochromatic light energy. U.S. Pat. No. 6,331,111 to Cao discloses a curing light system incorporating a plurality of LEDs or LDs in a single curing light. The plurality of LEDs or LDs are located on a single heat sink to facilitate heat dissipation, and radiate light through a transparent focus dome or window toward a curing target. Cao notes that LEDs and LDs may be selected having different characteristic wavelengths in order to cure a variety of composite materials having photo initiators sensitive to these different characteristic wavelengths. However, Cao falls short of disclosing an efficient means for combining light energy from monochromatic light sources of a few colors in order to produce a broad, continuous spectrum of light energy for curing a variety of composite materials. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Limitations of the prior art are overcome by a novel curing light comprising a plurality of light sources each producing an incident light beam, and means for integrating the plurality of incident light beams into a single output light beam. In a first embodiment of the present invention, at least a first one of the light sources has a first characteristic wavelength and at least a second one of the light sources has a second characteristic wavelength, selected so that the output light beam exhibits an intensity that varies by no more than 25 percent over a range defined by the first and second characteristic wavelengths. This result may be achieved, for example, where the first one of the light sources has a first spectral width ending at an uppermost wavelength and the second one of the light sources has a second spectral width ending at a lowermost wavelength, by selecting the first and second light so that the uppermost wavelength of the first light source and the lowermost wavelength of the second light source are approximately coincident. In a second embodiment of the present invention, where at least one of the at least one of the light sources is a light emitting diode (LED) that produces an incident light beam characterized as blue, another light source is selected to be an LED that produces an incident light beam characterized as white, so that the output light beam contains a light component that is characterized as green. In a third embodiment of the present invention, the means for integrating the incident light beams comprises a plurality of fiber optic bundles, wherein a receiving end of each fiber optic bundle is arranged to receive an incident light beam from one of the plurality of light sources, and transmitting ends of fibers in each of the plurality of fiber optic bundles are randomly combined to form a single output surface for transmitting the output beam.",

    "abstract": "The present invention provides compositions having anti-plant virus activity and satisfying the foregoing criteria for successful anti-pathogenic materials. Anti-viral compositions according to the invention preferably comprise a glucose caramel combined with a physiologically acceptable diluent, adjuvant or carrier. More preferably, the compostions comprise a Type IV caramel, i.e., one derived from the reaction of ammonia, glucose and sulfide. A presently preferred caramel is available under the designation TB from the Amano Jitsugyo Company (Fukuyama, Hiroshima, Japan). The concentration of caramel in compositions of the present invention may range from 1 μg/ml to 50 mg/ml, with a particularly useful concentration being 10 μg/ml. A presently preferred diluent for caramel compositions is 0.1M phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. Caramel compositions according to the present invention are particularly useful in the treatment of plants susceptible to infection by or previously infected with cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Thus, both treatment to inhibit the infection of plants by CMV virus and treatment to inhibit the multiplication of the virus in infected plants are contemplated by the present invention. Treatment to inhibit other viruses and fungi is contemplated as well. The treatment of plants according to the invention may involve spraying a caramel composition on the leaves of plants, adding the composition to the water supply of the plants, or in the case of plants grown by tissue culture, adding the composition to the culture media. Treatment of both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous higher plants is contemplated. Other aspects and advantages of the present invention will be appreciated upon consideration of the following detailed description of presently preferred embodiments thereof. Caramel compositions were tested for their ability to inhibit the infection of dicotyledonous Vigna ungiculata subspecies sesquipedalis plants by CMV. CMV is RNA virus transmitted mainly by aphids, which causes serious disease in a wide variety of crops including, for example, tomato, cucumber, zucchini, muskmelon, sweet potato, sugar beet and tobacco. The virus is carried by perennial ornamental plants such as the violet and the gladiolus. CMV is a plant virus of worldwide economic significance. Infectivity Inhibition Assay A composition of 10 μg/ml caramel (TB Amano Jitsugyo Company) in 0.1M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 was prepared. A small calligraphy brush was used to apply a coat of the caramel composition to a first leaf of two-leaf Vigna unguiculata seedlings (Takii Seed Company, Kyoto, Japan), either two hours before infection of the seedlings with CMV [strain pepo obtained from the College of Agriculture, University of Osaka Prefecture, Osaka, Japan, and described in Annals of the Phytopathological Society of Japan, 44, 619-625 (1978)], contemporaneously to infection, or two hours after infection. Control seedlings were either totally untreated or treated only with 0.1M phosphate buffer pH 7.0 on a first leaf. The composition was applied to the front of the leaf of some seedlings and the back of the leaf of others. The second leaf of both the treated and control seedlings was not treated with the caramel composition or with buffer. The front of both leaves of both the treated and control seedlings was then infected with CMV by a method similar to that described in Kopp et al., supra. Leaves were inoculated with virus by abrasion of the leaf surface in the presence of a suspension containing purified CMV. The infected seedlings were cultivated in a controlled environment at 25° C. for 3 days to allow the infection to develop. The number of infectious spots, equivalent to viral plaques, was then counted for each leaf of each seedling. The results of the assay are presented below in Table 1, wherein each number of infectious spots for treated and untreated leaves represents the average of the numbers of infectious spots obtained for ten seedlings. Totally untreated control seedlings displayed more than 250 infectious spots per leaf.",

    "abstract": "The present invention is directed to a snowboard boot which allows the rider to apply maximum propulsive force to the snowboard without interfering with the natural movement of the ankle. In one embodiment of the present invention, a snowboard boot includes a heel member and a leg member positioned above the heel member. The heel member and the leg member are secured to the boot so that the leg member is capable of movement relative to the heel member about an axis of rotation that is vertically inclined no more than ±45° and that lies within a plane that is inclined relative to a longitudinal plane which divides left and right sections of the boot. In other words, a snowboard boot which has general lateral symmetry is designed to pivot around an axis which intersects the plane of symmetry. As noted above, tilting motion of the ankle in the lateral direction is facilitated when it is accompanied by tilting motion in the longitudinal direction. Due to the aforementioned three-dimensional structure of the ankle, pivoting motion in a pivoting plane which is inclined with respect to the vertical plane in which the axis of the anklebone lies is easier than pivoting motion in the vertical plane in which the axis of the anklebone lies. Thus, the tilting design which pertains to the present invention is consistent with the three-dimensional arch structure of the ankle. When the snowboard boot is attached such that it is inclined diagonally with respect to the major axis of the snowboard, i.e., to the direction of travel, pivoting motion of the foot in the diagonal direction provides propulsive force in the direction of travel to the snowboard boot. Since the rotational force (the component force which acts so as to rotate the snowboard) is zero or very small in this case, the loss in propulsive force produced by the foot acting on the snowboard is minimized, and this propulsive force therefore has high propulsive efficiency. This high propulsive efficiency is useful in piping competitions.

    "abstract": "The present invention is a system for the detection of cardiac events (a guardian system) that includes a device called a cardiosaver, a physician&#39;s programmer and an external alarm system. The present invention envisions a system for early detection of an acute myocardial infarction or exercise induced myocardial ischemia caused by an increased heart rate or exertion. In the preferred embodiment of the present invention, the cardiosaver is implanted along with the electrodes. In an alternate embodiment, the cardiosaver and the electrodes could be external but attached to the patient&#39;s body. Although the following descriptions of the present invention in most cases refer to the preferred embodiment of an implanted cardiosaver processing electrogram data from implanted electrodes, the techniques described are equally applicable to the alternate embodiment where the external cardiosaver processes electrocardiogram data from skin surface electrodes. In the preferred embodiment of the cardiosaver either or both subcutaneous electrodes or electrodes located on a pacemaker type right ventricular or atrial leads will be used. It is also envisioned that one or more electrodes may be placed within the superior vena cava. One version of the implanted cardiosaver device using subcutaneous electrodes would have an electrode located under the skin on the patient&#39;s left side. This could be best located between 2 and 20 inches below the patient&#39;s left arm pit. The cardiosaver case that would act as the indifferent electrode would typically be implanted like a pacemaker under the skin on the left side of the patient&#39;s chest. Using one or more detection algorithms, the cardiosaver can detect a change in the patient&#39;s electrogram that is indicative of a cardiac event, such as an acute myocardial infarction, within five minutes after it occurs and then automatically warn the patient that the event is occurring. To provide this warning, the guardian system includes an internal alarm sub-system (internal alarm means) within the cardiosaver and/or an external alarm system (external alarm means). In the preferred, implanted embodiment, the cardiosaver communicates with the external alarm system using a wireless radio-frequency (RF) signal. The internal alarm means generates an internal alarm signal to warn the patient. The internal alarm signal may be a mechanical vibration, a sound or a subcutaneous electrical tickle. The external alarm system (external alarm means) will generate an external alarm signal to warn the patient. The external alarm signal is typically a sound that can be used alone or in combination with the internal alarm signal. The internal or external alarm signals would be used to alert the patient to at least two different types of conditions: a major event alarm signaling the detection of a major cardiac event (e.g. a heart attack) and the need for immediate medical attention, and a less critical “SEE DOCTOR” alarm signaling the detection of a less serious non life threatening condition such as exercise induced ischemia. The SEE DOCTOR alarm signal would be used to tell the patient that he is not in immediate danger but should arrange an appointment with his doctor in the near future. In addition to the signaling of less critical cardiac events, the SEE DOCTOR alarm signal could also signal the patient when the cardiosaver battery is getting low. In the preferred embodiment, in a major event alarm the internal alarm signal would be applied periodically, for example, with three pulses every 5 seconds after the detection of a major cardiac event. It is also envisioned that the less critical “SEE DOCTOR” alarm, would be signaled in a different way, such as one pulse every 7 seconds. The external alarm system is a hand-held portable device that may include any or all the following features: 1. an external alarm means to generate an external alarm signal to alert the patient. 2. the capability to receive cardiac event alarm, recorded electrogram and other data from the cardiosaver 3. the capability to transmit the cardiac event alarm, recorded electrogram and other data collected by the cardiosaver to a medical practitioner at a remote location. 4. an “alarm-off” button that when depressed can acknowledge that the patient is aware of the alarm and will turn off internal and external alarm signals. 5. a display (typically an LCD panel) to provide information and/or instructions to the patient by a text message and the display of segments of the patient&#39;s electrogram. 6. the ability to provide messages including instructions to the patient via a pre-recorded human voice. 7. a patient initiated electrogram capture initiated by a “Panic Button” to allow the patient, even when there has been no alarm, to initiate transmission of electrogram data from the cardiosaver to the external alarm system for transmission to a medical practitioner. 8. a patient initiated electrogram capture to initiate transmission of electrogram data from the cardiosaver to the external alarm system for display to a medical practitioner using the display on the external alarm system. 9. the capability to automatically turn the internal and external alarms off after a reasonable time period that is typically less than 30 minutes if the alarm-off button is not used. Text and/or spoken instructions may include a message that the patient should promptly take some predetermined medication such as chewing an aspirin, placing a nitroglycerine tablet under his tongue, inhaling or nasal spraying a single or multiple drug combination and/or injecting thrombolytic drugs into a subcutaneous drug port. The messaging displayed by or spoken from the external alarm system and/or a phone call from a medical practitioner who receives the alarm could also inform the patient that he should wait for the arrival of emergency medical services or he should promptly proceed to an emergency medical facility. It is envisioned that the external alarm system can have direct connection to a telephone line and/or work through cell phone or other wireless networks. If a patient seeks care in an emergency room, the external alarm system could provide a display to the medical practitioners in the emergency room of both the electrogram segment that caused the alarm and the baseline electrogram segment against which the electrogram that caused the alarm was compared. The ability to display both baseline and alarm electrogram segments will significantly improve the ability of the emergency room physician to properly identify AMI. The preferred embodiment of the external alarm system consists of an external alarm transceiver and a handheld computer. The external alarm transceiver having a standardized interface, such as Compact Flash adapter interface, a secure digital (SD) card interface, a multi-media card interface, a memory stick interface or a PCMCIA card interface. The standardized interface will allow the external alarm transceiver to connect into a similar standardized interface slot that is present in many handheld computers such as a Palm Pilot or Pocket PC. An advantage of this embodiment is that the handheld computer can cost effectively supply the capability for text and graphics display and for playing spoken messages. Using a handheld computer, such as the Thera™ by Audiovox™ that combines a Pocket PC with having an SD/Multimedia interface slot with a cell phone having wireless internet access, is a solution that can easily be programmed to provide communication between the external alarm system and a diagnostic center staffed with medical practitioners.",
    "full_text": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n     Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. A heart attack (also known as an Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI)) typically results from a thrombus that obstructs blood flow in one or more coronary arteries. AMI is a common and life-threatening complication of coronary heart disease. The sooner that perfusion of the myocardium is restored (e.g., with injection of a thrombolytic medication such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)), the better the prognosis and survival of the patient from the heart attack. The extent of damage to the myocardium is strongly dependent upon the length of time prior to restoration of blood flow to the heart muscle. \n     Myocardial ischemia is caused by a temporary imbalance of blood (oxygen) supply and demand in the heart muscle. It is typically provoked by physical activity or other causes of increased heart rate when one or more of the coronary arteries are obstructed by atherosclerosis. Patients wi...",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to an endotoxin-adsorbent for preventing and treating autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, by removing endotoxin in the gastrointestinal tract. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of the outer cell membrane of gram-negative bacteria, is known as endotoxin; and the lipid A component is the fatal toxic domain of LPS (Microbiology. David B D, Dulbecco R, Eisen E N, Harold S, Ginsberg H S, Barry W A. Harper International Edition 615-617, 1970). Endotoxin has a variety of physiological and pathological effects and causes endotoxin shock in animals within one hour if enough amounts of LPS were injected. Since it causes fever even at low dose, it is also known as a pyrogen. Therefore, the contamination of endotoxin in medical products such as injection products used as a non-oral administration is strictly prevented. Since large numbers of a variety of gram-negative microorganisms, such as  E. coli , invariably reside in the gastrointestinal tract of animals and humans, a large amount of endotoxin consistently is present in the gastrointestinal tract. However, animals and humans do not suffer a fever in general, indicating that endotoxin is barely absorbed from intestinal walls due to its large molecular size or due to mucosal immune barrier systems such as the IgA antibody barrier on intestinal walls. The immune system is one of the major self-defense systems for a host to keep homeostasis by recognizing and preventing the invasion of foreign substances such as microorganisms as well as the growth of abnormal cells such as cancer cells, and by excluding them from the body. However, once this system is destroyed for unknown reasons, the immune system starts to attack self-components, and as a consequence, induces a variety of intractable diseases, so called “autoimmune diseases”. The following diseases are known as autoimmune diseases: rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, autoimmune nephritis, autoimmune labyrinthitis, autoimmune encephalomyelitis, autoimmune chronic thyroiditis, type I diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus, polydermatomyositis, psoriasis, Sjorgren syndrome, ulcerative colitis, Crohn&#39;s disease, and Guillain-Barre syndrome. Rheumatoid arthritis is an example of a typical autoimmune disease. Since large numbers of patients suffer this painful disease and their quality of life in society is interfered with by their limited function, this disease has been given a lot of social attention. The majority of patients with rheumatoid arthritis are forced to be confined to bed rest as the progress of arthritis, such as articular destruction, joint deformity, mobility impairment and pain increases. Currently, autoimmune diseases are treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-inflammatory steroids, immune suppressants, and anti-cytokine antibodies such as Remicade. These therapeutic agents only suppress abnormal immune systems and inflammatory reactions, and are used to target specific symptoms, but not intended to cure the disease. Although several hypotheses for the causes of rheumatoid arthritis have been proposed, the etiology and the pathology of this disease remain unknown. Based on the analysis of auto-antibodies in sera and cartilages from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, we have reached a hypothesis that the chronic abnormal absorption of mimic antigens and bacterial toxins from the gastrointestinal tract due to increased mucosal permeability is the fundamental, common disorder of autoimmune diseases. This hypothesis was proved by the following arthritis models in experimental animals. We administered purified heterologous type II collagen with and without the use of LPS to mice by the oral route, and successfully induced three types of chronic arthritis in mice. Most importantly, bacterial toxins, such as endotoxin, are not only capable of disturbing immune homeostasis by stimulating host immune systems non-specifically, but also capable of inducing inflammatory diseases such as arthritis. Based on these observations, the inventors of this invention focused on the pathogenic roles of LPS, which is a dominant bacterial toxin produced by intestinal flora in large quantities, and reached a hypothesis that autoimmune diseases could be prevented and treated by blocking the absorption of excess amounts of LPS from the gastrointestinal tract by using an endotoxin-adsorbent. To begin, mice were administered chick type II collagen by the oral route for more than 10 weeks. Mice developed antibodies to chick type II collagen, which cross-reacts to autologous type II collagen, and as a consequence, mice developed clinically apparent arthritis (Terato K, Ye X Y, Miyahara H, Cremer M A, and Grifiths M M. Induction of auto-immune arthritis in DBA/l mice by oral administration of type II collagen. Br. J. Rheum. 35:828-838, 1996). Since autoantibodies to cartilage are not always capable of inducing arthritis in experimental animals and humans, it was assumed that a secondary factor(s) is involved in the induction of arthritis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Although a variety of bacterial toxins are considered as a potential secondary pathogenic factor, it is most likely that endotoxin will play the dominant pathological role in the majority of patients with autoimmune diseases, because endotoxin is the most widely and commonly existing at high levels in the gastrointestinal tract. In order to test this possibility, mice were injected with a non-arthritogenic dose of monoclonal anti-type II collagen antibody cocktail and then received LPS by IP and oral route. The control mice receiving anti-type II collagen antibody alone did not develop arthritis, whereas, both groups of mice receiving LPS by IP and by oral administration developed severe arthritis, indicating that environmental factors such as LPS play important pathological roles in autoimmune diseases (Terato K, Harper D S, Griffiths M M, Hasty I D A, Ye X Y, Cremer M A and Seyer J S. Collagen-induced arthritis: Synergistic effect of  E. coli  lipopolysaccharide bypass epitope specificity in the induction of arthritis with monoclonal antibodies to type II collagen. Autoimmunity 22:137-147, 1995). It has been known that endotoxin is not only involved in rheumatoid arthritis but also involved in a variety of autoimmune diseases such as autoimmune encephalomyelitis (Nagai A et al. J. Immunol. 175:959-966, 2005), lupus lung injury (Chae B S et al. Arch Pharm Res 29:302-309, 2006), autoimmune thyroiditis (Damotte I D et al. Fur Cytokine Netw 14:52-59, 2003), primary biliary liver cirrhosis (Ballet E et al. J. Autoimmun 22:153-158, 2004), and Guillain-Barre syndrome (Yuki N et al. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 101:11404-11409, 2004). The inventors of this invention have shown previously that oral administration of anti-LPS antibodies effectively suppressed the development of arthritis in this arthritis model (JP-A2006-151914). This evidence suggests strongly that the removal of endotoxin from the gastrointestinal tract is one of the best strategies for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. There are a variety of difficulties in mass-producing an antibody for medical use, in addition to the high production cost. Antibody, which is a protein, is heat labile, and tends to lose biological activity during processing. Furthermore, an antibody administered by the oral route will be less effective because of its degradation by digestion enzymes in the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, it is desired to develop a new and effective endotoxin antagonist which is heat-stable, easy to mass-produce at a low cost and safe for humans. The contamination of endotoxin in injectable products must be removed completely, since even a minor contaminant of endotoxin induces adverse effects such as fever in patients. In order to remove endotoxin from medical products, several adsorbents specific to endotoxin have been used. Synthetic fibers, fabrics and particles covalently bound by a substance that has a high binding affinity to endotoxin, have been used. By contacting these adsorbents with an objective solution, endotoxin contaminated in the solution can be removed effectively. Several endotoxin-adsorbents, such as Affi-Prep Polymixin (BioRad, USA) and Toraymyxin (Toray Medicals, Japan), JP-A 11-335396 and JP-A 2002-263486, are currently used to remove endotoxin contaminated in injectable products and others. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a non-digestible and non-absorbable endotoxin-adsorbent, used for oral administration, comprising particles in which not more than 1% have a diameter of not more than 5 μm, and more than 90% of the particles have a diameter of not more than 50 μm, based on a volume-based size distribution analysis. Furthermore, this invention also provides a formulation of the endotoxin-adsorbent or an agent for preventing and treating autoimmune diseases, a method for prevention and treatment of patients with autoimmune diseases by administering the endotoxin-adsorbent, and methods for the manufacture of endotoxin-adsorbents used for the prevention and treatment of autoimmune diseases.",

    "abstract": "The present invention is an automatic substance applicator system that can be used to apply a predetermined amount of substance to a receiving surface in a steady and controlled way, optionally at pre-selected intervals. For example, the automatic substance applicator system could be used to automatically apply nail polish to fingernails, or drugs to a skin surface or subcutaneously. The automatic substance applicator system can include, but is not limited to, a controller having switches to control such features as, for example, power, pump speed, and applicator motor speed. The controller can optionally provide switches to control an identification means such as, for example, a biosensor, an adjustable dosage meter, and a timer. The pump can draw or push a substance from a reservoir and supply the substance to an applicator such as, for example, a brush, a sponge, a nozzle, or combinations thereof, possibly through tubing. The applicator can be connected to a positioning or alignment device, and actuator such as a servo motor, which can adjust the position of the applicator, thereby automatically distributing the substance across the receiving surface. The biosensor or identification means can determine the identity of the person to whom the substance will be applied, the timer can provide the substance at pre-selected intervals, and the dosage meter can provide a pre-determined amount of substance. The applicator system can include an applicator that is removable to accommodate a variety of different applicator head shapes, sizes, and uses. The controller can optionally have an electronic connection, wired or wireless, that allows remote control of dosage amount and timing. For example, medical personnel could establish the dosage and timing through an internet connection and the controller could automatically adjust its parameters according to the instructions from the medical personnel. The user could be informed of any external interaction with medical personnel through a wired or wireless personal device, for example, a Personal Data Assistant (PDA), a Personal Computer (PC), or a display associated with the controller or actuator. Additionally, the controller could be geographically separate from the applicator and could send and receive wireless electronic signals to control the pump and actuator and to send/receive signals to/from the identification means. The controller can include sensors including, but not limited to, for example, a position sensor, an angle sensor, and a pump sensor.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to the automated handling of cartons in warehouses and distribution centers and, more particularly, to the automated removal of the cartons from load bearing trays. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Current industry practice to remove cartons automatically from trays utilizes one of two types of designs. The first design involves stopping the tray, lifting the carton up on fingers and raking the carton off the fingers. This design requires the tray to come to a stop thereby limiting the potential throughput rate. In this design, a single tray removal device can have the ability to process multiple tray sizes but imposes certain limitations to the number of sizes of trays that can be processed by a single tray removal device. It also at times imposes additional limitations on the orientation of trays with regard to the side or dimension of the tray that first approaches the tray removal device. A second design is characterized by previous attempts to utilize a continuous process involving a “scraping” type device to lift the carton up and onto a powered belt. This design requires a grid of raised platforms on the bottom of the tray. The platforms form an elevated surface upon which the carton can rest. The fingers of the scraping device reach between the platforms and under the elevated carton. As the tray moves on the powered belt, the back lip of the tray drives the carton up the inclined scraper surface formed by the assembly of fingers and onto a powered belt. This design requires significantly increased vertical height in the tray design, resulting in the tray itself occupying a significant amount of space in the storage facility. It also requires the use of relatively uniform size cartons to allow the back edge of the tray to drive the carton far enough up the inclined surface to engage the powered takeaway conveyor. This design also is limited in that each tray removal device can process only one size tray thus requiring multiple devices as a means to process multiple tray sizes. The cartons handled by automated systems can vary in size, therefore it is a goal of carton removal systems to provide and use trays that are of a size that will contain the carton but are no larger than necessary to do so. To the degree that the tray is larger than the carton, some space in the storage facility may be wasted. In these applications a wide variety of carton sizes are used. In order to maximize the utilization of the storage volume, multiple tray sizes are required. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one aspect of the invention, there is provided an apparatus and method for removing cartons from load bearing trays as the trays move continuously on a generally planar conveyor surface. The sizes of trays may be chosen to accommodate most efficiently the sizes of the individual cartons. The carton removal apparatus can act on the trays and their contents without regard to the size of the tray and without regard to the fore and aft orientation of the trays such that either end of the tray may approach the carton removal apparatus first. The tray provides a means for the apparatus to insert a multiplicity of acutely sloping wedges/fingers into generally vertical slots in the leading edge side of the advancing tray, the slots extending upward through the top edge of the tray side wall and downward to join with recessed grooves in the bottom surface of the tray. The wedges are positioned such that they insert between the bottom surface of the carton and the tray surface on which the carton rests, thereby lifting the front edge of the advancing carton onto the upper surfaces of the wedges. In an exemplary embodiment, the planar upper surface of each wedge joins with, is aligned with, and is continued by, a moving conveyor belt of generally the same width as the upper surface of the individual wedge. The forward motion of the tray pushes the carton onto the upper surface of the wedges to a point at which the bottom surface of the carton comes in contact with the multiplicity of moving conveyor belts which then support the carton and move it forward, generally independent of the motion of the tray. The carton is supported by and transported by the multiplicity of conveyor belts and is thus separated from the tray. The carton, now removed from the tray, continues its motion onto a conveyor surface that adjoins the conveyor belts of the carton removal apparatus. Another aspect of the invention involves a system having a plurality of trays, each comprising a base and a pair of end walls extending upward from the base. The system includes a tray unloading system. The trays are of a plurality of different widths. The tray unloading system comprises a plurality of fingers. Each of the end walls comprises a plurality of vertical slots open to an upper edge of the end wall. The fingers are positioned in dimension to pass through the slots of the trays as the trays are delivered to lift contents of the trays. The fingers are positioned so that some fingers pass through the slots of each of the different tray widths but others pass only through slots of wider said tray widths. In various implementations, the fingers may be positioned at an essentially non-constant spacing effective to accommodate the different widths. The fingers may be laterally asymmetrically positioned. The non-constant spacing may comprise: a first group at a non-constant first on-center pitch; and a plurality of additional fingers separated from the first group by one or more gaps. The plurality of additional fingers may comprise a single intermediate finger separated from the first group by a first gap at an on-center dimension other than a multiple of said first on-center pitch and at least two more fingers separated from the intermediate finger by a second gap at an on-center dimension other than a multiple of said first on-center pitch. The first group may consist of five fingers. The at least two additional fingers may consist of said two additional fingers at said first on-center pitch. The fingers each may comprise a tip member and a conveyor and may be positioned to guide the contents to a tray content removal conveyor. The finger conveyors may be powered in common by a motor. Further aspects involve the method for operating such a system. A tray delivery conveyor is driven to move the trays downstream to the transfer system. At least some of the fingers are passed through the slots of the trays as the trays are delivered by a tray delivery conveyor. The passing includes passing the tip members through a leading one of the end walls of each tray and passing the tip members into grooves in the base of each tray and below the contents, a wedging action of the tip members providing an initial said lift of the contents of the trays. The contents are passed along the fingers to the finger conveyors. The finger conveyors are driven to transfer the contents to a tray content removal conveyor. The tray content removal conveyor is driven to further transport the contents. A trailing one of the end walls may push the contents up the tip portions or notches in a tray base may do so. The fingers may pass inside-to-outside through the trailing end wall. There may be a plurality of different widths of the trays. A partially different group of the fingers may pass through the slots respectively of the trays of different widths. The different tray widths may include at least first, second, and third widths. The fingers may be positioned at a spacing effective to accommodate the different widths as firsts of the first side walls of the trays pass in a predetermined alignment with a first edge of the conveyor so that: the first width is accommodated by a first terminal group of the fingers passing through associated ones of the slots with the second side wall passing through a first gap between the first terminal group and a remainder of the fingers; the second width is accommodated by the first terminal group of the fingers and at least one of the remainder passing through associated ones of the slots with the second side wall passing through a second gap between the at least one of the remainder and remaining fingers of the remainder; and the third width is accommodated by the first terminal group of the fingers and at least two of the remainder passing through associated ones of the slots. Further aspects of the invention involve trays. Each tray comprises a base and a pair of end walls extending upward from the base. The base includes an upper surface having a plurality of interspersed longitudinal grooves and ridges. Each of the end walls comprises a plurality of vertical slots open to an upper edge of the end wall and respectively aligned with an associated said groove. There may be at least two distinct lateral sizes of the slots and grooves. In various implementations, the tray may be a nineteen inch wide tray having exactly seven said slots and grooves or the tray may be a twenty-six inch wide tray having exactly ten said slots and grooves. The tray may have exactly seven said slots, a central group of three of the slots having larger slot width than the two terminal pairs of two slots or the tray may have exactly ten said slots and grooves, two terminal groups of three slots having slot width less than the respective adjacent slots separating the two terminal groups from a central pair of slots. Such a system may have one or more of the following advantages. One advantage is the ability to remove the carton from the tray while the tray remains in motion, thereby removing a greater number of cartons in a specific period of time.   Another advantage is the ability to use a greater variety of tray sizes than previous systems, each tray being chosen to fit most closely the carton that is placed on it, thereby making more efficient use of space within the storage facility.   Another advantage is the reduction in the thickness, or vertical height, of the bottom surface of the tray, such that the tray occupies a minimum of space beyond that which is required to contain the carton, thus making more storage space within the storage facility available for storage of cartons.   Another advantage is the ability to handle multiple trays sizes in a single apparatus, thereby possibly reducing the number of devices required.   Another advantage is an improved method of stacking empty trays on each other whereby the space required within the storage facility for the storage of empty trays is reduced.   Another advantage is a process for automatic, unattended removal of cartons from a plurality of predetermined tray sizes, wherein the movement of the trays is continuous and without interruption, by a single carton removal apparatus.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to the treatment of Lymes disease and associated debilitating conditions using photoactivateable compounds such as psoralens and activating electromagnetic radiation to engender a therapeutic immune response. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Lymes disease is caused by a tick-borne spirochete. Early symptoms of Lymes disease which appear in weeks to months following initial infection include meningitis, facial palsy and migratory muscular-skeletal pain. Later appearing symptoms which can occur months to years after initial infection include chronic arthritis, encephalopathy, polyneuropathopy and leukoencephalitis. The usual therapy for Lymes disease is a 10-20 day course of antibiotics which must be implemented during the early stages of infection in order to have any appreciable expectation of success. However, even with early intervention, in a small percentage of patients the antibiotic therapy will be ineffective. This is particularly so if the spirochete has spread to the patient&#39;s nervous system. Untreated patients, patients who did not receive antibiotic therapy early enough, or the small percentage of patients who did receive antibiotic therapy but nevertheless failed to respond, will generally experience the symptoms noted above as well as disturbances of memory, mood or sleep, axonal polyneuropathy with paresthesias or spinal pain. Typically, patients, particularly initially untreated patients, may also experience large knee effusions. The foregoing conditions associated with Lymes disease generally cannot be alleviated by late intervention with antibiotics. Fortunately, it has now been discovered that untreated symptomatic patients as well as patients who received antibiotic therapy for Lymes disease but failed to respond, can be effectively treated using the photopheresis methods described below. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention a method has been found for treating patients who are afflicted with Lymes disease and associated debilitating conditions using a photoactive compound that binds to nucleic acid upon activation by exposure to electromagnetic radiation of a prescribed spectrum, such as ultraviolet light. Psoralen compounds are particularly preferred for this purpose, especially the compound 8-methoxypsoralen--in which case UVA radiation is preferred for activating said compound. In accordance with the invention, a photoactive compound such as 8-methoxypsoralen is administered to the patient&#39;s blood, or some fraction thereof, in vitro or in vivo using conventional administration routes. A portion of the patient&#39;s blood is then treated (preferably, extracorporeally) using photopheresis, which comprises subjecting the blood to electromagnetic radiation in such wavelengths suitable for activating the photoactive compound, such as ultraviolet light, preferably long wavelength ultraviolet light in the wavelength range of 320 to 400 nm, commonly called UVA light. The treated blood, or a fraction thereof, is returned to the patient (in the case of extracorporeal photopheresis) or remains in the patient (following in vivo photopheresis).",

    "abstract": "Shag rug brushing and object retrieving device. 2. Description of the Prior Art In the past few years shag rugs have become increasingly popular as floor coverings. Such rugs, due to the long strands forming the nap thereof, have the disadvantage that the strands become matted and entangled, and also small objects such as bobby pins, hairpins, and the like, drop onto the rug to become concealed within the nap thereof. If such objects are not removed, they will cut the strands of the nap, due to the abrasive action thereof as persons walk over the rug and force the objects into pressure contact with the strands. Prior to the present invention there has been no lightweight, easily usable device, which when moved over a shag rug will concurrently brush and fluff up the strands thereof, as well as remove small magnetically attractable objects from the rug. The primary object in devising the present invention is to supply a lightweight device that may be easily and conveniently rolled over a shag rug to brush and fluff the strands of the nap thereof, and concurrently remove small magnetically attractable objects from the nap of the rug to prevent such objects from cutting the strands when brought into pressure contact therewith as occurs when persons walk over the rug. Another object of the invention is to supply a device in which at least the major portion of the components thereof may be formed by injection molding from a polymerized resin, and as a result the device is not only durable but of light weight and easily moved from room to room as required. A still further object of the invention is to furnish a device that has a relatively simple mechanical structure, requires a minimum of maintenance attention, and when not in use, may be disposed in a position to occupy a minimum of storage space. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A shag rug brushing and raking device that concurrently with the use thereof for that purpose, retrieves small magnetically attractable objects such as hairpins, bobby pins, and the like, that tend to remain concealed within the deep pile of the rug. The device includes a first wheel-supported assembly that is moved over the rug by an elongate handle which forms a part thereof. The first assembly serves to rotatably support a second assembly. The second assembly includes at least one pair of longitudinally spaced end cap retainers that are rotatably supported on a horizontal shaft forming a part of the first assembly. The end cap retainers have a number of longitudinally aligned and circumferentially spaced pins thereon which extend towards one another. The pins pivotally support a number of strips in side-by-side relationship to encircle the shaft. The strips have a number of prongs extending outwardly therefrom that are of such length as to frictionally engage the nap of the rug when in their lowermost positions. As the prongs so engage the nap of the rug, the long strands thereof are brushed and raked. The strips and prongs tend to be held in a first angular relationship by spring means forming a part of the second assembly. However, if prongs when in the lowermost position engage strands which are entangled to a degree that they are not easily separated, the strip that supports the prongs may pivot against the bias of the spring means to a second relationship with the balance of the strip. Prongs on the strip when the latter is in a second relationship are angularly disposed relative to the rug and may slip out of engagement with the entangled strands without damaging the latter. The prongs, in addition to serving the above described function of brushing and raking the rug, also act as carriers for permanent magnetic means that retrieve small magnetically attractable objects such as hairpins or the like that would otherwise remain buried within the deep pile of the rug. The handle on the first assembly is pivotally adjustable relative thereto, and when the device is not in use the handle may be pivoted to a position substantially parallel to the shaft to permit the device to be stored in a minimum of space. The device above described is, in the main, capable of having the components thereof injection molded from a suitable polymerized resin, such as polyethylene or polyproplyene. By the use of such injection molded components, the weight of the device is minimized to permit the easy carrying thereof from one room to another for use in brushing and raking a shag rug, as well as retrieving magnetically retractable objects therefrom.",

    "abstract": "It is an object of the invention to provide an improved injection molding machine of the above-outlined type in which all requirements occurring in practice and involving the making of plastic components of different configuration and size and the use of plastic materials of different physical properties may be taken into account and further, the basic conditions for an automation of the conversion of the injection molding unit into the desired working positions can be effected with a relatively modest technological input. This object and others to become apparent as the specification progresses, are accomplished by the invention, according to which, briefly stated, the stationary mold carrier has, at its reverse side, parts defining guide grooves oriented transversely to the central and off-center injection axes. Further, a driving arrangement includes hydraulic power cylinders arranged symmetrically to the central and off-center injection axes. Each hydraulic power cylinder has a piston rod on which the injection molding unit is supported. Each piston rod has a coupling terminus received in a respective guide groove for guiding the respective piston rod therein during motion of the injection molding unit between working positions. The coupling terminus of each said piston rod is prevented by the respective guide groove from moving in a direction parallel to a longitudinal axis of the respective piston rod, whereby the piston rods are axially immobilized. Each hydraulic power cylinder has an axis lying in a single common plane which is inclined at an oblique angle to the horizontal. The transposing mechanism comprises a platform on which the piston rods --and thus the injection molding unit --are supported by a support member. In an arrangement according to the invention, by virtue of a positioning of the drive cylinders symmetrically with respect to the injection axis, the height of the shifting structure is significantly reduced. Furthermore, the appearance of tilting torques in such a design is avoided and inaccuracies of positioning the nozzle at the injection opening of the mold assembly are permanently reduced even in case of a significantly off-center injection and in case of nozzles which have no self-centering means. The ready longitudinal guidance of the coupling terminus of each piston rod in the grooves of the mold carrier is advantageous in that the injection molding unit is ready to perform a parallel shift (for assuming another working position) as soon as the pressing force on the nozzle during injection of the synthetic material is removed and thus the piston rods are no longer immobilized for shifting motion in the grooves of the mold carrier. Such a sliding support of the piston rods in the mold carrier cooperates, according to the invention, with a support of the piston rods by means of a support member on the platform which carries the injection molding unit. In a structural arrangement according to the invention as outlined above, the injection opening of the additional (second) injection mold assembly is oriented parallel to the injection opening of the first injection mold assembly and merges, as in the &#34;linear injection&#34;, laterally into the injection mold cavity which is oriented approximately symmetrically to the central axis. Contrary to the &#34;linear injection&#34;, however, the introduced synthetic material is, upon its entrance into the mold cavity at its wall at the edge zones, deflected in the direction of the center of the mold cavity while a desired turbulence is achieved. The mold cavity is, in turn, arranged with high precision symmetrically to the central axis of the injection mold assembly in order to ensure that the mold separating forces are substantially symmetrical to the central axis. Such an asymmetrical injection which is parallel to the central injection axis fulfills all the functions of the conventional &#34;linear injection&#34; in that there is feasible an arrangement of the injection mold cavity symmetrically to the central axis of the injection mold assembly to thus ensure a similar arrangement of the mold separating forces. The injection molding unit, for the selective use of different injection mold assemblies, may be set onto the desired injection opening by a simple displacement parallel to itself. Based on such a parallel shift, the mechanism for transposing the injection molding unit into further working positions may be simplified, while only a space for the injection molding machine is needed, particularly, when such a shift is effected in a horizontal or a vertical direction. According to a further feature of the invention, all off-center injection axes lie in the transposing plane parallel to the central axis and are situated on the same side of the transposing plane relative to the central axis. Further, the guide grooves which are formed in the stationary mold carrier are open to allow travel of the coupling terminus of each piston rod out of the guide grooves to thus permit a complete removal of the injection molding unit from the stationary mold carrier in a direction parallel to the central injection axis. By virtue of these features, the optimal conditions for an emptying injection of the injection molding unit after termination of the injection process are provided which is needed for each change of plastic material without the requirement of additional means such as conventional cooling plates. The parallel shift provides the possibility of an emptying injection stroke of the plasticizing cylinder for the required material change in the other working position of the injection molding unit without significant technological input. The cleaning of the plasticizing cylinder by the emptying injection stroke may be readily program-controlled because such an emptying stroke generally corresponds to a normal injection cycle. According to a further feature of the invention, the basic conditions are provided for a programmable &#34;removing position&#34; in which the plasticizing cylinder may be axially pulled off the injection molding unit as the latter has been pivoted to a maximum angle. Further, the injection molding unit may be set in a programmable &#34;material ejecting position&#34;in which the injection molding unit may be voided of the plastic material by expelling the same as if performing injection, for changing the plastic material. Such expelled synthetic material, as it engages the cooled rearward surface of the mold carrier, hardens and drops off and may be readily carried away. The particular manner in which guide columns of the transposing device are supported on the machine bed according to a further feature of the invention makes possible a simple retrofitting of an injection molding machine with the shifting (transposing) device provided as a structural unit since such unit may be installed on or removed from the machine bed with a few simple manipulations. As concerns the concept of &#34;additional working positions&#34;for &#34;non-central&#34; injection axes, the following additional observations are made: In seeking to achieve an optimal flow condition for a predetermined article to be made with a mold assembly having a central injection opening, one may find, for example, that such an optimum condition can be achieved if the injection opening is situated only slightly off the central injection axis. In such a case the synthetic material is introduced not at the edge of the injection mold cavity but is admitted into the central zone thereof. Within the meaning of the invention this involves a &#34;further working position&#34; with a non-central injection axis. Thus, injections may be effected which only depart slightly from a central injection. It is known by itself to set a horizontal injection molding unit by means of a hoisting frame vertically onto the parting plane of an injection molding assembly which may be clamped in different heights into a vertical mold closing unit, as disclosed in German Offenlegungsschrift (non-examined published application) No. 2,156,843. It is further known, for example, from European published patent Application No. 138,169 to shift two injection molding units which are arranged side-by-side horizontally on a machine bed in order to inject selectively different synthetic materials into an injection mold assembly held in a horizontal mold closing unit.",

The invention provides a compact packer wheel pressure adjustment assembly having an adjustment arm that can be rotated to one of multiple positions to change the amount of packing pressure exerted by the packer wheel. The adjustment arm interfaces with a biasing member, such as a spring, that adjusts the amount of packer wheel pressure as a function of the position of the adjustment arm. The multiple positions at which the adjustment arm can be engaged correspond to a range of desirable packer wheel pressures, including a position that results in excess of 100 lbs of packer wheel pressure. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a compactly designed packer wheel pressure adjustment assembly. The invention also advantageously provides a biasing spring capable of providing packing pressures in excess of 100 lbs.

    "abstract": "We have now developed a process for spraying hydroxyapatite or a modified hydroxyapatite onto a carbon fiber composite, such as a prosthesis, without degrading the composite. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the coating of hydroxyapatite or a modified hydroxyapatite onto a carbon fiber composite which comprises carbon fibers bonded together with a polymeric material, which process comprises positioning the carbon fiber composite in a chamber maintained at a reduced pressure of from 25,000 to 10,000 Pa (250 to 100 mBar), and plasma spraying non-agglomerated hydroxyapatite or a non-agglomerated modified hydroxyapatite onto a surface of the carbon fiber composite whilst cooling the said surface of the composite with an inert liquid coolant medium. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS By the term &#34;non-agglomerated&#34; as used herein is meant that the particles of the hydroxyapatite or modified hydroxyapatite are essentially individual particles and do not form clumps or clusters. In carrying out the process of the present invention the carbon fiber composite will generally be rotated and the speed of rotation will have an effect upon the cooling of the composite by the coolant medium. Preferably the composite is rotated at from 200 to 240 revolutions per minute, more preferably at from 210 to 220 revolutions per minute. If the composite is of a non-uniform shape and is not symmetrical about the axis of rotation then it may be necessary for the composite to rotate at a variable speed in order to ensure uniformity of thickness of the hydroxyapatite or modified hydroxyapatite coating. Alternatively, for some composite configurations it may be possible to move the plasma spraying torches, rather than to rotate the composite. The plasma spraying is carried out in a chamber maintained at a reduced pressure of from 250 to 100 mBar, preferably 175 to 125 mBar, more preferably at about 150 mBar. The plasma spraying is carried out using plasma spray torches which are generally operated using helium, neon, argon or nitrogen as the primary gas which is ionized to form the plasma, more preferably argon. The primary plasma forming gas may be admixed with a secondary plasma forming gas, such as a mixture of argon and hydrogen, for example Hytec 17 (Air Products &amp; Chemicals Corporation). The carbon fiber composite which is coated according to the process of the present invention comprises carbon fibers bonded together with a polymeric material such as polybutyleneterephthalate. In carrying out the process of the present invention the liquid coolant medium is preferably liquid carbon dioxide, although other inert liquid coolant medium may also be used. The liquid coolant medium is preferably spraying onto the rotating composite prosthesis from one or more nozzles positioned within the chamber such that the jets issuing from the nozzles impinge on the rotating composite prosthesis at an angle of from 150 to 300 to the horizontal, more preferably at an angle of about 22° to 26° to the horizontal. The nozzles are preferably placed at a distance of from 76 to 125 mm from the rotating composite, more preferably at a distance of about 100 mm from the composite. The non-agglomerated hydroxyapatite or non-agglomerated modified hydroxyapatite which is coated onto the carbon fiber composite in accordance with the process of the present invention is in the form of a free flowing powder, preferably having a particle size of below 150 micrometers, more preferably in the range of from 110 to 130 micrometers. The amount of coolant which is sprayed onto the composite will depend upon factors such as the speed of rotation of the composite, the melting point of the plastics material which bonds the carbon fibers together and the distance of the spray nozzles from the composite. Typically a temperature of about 200° C. or below at the surface of the composite will be maintained when the plastics material bonding the carbon fibers together is polybutylene terephthalate. The amount of coolant will thus be adjusted as required to maintain the desired temperature The coating of the non-agglomerated hydroxyapatite or non-agglomerated modified hydroxyapatite deposited according to the process of the present invention is preferably from 50 to 100 micrometers in thickness, more preferably from 50 to 90 micrometers in thickness. The present invention includes within the scope a carbon fiber composite which has been coated with non-agglomerated hydroxyapatite or a non-agglomerated modified hydroxyapatite by the above described process. The process of the present invention is of particular utility for the coating of prostheses. Whilst any prosthesis based on carbon fibers may be coated using the process of the present invention, the preferred composite is a cup or stem for a hip prosthesis or a knee prosthesis. The inside articulating surface of the cup is preferably coated with an ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene prior to the coating of the composite with non-agglomerated hydroxyapatite or modified hydroxyapatite. The outer coated surface of the composite prosthesis is inserted in use in the desired location in the patient and a boney ingrowth into the hydroxyapatite coating ensues because of the biocompatible characteristics of the coating. In this manner the implant becomes fixed in position and the joint which has been replaced regains its strength. An advantage of hydroxyapatite coated carbon fiber composite prostheses as compared to hydroxyapatite coated metal based prostheses is that the carbon fiber composite does not require any pretreatment to key or roughen the surface prior to coating since the first molten hydroxyapatite particles contained in the plasma stream which contact the carbon fiber composite melt the surface of the composite locally and thereby become bonded into the composite. This is in contrast to metal based prostheses which require a surface roughening treatment prior to coating such as a grit blasting treatment. The complete removal of residual particles of grit following a grit blasting operation is difficult. It will be appreciated, however, that any residual grit particles left on the metal surface prior to coating can cause problems such as inflammation of the joint when it is implanted into a patient and thus a coating technique which does not require such a pretreatment is advantageous. Although the process of the present invention is of particular importance for the coating of prostheses, it may also be used to coat other articles such as carbon fiber composite plates with non-agglomerated hydroxyapatite or modified hydroxyapatite. The present invention will be further described with reference to the following Examples.",

    "abstract": "For applying multi-component substances in mixed form, discharge devices are known which comprise a supply container with at least two chambers for respectively one of the pasty components of the mixture. Assigned to each chamber is an outlet stub for discharging the pasty substance upon application of pressure. To allow discharge of the pasty substances in mixed form, the outlet stubs of the known devices have a mixer unit mounted thereon, comprising a mixer housing including a substantially tubular portion and a coupling end for attachment to a supply container. In the tubular portion of the mixer housing, a mixer element is arranged by which the components, which have been supplied via separate channels, are subjected to a turbulence and mixing effect. Said channels are formed in the coupling end of the mixer housing and extend from the inlet stub of the coupling end to the mixer element. A device of this type is known e.g. from EP-A-0 730 913. Depending on the composition of the pasty components, their mixing will result in the respectively desired chemical reactions. For instance, if one of the two pasty components is a dental impression substance, the adding of a second component initiates and accelerates the polymerisation of this impression substance. Should this second component (also referred to as a catalyst) penetrate, via the mixer unit, from the one chamber into the other chamber of the supply container or should already the outlet stub of the chamber for the dental impression substance by contaminated with the catalyst, the whole device will be rendered useless, which, depending on the extent to which the chambers are filled, will cause a considerable loss of expensive material. Therefore, the two component flows have to remain separated from each other for the longest possible stretch of their moving paths and be brought together only within the tubular portion of the mixer housing. In the known discharge device for pasty two-component mixtures, the mixer housing is detachably locked to the supply container by means of a holding shell. The holding shell is supported for rotation on the mixer housing and is provided with radially outward locking projections formed in the manner of bayonet locks, which can be rotated to move under corresponding grip-over projections of the supply container. The invention further relates to a device for opening a tube bag containing a pasty substance. Said device is further provided to guide the pasty substance out of the tube bag. The pasty substances are offered in rigid containers or cartridges with displaceable bottom walls which are advanced by plunger elements arranged to be advanced by hand or by means of an engine in order to exert pressure on the pasty substances, thus discharging the substances from the cartridges and the cartridges or containers. In recent years, for reducing the packing material, the pasty substances have been increasingly offered in tube bags. For discharging the pasty substances, the tube bags have to be opened, preferably on their end sides. This is preferably performed by means of stationary piercing mandrels or the like cutting elements arranged on the end wall of a holding cap surrounding the end side of the tube bag and comprising a discharge stub. From EP-A-0 787 655, it is known to provide the inner projection of the holding cap with a piercing tube resiliently biased in the direction of the end face of the end of the tube bag. The as of yet known systems for automatic opening of tube bags are in need of improvement in so far as, for opening the tube bag, it is always required to exert pressure onto the tube bag and thus also on the pasty substance in the tube bag. Thus, the process of opening the tube bag is accompanied by the discharge of the pasty substance. As already mentioned above, discharge devices are used intermittently, the period between two successive uses being possibly so long that the mixture in the mixer unit will harden. As a result, the mixer unit has to be removed and replaced by a new one before the discharge of a mixed substance can be continued. Thus, the mixer unit is a disposable component, making it desirable to keep the number of components of this disposable mixer unit as low as possible. It is an object of the invention to provide a device for the discharge of a pasty two-component mixture, comprising a mixer unit with a reduced number of parts. According to the invention, to achieve the above object, there is proposed a device for the discharge of a pasty two-component mixture comprising: a supply container with two chambers for respectively one pasty component of the mixture, the supply container being provided with a respective outlet stub for each chamber, a mixer unit comprising a tubular mixer housing with a mixer element arranged therein, the mixer housing comprising a coupling end to be coupled to the supply container and having a two inlet stubs and two channels for the pasty components of the mixture leading to the mixer element, and comprising, on its opposite end, an outlet opening for the mixture, the inlet stubs being adapted for insertion into the outlet stubs or vice versa, and a holding shell for the coupling end of the mixer housing arranged for rotation on the supply container, the holding shell surrounding the two outlet stubs and comprising a recess of a shape at least in parts substantially identical with the cross sectional shape of the coupling end of the mixer housing, the holding shell being rotatable between a receiving rotational position in which the recess is oriented corresponding to the orientation of the coupling end of the mixer housing in the state where the inlet stubs are connected to the outlet stubs of the supply container, and a locking rotational position in which at least a part of the recess edge of the holding shell is in engagement over parts of the coupling end of the mixer housing. In the inventive discharge device, the holding shell holding the mixer unit is arranged not on the mixer housing but on the supply container. On this supply container, the holding shell is supported for rotation about its longitudinal axis. The holding shell surrounds the two outlet stubs of the supply container and is provided, on its front end facing away from the supply container, with a recess which in the first rotational position of the holding shell (receiving rotational position) allows the mixer housing to be mounted onto the outlet stubs of the supply container, while, in a second rotational position (locking rotational position) the edge of the holding shell delimiting the recess has been moved over partial regions of the coupling end, e.g. over radially projecting flange portions of the coupling end of the mixer housing, thus locking the mixer housing to the supply container. Therefore, the holding shell is not a component of the mixer unit anymore and thus will be preserved for the whole period during which the discharge device is used for application of the two-component mixture. In an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the coupling end is provided with two diametrically opposite and radially extending projections, while the holding shell is formed with a recess of a shape identical with the cross sectional shape of the coupling end at the level of the projections of the latter. Particularly, the coupling end of the mixer housing is of a substantially oval shape in the region of the radial projections. The recess of the holding shell, when in its receiving rotational position, is arranged relative to the outlet stubs of the supply container in the same manner as the inlet stubs of the mixer housing relative to the outer projections. Thus, the coupling end of the mixer housing can be moved through the recess of the holding shell until the inlet stubs of the mixer housing have been received by the outlet stubs of the supply container, or vice versa. In this position, the recess edge of the holding shell is arranged above the outer projections on the coupling end of the mixer housing so that, by rotating the holding shell into the locking rotational position, regions of the recess edge engage the outer projection from above. Suitably, the holding shell is in both of these rotational positions secured against unintended further rotation or reverse rotation, which is preferably accomplished by a corresponding locking effect. For the handling of the holding shell, it is further suitable to allow rotation of the holding shell only between its receiving rotational position and its locking rotational position. In this regard, it would be convenient to realize the limitation of the rotational movement by corresponding stopper elements on the holding shell and the supply container. For this purpose, the invention proposes a device for opening a tube bag containing a pasty substance, which device does not necessarily have to be realized in combination with the above described mixer holding device although such a combination is preferable, and which comprises a receiving cap for receiving an end side of the tube bag, which end side comprises an end face, the receiving cap comprising an end wall forming an abutment plane for the end face of the tube bag, and an edge extending from the end wall, an opening formed in the end wall and surrounded by a stub projecting from the end wall, and a piercing tube guided in the stub for axial displacement. In this device, it is provided according to the invention that the piercing tube is manually displaceable from a retracted position in which the piercing tube does not extend beyond the abutment plane into an advanced position in which in the piercing tube extends beyond the abutment plane.",

    "abstract": "The present invention is related to a golf bag, and more particularly to a golf bag that can be stably stood obliquely and has a simplified cord linking design. 2. Description of the Related Art In consideration of firmly laying golf bags in all terrain of golf courses and easily accessing clubs inside the golf bags, obliquely laying golf bags on the ground with the support of a bipod can be an ideal way. With reference to  FIG. 9 , a conventional golf bag with an integral bipod stand has a bag body  91 , two legs  92 , a pivot bracket  93 , two activating rods  94  and multiple guide brackets  95 . The bag body  91  has an open top, a bottom and a sidewall. The legs  92  are attached pivotally on the sidewall of the bag body  91  close to the top, and each leg  92  has a proximal end. The pivot bracket  93  is mounted pivotally on the bottom of the bag body  91 , has a flat bottom and contacts the ground when the golf bag  91  stands on the ground. The activating rods  94  are connected pivotally to the pivot bracket  93 , and each activating rod  94  has a distal end. The distal ends of the activating rods  94  are pivotally attached respectively to the legs  92  near the proximal ends of the legs  92 . The guides  95  are mounted on the sidewall, and each guide  95  has two through holes through which the activating rods  94  respectively extend. Inclining the bag body  91  relative to the pivot bracket  93  causes the activating rods  92  to pivot the legs  92  away from the bag body  91  so that the golf bag can stand obliquely and stably on the ground. However, the activating rods  94  are exposed and are easily damaged or broken in the course of normal uses, and dust, dirt corrosion or other debris easily accumulates in the through holes in the guides  95  and restricts the movement of the activating rods  94  through the guides  95 . Besides, the exposed activating rods  94  are not aesthetically appealing and the golf bag obliquely standing on the ground with an edge of the bottom facing the legs  92  and a part of the pivot bracket  93  is not stably enough. According to U.S. Pat. No. 7,494,009,, entitled to “Golf Bag Frame With A Leg Assembly”, the golf bag can fulfill the purpose of obliquely standing on the ground with a base and two legs pulled to extend out by a cord extending from the distal end of two activating lever and a foot of the base. The drawback of the &#39;009, Patent is that such a golf bag requires more effort in designing the top frame to allow the cord to penetrate through a passage defined through the top frame. With reference to  FIG. 10 , another conventional golf bag has a bag body  7 , a pivoting base  8  and a rear post  6 . The bag body  7  has a bottom and a front portion. The rear post  6  is mounted on the bottom of the bag body  7  to support the weight of bag body  7 . The pivoting base  8  is mounted on the bottom of the bag body  7  and has a bottom  81 , a sidewall  82 , two pivot balls  83  and a mounting bracket  84 . The rear post  6  is mounted on the rear of the bottom  81  of the pivoting base  8  to support the weight of the bag body  7  and the weight of all clubs in the bag body  7 . The sidewall  82  is formed on and protrudes upward from the bottom  81 . The pivot balls  83  are mounted on the sidewall  82 . The mounting bracket  84  is mounted on the sidewall  82  at a position away from the pivot balls  83 . The pivot bracket  84  is mounted pivotally on the sidewall  82 . With the pivoting base  8 , the golf bag can obliquely stand on the ground more firmly than the golf bag with an integral bipod stand as shown in  FIG. 9 . However, the issue that the exposed activating rods are easily damaged or not aesthetically appealing still exists. Furthermore, due to the tilting angle of the golf bag, the weight of the golf bag and all clubs therein leaning forwards crumples and shortens the front portion of the bag body  7 . Accordingly, a front post mounted on the front of the pivoting base  8  is inappropriate. Hence, the major support of the overall weight of the golf bag relies on the rear post, but this causes the rear post thick and heavy and the golf bag not stable upon standing. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The objective of the present invention is to provide a golf bag that can be stood obliquely in stable and has a simplified cord linking design. To achieve the foregoing objective, the golf bag has a bag body, a bottom frame, a top frame, two legs, multiple posts and a cord. The bag body is barrel-like and has a top opening and a bottom opening. The bottom frame is mounted on the bottom opening of the bag body and has a cover and a bottom cuff. The cover has a top, a top opening, a cover bottom, a cover sidewall, a chamber and a stopper. The top opening is formed through the top of the cover. The cover bottom is opposite to the top opening and has a front portion. The cover sidewall is formed on and protrudes upwardly from a perimeter of the cover bottom. The chamber is defined by the cover sidewall and communicates with the top opening of the cover. The stopper is formed on and protrudes upwardly from the front portion of the cover bottom. The bottom cuff is received in chamber of the cover and has a front portion, a cuff bottom, a cuff sidewall, two pivot elbows, a lever holder, a lever and multiple bottom post holders. The cuff bottom has a bevel surface formed on the front portion of the cuff bottom. The cuff sidewall is formed on and protrudes upwardly from a perimeter of the cuff bottom. The two pivot elbows are oppositely and pivotally mounted on an inside of the cover sidewall and a periphery of the cuff sidewall, and abut the front portion of the cover bottom. The lever holder is hollow, formed on an inside of the cuff sidewall to align with the stopper, and has a through hole formed through a top of the lever holder. The lever is received and pivotally mounted in the lever holder. The bottom post holders are tubular and mounted on the cuff bottom. The top frame is mounted on the top opening of the bag body and has a top sidewall, a divider, multiple top post holders, a cord guide and two leg holders. The top sidewall has an inner surface. The divider is attached to the inner surface of the top sidewall to divide a space inside the top sidewall into multiple sub spaces. The top post holders are formed on the inner surface of the top sidewall to correspond to the bottom post holders. The cord guide is mounted on the top sidewall and the bag body and has a branching channel formed on the cord guide. The two leg holders are pivotally mounted on a periphery of the top sidewall, penetrate through the top sidewall to abut against the cord guide. The two legs are respectively connected to the leg holders. Each of the posts has two ends respectively mounted in one of the top post holders and a corresponding one of the bottom post holders.",

The Relevant Technology Severe back pain can be caused by a number of different ailments, including spinal stenosis, degenerative disc disease, spondylolisthesis, and the like. Many such ailments can be corrected by controlling or limiting relative motion between the affected vertebrae. Accordingly, a variety of devices including artificial discs and fusion devices have been proposed. Such devices are limited in that they typically provide only one mode of correction. Many such devices cannot be replaced or corrected. This is particularly true with intervertebral implants, in which bone-growth is often stimulated to integrate the implants with the surrounding bone tissue. Thus, if the device fails to solve the problem, there may be no other recourse for the patient. Further, many known devices are expensive or difficult to manufacture, or are difficult to implant. Some known intervertebral devices require the adjacent vertebrae to be distracted excessively, thereby endangering the surrounding ligaments and other connective tissues. Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a device that remedies these problems. Such a device would considerably enhance outcomes for patients with spinal disorders.",

    "abstract": "This invention pertains generally to the field of implantable body tissue stimulators, e.g., cardiac single chamber and dual chamber pacemakers and cardioverters, and more specifically to a method and apparatus for monitoring associated implanted lead and electrode impedance characteristics for analysis and modification of lead selection, operating mode and output pulse parameters. 2. Description of the Prior Art Implantable body tissue stimulators usually include an electrode in contact with tissue to be stimulated mounted on a lead or housing containing an electrical conductor to be connected between the electrode and a source of stimulating energy. Usually the stimulating energy source is a fully implanted pulse generator which provides a capacitive discharge output pulse or shock to the electrode through the lead. Such pulse generators and stimulators include cardiac pacemakers, nerve and muscle stimulators and cardioverters, including combined pacemaker-cardioverter-defibrillator devices. Moreover, such devices usually include sense amplifiers coupled to the leads and electrodes specifically designed to sense spontaneous electrical activity of skeletal muscle and heart tissue. The integrity of the lead and electrode as measured by its impedance can critically affect both stimulation and sensing performance. The technology of cardiac pacemakers implantable nerve stimulators and pacemakers-cardioverters-defibrillators has developed a high level of sophistication of system performance. The current generation of cardiac pacemakers and pacemaker-cardioverter-defibrillators incorporates microprocessors and related circuitry to sense and stimulate heart activity under a variety cf physiological conditions. These devices may be programmed to control the heart in correcting or compensating for various heart abnormalities which may be encountered in individual patients. A background description of modern cardiac pacemaker technology is set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4,958,632, which patent is incorporated herein by reference. It is a primary goal of programmable, multiple-mode, demand-type, cardiac pacemakers to accomodate the changing requirements of a diseased or malfunctioning heart. For example, single chamber, fixed rate pacers have been used extensively in the past to correct bradycardia, or slow heart rates Demand pacing is employed to avoid competing rhythms in patients who have some cardiac activity. Dual chamber pacing is used to treat complete or intermittent heart block by maintaining atrio-ventricular (AV) synchrony. Various other parameters (such as rate, pulse amplitude or width, sensitivity, refractory, etc.) may also need to be altered from time to time to custom-fit the pacemaker to each patient. Programmability has also been incorporated into pacemakers to select the type of electrodes implanted, either unipolar or bipolar. A unipolar lead is one in which stimulation occurs between the cathode tip electrode and the pacemaker case, or anode. A bipolar lead is one in which stimulation occurs between the cathode tip electrode and an anode, ring electrode spaced approximately one inch from the tip electrode. Physicians select one lead type over the other for a variety of reasons. A unipolar lead may be chosen due to its advantage of being physically smaller and more flexible and, therefore, easier to implant. Unipolar leads also have the advantage of being less vector sensitive for intrinsic complexes (particularly premature ventricular and atrial contractions) due to the larger dipole. On the other hand, bipolar leads provide superior noise immunity to myopotentials and electromagnetic interference. It is also known that bipolar leads eliminate pectoral muscle stimulation, however, there has also been an occasional report of diaphragmatic stimulation. Since these leads are inaccessible after implantation (except by surgical procedure), bipolar leads may advantageously be used in either unipolar or bipolar configurations through noninvasive reprogramming of the implanted pulse generator. While electronic circuitry can be, and is, incorporated within the pacemaker itself for exercising or testing various circuit components (such as the status of battery power sources, and the effectiveness of various amplifiers, waveform shaping stages and the like), it is often more difficult to test the integrity of the leads and implanted electrodes to which the pacemaker is coupled in order to verify that such leads and electrodes can function to allow for the desired pacing operation. At the implantation of electrode systems, minor damage is sometimes incurred which may affect the lead s electrical insulation. This type of damage may go undetected and be without present effect on the implanted system, but the condition may manifest itself after extended time in service. When a breakdown or significant degradation of the pacemaker lead insulation occurs, it can result in a loss of sensing of intrinsic cardiac events or a loss of capture due to a lessened amount of energy reaching the cardiac tissue. Based on the underlying rhythm of the patient, this may have serious or even disastrous results. The reduced output energy reaching the heart is due to partial energy being shunted to other areas through the insulation opening. Other types of damage can also occur to a pacemaker lead at implantation or later. A fracture in a conductor coil can affect operation by reducing the energy output to the cardiac tissue by causing a substantial increase in the lead resistance to current flow. A partial fracture will cause a reduction in output energy, while a complete fracture will result in no energy reaching the heart due to an infinite resistance (open circuit) Another type of detectable error relates to the failure of the electrode tip to be in proper contact with the heart wall. It has been routine to measure lead impedance or stimulation threshold at the time of implantation to permit optimizing the location of the pacing lead and to maximize longevity of the pacer. These acute measurements are made with an oscilloscope or, more frequently, with a special instrument called a pacing system analyzer or PSA. Later, after the lead has &#34;healed&#34; into the heart tissue, the margin of capture and delivered energy are estimated by the physician. With the advent of output pulse programmable pacers, physicians have been able to adapt the pacer&#39;s output to the threshold requirements of the patient and thus prolong the longevity of the implanted device. To assist the physician with followup care, modern pacers use internal circuitry to monitor the output pulse parameters and to telemeter this information to the physician via a programmer. This information is used in assesing the performance of the pacemaker and the associated lead. A problem which is presented by this technology is a discrepancy between the measured values of lead current and delivered energy presented by the programmer, PSA and oscilloscope. These differences result primarily from different measurement methodologies. Typically, prior art pacers place a series resistor in the output path of the lead current, as disclosed, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,140,131. During the delivery of a pacing stimulus, the voltage drop across the resistor is measured and telemetered out. This technique requires the use of a high precision resistor to reduce measurement errors. It also introduces a component whose failure can lead to an undesirable &#34;no output&#34; condition. Also, such a system is wasteful of output energy because of the inclusion of the measuring resistor. Particular methods and apparatus for scanning the implanted leads of a pacemaker system to determine lead impedance and to detect abnormalities which may signal degradation and impending failure of pacemaker leads are the subject of the above-referenced &#39;632 patent and U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,949,720; 4,899,750, and 5,003,975, all incorporated herein by reference. Briefly, the &#39;750 patent discloses systems for measuring the output voltage drop delivered to the pacing lead during pacing and determining the lead impedance from that measurement. The thus-determined lead impedance is compared with a moving average of the measured parameter and any deviation from that average by more than a predetermined amount is considered an anomaly. Three such anomalies in succession result in an event being counted in a first event counter for future consideration by a doctor during a patient checkup or the like. The system also monitors sensed heart signals and counts as a notable event any deviations in slope of the heart signal by more than a predetermined amount. These latter events are counted in a second counter to provide information for future reference. Thus, the &#39;750 patent system determines the integrity of the implanted leads and electrodes by making measurements during both the pacing and sensing time intervals of the pacemaker timing cycle. The &#39;632 patent discloses measuring lead impedance as a function of the time that it takes to recharge the discharged output capacitor to full voltage, and automatically switching pacing electrodes or modes of operation if the time is excessively long (excessively high impedance) or excessively short (exclusively low impedance) or upon loss of capture. The &#39;975 patent discloses similar responses to excessive or insufficient lead impedances, using the technique of the &#39;750 patent. The &#39;720 patent discloses a lead impedance measuring circuit including a large number (typically 200) of FET transistors operated in parallel to discharge a capacitor through the heart tissue. Pacer lead current is monitored by measuring the current through a small number (typically 2) of these transistors. The current monitoring function is performed by a current-to-voltage converter coupled to an analog-to-digital converter which may make one or more voltage measurements during the output pulse. The ability to time the measurement with respect to the leading and trailing eges of the output pulse provides flexibility to match the telemetered pacing current data with operating room measurements thus reducing the confusion that discrepancies can cause. Additionally, the voltage developed by the current-to-voltage converter may be applied through additional circuitry to the gates of the FETS to provide for a constant current output pulse. The aforementioned &#39;750, &#39;975 and &#39;720 patents employed a technique for the calculation of lead and lead electrode-tissue interface impedance through measurement of the initial and final voltages across a coupling capacitor when the lead system is paced with a fixed pulse width pacing pulse. The voltage measurement is then translated into a current based on the capacitance value on the pulse width. The lead impedance is then calculated as the average voltage divided by the average current, from which known switch impedances are subtracted. The methods illustrated by these patents have several error items which contribute to overall inaccuracy of as much as ±20% in the 100-1000 ohm load range. These error terms include the impedance approximation equation (which avoids the natural log function in order to save on software), capacitance tolerance, analog to digital conversion accuracy, sampled voltage gain stage accuracy, sample and hold leakdown, voltage reference drift and pulse width tolerances of the programmed pacing pulse and the pulse generator circuit timeout thereof. In commonly assigned co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 619,494 filed Nov. 29, 1990, in the names of Wayne et al it is proposed to calculate lead impedance from lead current computed by measuring output capacitor discharge time over a continued output capacitor discharge occurring from the trailing edge of the pacing pulse until a threshold (which is automatically set to reflect the voltage drop occurring during the preceding output pulse) is reached.",

    "abstract": "In the invention described, the difficulty of holding the clip applier perfectly steadily under the microscope while applying a clip is overcome by use of a flexible cable or hydraulically tubing attached to the handle, enabling the requisite force to be applied remotely and indirectly. The invention applies to any surgical clip device in which clips are applied from the end of a stem by movement of an internal member within the handle, so as to cause movement of a clip applying component in the stem of the device, which deploys, crimps and applies a clip. In the case of the VCS clip applier described, this movement of the internal movable member is caused by squeezing the wings of the handle inwardly, but other motions could be involved. The remote actuation provided by the invention also solves the problem of narrow access which would restrict deployment of the VCS instrument. Thus, in a preferred embodiment of the invention a device for applying non-penetrating clips to very small blood vessels or other small tissue separation sites includes a hand-held clip applier and a flexible cable release or hydraulic actuator or other flexible remotely-actuated device for delivering a compressive pushing force to the internal movable member of the clip applier without applying force directly to the hand-held clip applier, thus isolating any vibration or unsteady movement from the clip applier tip. The clip applier in a preferred embodiment is capable of applying and securing clips to blood vessels 2 mm and under, and this clip applier may be of well-known construction such as the product Auto Suture VCS, with an important modification. The tool has a handle suitable for gripping in the hand, a clip storing and dispensing stem extending from the front end of the handle, and a tip at the end of the stem including means for dispensing and serially applying metal clips in non-penetrating engaging configuration against sections of tissue on either side of a wound or separation, to clamp the two sections together for hemostasis and regrowth. The dispensing means is activated on the receipt of an axial force to a clip-applying component of the stem. Within the handle is a movable member which, when caused to move by a force applied from outside the handle, is effective to cause movement of the clip-applying component in the stem such as to cause dispensing and application of a clip. Further, there is a linkage of appropriate form within the handle, engaged with the movable member in the handle and extending to a position so as to be capable of receiving a pushing force from the exterior of the handle. The movable member and the linkage means can be one piece if desired. The flexible actuator, if in the form of a flexible cable release device has, a cable sheath and an internal cable capable of delivering a pushing force through the sheath, typical of a flexible cable release for a camera. A thumb button at a remote hand-grippable end of the cable release applies a pushing force to slide the cable through the sheath in order to cause extension of a pusher tail piece at a proximal end of the cable sheath when the thumb button is pushed. The proximal end of the cable sheath is secured to the clip applier tool&#39;s handle such that the pusher tail piece will apply force to the linkage means in the handle upon application of thumb pressure, thus advancing the linkage means and the movable member in the handle, and thus advancing the clip-applying component to dispense and apply a clip. This pushing force could also be supplied by a flexible hydraulic actuator, such as a syringe and tubing and sterile fluid, all standard equipment in operating rooms. It is thus among the objects of the invention to make far more effective and reliable the use of a surgical clip applier for closing tissue separation sites, by modifying the clip applier to receive its actuating force through a flexible, remotely operated device, supplied by an assistant or via a foot-pedal, thus isolating the instrument from hand movement and allowing for use in narrow, difficult positions. Replacing the squeeze wings at the tip end of the tool handle with a remote release permits the tool to be used endoscopically or in deep inaccessible areas, by holding the tool near the base end rather than the tip of the handle, as one might handle a small paint brush or a long screwdriver. These and other objects, advantages and features of the invention will be apparent from the following description of a preferred embodiment, considered along with the accompanying drawings.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to neutralizing antibodies targeting high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), and compositions and methods comprising such antibodies useful in treating, inhibiting or preventing HMGB1-associated neuropathy. The invention also relates to the combination of the variable regions of heavy and light chain immunoglobulins derived from a single human antibody-producing cell and amino acid molecules encoding such antibodies and antigen-binding portions, methods of making human anti-HMGB1 antibodies and antigen-binding portions, compositions comprising these antibodies and antigen-binding portions and methods of using the antibodies, antigen-binding portions, and compositions. 2. Description of Related Art In normal physiological conditions, HMGB1 is confined to the nucleus as a non-histone DNA binding protein that is involved in regulation of chromatin dynamics (Hock et al., 2007), such as stabilizing nucleosome formation (Goodwin et al., 1973), facilitating gene transcription (Kleinschmidt et al., 1983) and modulating steroid hormone receptors (Boonyaratanakornkit et al., 1998). In contrast, in the case of tissue injury, HMGB1 migrates toward the cytoplasm and then is released extracellularly, acting as a danger signal (Bianchi and Manfredi, 2007). In addition to being passively released by necrotic cells, HMGB1 can also be actively secreted by specific cells, e.g., macrophages and myeloid cells, of the innate immune system activated by pro-inflammatory signals such as lipopolysaccharide, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1 β(IL1-β) (Bonaldi et al., 2003). It has been also demonstrated as a cytokine that mediates endotoxin lethality (Wang et al., 1999), propagating inflammation (Wang et al., 2001), prolonging macrophage activation (Andersson et al., 2000) and chemoattracting mesoangioblast (Palumbo et al., 2004). It is becoming increasingly clear that both passively released and actively secreted extracellular HMGB1 convey the same danger signal to attract and activate inflammatory cells (Abraham et al., 2000; Andersson et al., 2000), to enhance the expression of cell adhesion molecules in endothelial cells (Fiuza et al., 2003) and to impair the barrier function of endothelium (Yang et al., 2006). Specifically, serum levels of HMGB1 have been directly associated with mortality in patients with lethal sepsis and in experimental models of endotoxaemia (Wang et al., 1999; Fink, 2007), suggesting that HMGB1 is a crucial late mediator of the sustained activation of pro-inflammatory cascades associated with fatal outcomes. Specific receptors interacting with extracellular HMGB1 include receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), toll-like receptor (TLR)-2 and TLR-4 (Hori et al., 1995; Park et al., 2004). The binding of HMGB1 to its receptors results in the activation of several kinases such as extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK)-1/2, p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase, which ultimately leads to the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent genes (Huttunen et al., 1999; Fiuza et al., 2003). As human HMGB1 has cytokine activities and mediates prolonged systematic inflammation as well as immune responses, we have thus investigated and successfully established the link between an aberrant production of HMGB1 in plasma of patients with neuromyelitis, i.e., neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and conventional multiple sclerosis (MS) (Wang et al., 2012). NMO and MS are a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), most frequently starting with a series of bouts, each followed by complete remission and then a secondary, progressive phase during which the neurological deficit increases steadily. However, the clinical course of NMO is usually more severe than classical or conventional MS (Cornelio et al., 2009). Within five years of onset, fifty percent of NMO patients either loss of functional vision in at least one eye or becoming unable to walk unassisted, or the annual costs for hospitalization exceed several hundred million. There remains an urgent need for prophylactic, pre-emptive and treatment strategies for management of HMGB1-associated neuromyelitis. Anti-huHMGB1 therapies by using of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to specifically bind to and neutralize this particular target protein are expected to be effective in nature. Accordingly, targets with highly selective late mediator are preferred to broaden the therapeutic window (Wang et al., 1999). Furthermore, given the remarkable divergent emergence of the physiological from pathological conditions of huHMGB1, mAbs raised against it are expected to selectively target extracellular HMGB1. Based on these considerations, a monoclonal antibody against huHMGB1 that may inhibit receptor interaction and therefore block kinase activation and the downstream pro-inflammatory response, e.g., TNF-α secretion is highly desirable. Although mAbs are long-established as essential research tools, their therapeutic promise has taken considerably longer to realize, requiring further advances, such as the humanization of mouse antibodies and/or transgenic protocols, to reduce their immunogenicity inherent in murine proteins. The biopharmaceutical industry has thus seen a full shift of new antibody therapeutics from chimeric to humanized to fully-human sequences. The ultimate objective in the industry is to manufacture a mAb drug that is identical to that which is produced in the human body. In theory, heavy and light chain components derived entirely from the human origin could be used to assemble mAbs. Indeed, the use of phage antibody technology to construct human heavy and light chain libraries as described in e.g., WO92/01047, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,652,138 and 5,885,793A, offers the ability to isolate such human antibodies directly. Moreover, U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,652,138 and 6,075,181 demonstrate the feasibility to construct in vivo transgenes to introduce into a non-human animal substantially the entire human immunoglobulin loci and subsequently perform animal immunization to obtain heavy-and-light-chain pairs comprised human sequences. However, the resultant pairings may not be naturally-occurring and still remain to be immunogenic as indicated in the official FDA labeling information (http://www.accessdata.fda.gov)—the frequencies of patient to generate anti-drug antibodies can be as high as 26% and 3.8% for Humira (adalimumab) and Vectibix (panitumumab), respectively. Therefore, this may not be the best available strategy. In fact, while there are general rules (De Groot and Scott, 2007), predicting the precise immunogenicity of a specific protein in the genetically heterogeneous human population is a difficult if not a fundamentally impossible task. This is highlighted again by the case of Enbrel (etanercept), which is a biopharmaceutical produced by recombinant fusion between the TNF receptor and the constant region of the IgG1 antibody to act as a TNF inhibitor. Since both fusion partners are bona fide naturally-occurring ubiquitous proteins in humans and, in principle, should not be immunogenic. Yet clinical data specify that 5.6% treated patients tested positive for anti-etanercept antibodies (Dore et al., 2007). Our understanding in all of the area of immunogenicity is increasing, but currently it seems impossible to close the circle. Alternatively, a sharp clinical contrast provided by the therapeutic immunoglobulin preparations, and especially intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), may well turn out to be optimistic in resolving the problem of immunogenicity. The IVIg refers to a therapeutic biological product containing human IgG that is prepared by large-scale industrial fractionation of human plasma derive from samples collected from thousands of blood donors (Kazatchkine and Kaveri, 2001; Seite et al., 2008), and thus represents in essence a preparation of human polyclonal antibodies. It usually administrated 400 milligrams to 1 gram per kilogram body weight weekly, by which it generally acts as a replacement therapy for many years (Farrugia and Poulis, 2001; Wittstock et al., 2003). Despite the worldwide consumption of IVIg may well above 100 tonnes per year, adverse reactions to IVIg occur in less than five percent of patients (http://consensus.nih.gov/1990/1990IntravenousImmunoglobulin080html.htm), also patients seem to tolerate to IVIg and very few if there is any anti-IVIg responses reported (Lemieux et al., 2005; Imbach, 2012b; Imbach, 2012a). Lack of immunity to IVIg suggests that ingenious designs to harness naturally-occurring configurations inherent in a single antibody-producing B cell could provide a substitute for such approach. Nevertheless, while foreign antigens, which are molecules derived from a potentially harmful invader, trigger the production of antibodies by the immune system; self antigens such as HMGB1 are usually tolerated by the immune system. In reality, although self antigen-reactive B cells may be present in the body, self antigens are not likely to initiate an immune response and thus without leading to the production of specific antibodies. To effectively transform such challenging circumstances, “site-directed in vitro immunization” (Chin et al., 2007)(U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,494,779, 8,021,860 and 8,158,386) was developed by the inventors to initiate in vitro self antigen-specific immune responses from primary human lymphoid cells. Self antigens can then be neutralized by the resultant mAbs similar to foreign ones. One of the major problems in obtaining highly potent human therapeutic mAbs is how to isolate antigen-specific clones derived from the site-directed in vitro immunization scheme or even the circulating memory B cell compartment of a human donor. This so-called rare population are clones that under-representative and, accordingly, very little in number. Some of these rare specific cells are expected to be most interesting in modern medicine and thus much research has attempted to address this question, including the use of the antigen-conjugated chitosan as taught by WO 2010104828. However, in light of the limitations of pH-dependent solubility and the reactivity of its amine groups in enzymatic conjugation inherited in biopolymer chitosan to account for many aspects of protein conjugation, it will clearly be important to develop a method for the separation of immune cells by interactions of proteins of said B cells with antigens. Rabbit antisera have been generated against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the amino terminal part of HMGB1 (amino acid residues 2-15), coupled to radially branching lysine dendrites and against the entire HMGB1 (U.S. Pat. No. 6,468,533). Murine mAbs produced from a hybridoma resulting from the fusion of mouse myeloma with B cells obtained from a mouse immunized with a part of huHMGB1 (amino acid residues 89-1162) or purified recombinant rat HMGB1 (U.S. Pat. No. 7,288,250). Rat mAbs specific to the carboxyl terminal (amino acid residues 200-211) were reported using HMGB1/HMGB2 as an immunogen (Liu et al., 2007). R&amp;D Systems, Inc. makes and sells a polyclonal anti-human HMGB1 antibody (Cat. # AF 1690) produced in chicken immunized with purified, NS0-derived recombinant human HMGB1. To date, no complete human mAbs with naturally-occurring configurations inherent in a single antibody-producing B cell to HMGB1 neither have the use of such kind of mAbs for inhibiting or treating HMGB1-associated neuromyelitis been reported. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide neutralizing antibodies targeting high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), specifically, the neutralizing antibodies not only containing exclusively human sequences but also comprising naturally-occurring configuration of heavy-and-light-chain combination. Another object of the present invention is to provide an isolated complete human neutralizing anti-HMGB1 mAbs or antigen-binding portions thereof that bind to HMGB1, preferably the neutralizing epitopes of HMGB1, more preferably the HMG A box and RAGE binding segment of HMGB1. In a preferred embodiment, the neutralizing antibodies are complete human monoclonal antibodies or antigen-binding portions thereof. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for producing complete human neutralizing anti-HMGB1 mAbs or antigen-binding portions thereof that binds to at least one part of HMGB1, and the resultant mAbs produced by the method target specific domain of HMGB1 protein with less allergic potential. Another object of the present invention is to provide a method for inhibiting or treating HMGB1-associated neuromyelitis, comprising administering an effective amount of complete human neutralizing anti-HMGB1 mAbs to a subject in need thereof, the complete human neutralizing anti-HMGB1 mAbs effectively inhibit and/or treat HMGB1-associated neuromyelitis with less allergic responses. To achieve the objects, the present invention provides an artificial neutralizing antibodies targeting high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). The artificial neutralizing antibodies is preferably an complete human neutralizing anti-HMGB1 mAbs and produced by the following steps of: (a) providing a synthetic antigen comprising at least one peptide having amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:3 and SEQ ID NO:4 to immunize a group of human CD56 −  lymphocytes; (b) the lymphocytes immunized by the synthetic antigen are enriched by antigen-coupled magnetic beads; (c) adding Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to the human CD56 −  lymphocytes immunized by the synthetic antigen; and (d) selecting the EBV-infected cells that produce the antibodies that recognize HMGB1. The present invention provides a method for producing an complete human neutralizing anti-HMGB1 mAbs or antigen-binding portions thereof that binds to at least one part of HMGB1, comprising the following steps of: (a) providing a synthetic antigen comprising at least one peptide having amino acid sequence represented by SEQ ID NO:3 and SEQ ID NO:4 to immunize a group of human CD56 −  lymphocytes; (b) the lymphocytes immunized by the synthetic antigen are enriched by antigen-coupled magnetic beads; (c) adding Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to the human CD56 −  Iymphocytes immunized by the synthetic antigen; and (d) selecting the EBV-infected cells that produce the antibodies that recognize HMGB1.",

    "abstract": "Disclosed herein are topical compositions and methods for stimulating the growth of hair and treating disorders resulting in hair loss wherein said compositions include a cyclopentane heptanoic acid, 2-cycloalkyl or arylalkyl compound represented by the formula I: wherein the dashed bonds represent the presence or absence of a double bond which can be in the cis or trans configuration and A, B, Z, X, R 1  and R 2  are as defined in the specification and a penetration enhancer. Such compositions are used in stimulating hair growth of human or non-human animals. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Dermatologists recognize many different types of hair loss, the most common being “alopecia” or “baldness” wherein humans (mostly males) begin losing scalp hair at the temples and on the crown of their head. However, hair loss may be due to many other disorders. Hair loss is often accompanied by a change in the hair growth cycle. All mammalian hair passes through a life cycle that includes the anagen phase, the catagen phase and the telogen phase. The anagen phase is the period of active hair growth. In the scalp, this phase lasts from 3-5 years. The catagen phase is a short 1-2 week transitional phase between the anagen phase and the telogen phase. The final telogen phase is considered a “resting phase” where all growth ceases. This phase is also relatively short-lived lasting about 3-4 months before the hair is shed and a new one begins to grow. With the onset of baldness, a successively greater proportion of hairs are in the telogen phase with correspondingly fewer in the active growth anagen phase. Additionally, different types of hair exist including terminal hairs, vellus hairs and modified terminal hairs. Terminal hairs are coarse, pigmented, long hairs in which the bulb of the hair follicle is seated deep in the dermis. Vellus hairs, on the other hand, are fine, thin, non-pigmented short hairs in which the hair bulb is located superficially in the dermis. Modified terminal hairs are seen in eye lashes and eye brows. As alopecia progresses, a transition takes place wherein the hairs themselves change from the terminal to the vellus type. Accordingly, alopecia (baldness) also includes a deficiency in terminal hairs. One non-drug treatment for alopecia is hair transplantation. Plugs of skin containing hair are transplanted from areas of the scalp where hair is growing to bald areas. This approach can be reasonably successful, however it is costly, time-consuming and painful. Other non-drug related approaches to treating alopecia include ultra-violet radiation, massage, psychiatric treatment and exercise therapy. None of these approaches, however, have been generally accepted as effective. Even such things as revascularization surgery or acupuncture have shown little, if any, effect.

    "abstract": "The present invention is directed to a therapy method and apparatus for treatment of a patient with focused acoustic waves of the type having a source of focused acoustic waves, means for receiving echoes of the acoustic waves reflected from a subject to be treated, and means for switching the apparatus from a locating to a therapy mode. 2. Description of the Prior Art Non-invasive acoustic therapy systems are utilized, for example, for the disintegration of calculi (lithotripsy), for treating tumor pathologies (hyperthermia) or for treating bone conditions (osteorestoration). The received, reflected parts of the acoustic waves are employed for locating the region to be treated. For example, the chronological relation between the generation of the acoustic waves and the reception of their reflected parts is utilized to judge whether the region to be treated is located in the focus of the acoustic waves. When the chronological allocation indicates a position of the region to be treated outside the focus, the source of acoustic waves and the subject to be treated are displaced relative to one another such that a chronological allocation is achieved that indicates the region to be treated is in the focus of the acoustic waves. German OS 27 22 252 discloses such a therapy system for use with the disintegration of calculi on the basis of shockwaves. In this therapy system, reduced-energy shockwaves are generated during locating mode. Damage to the tissue surrounding the calculus to be disintegrated during the locating procedure is prevented in this way. The parts of the shockwaves reflected from the subject to be treated are received with a plurality of broadband pressure sensors. The output signals of the pressure sensors, however, do not allow the region to be treated, i.e. the calculus, to be exactly positioned in the focus of the acoustic waves under all circumstances. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a therapy system of the type initially described wherein a more exact positioning of the region to be treated in the focus of the acoustic waves is possible. This object is achieved in accordance with the principles of the present invention in a therapy apparatus for treatment with focused acoustic waves having a shockwave unit as a source of focused acoustic waves, means for receiving parts of the acoustic waves reflected from a subject to be acoustically irradiated, means for switching the apparatus from a therapy mode to a locating mode, and means for varying the oscillatory frequency of the generated acoustic waves dependent on whether the apparatus is switched to the therapy or to the locating mode. In the therapy apparatus of the invention, thus, it is possible to match the oscillatory frequency of the generated acoustic waves originally to the requirements of the therapy mode and optimally to the requirements of the locating mode. This represents a considerable advantage over known systems because first, the size of the focus region of the acoustic waves, and second, the attenuation that the acoustic waves experience in the subject to be treated, are dependent on the frequency of the acoustic waves. For reducing the treatment duration and for subjecting a patient to an optimally low dose of acoustic energy, it is advantageous in for the therapy mode for the size of the focus region to approach that of the region to be treated as closely as possible, and for the attenuation of the acoustic waves to be optimally low in the subject being treated. During the locating mode, a higher attenuation of the acoustic waves does not inherently represent a problem, as long as it is assured that their reflected parts reach the means for reception with adequate amplitude. The focus zone during the locating mode should, however, be optimally small, since the topical resolution increases as the size of the focus zone decreases. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the oscillatory frequency of the acoustic waves is higher in the locating mode than in the therapy mode. The therapy mode is especially effective as a consequence of the larger focus zone and of the low attenuation of the acoustic waves in the subject to be treated. In the case of the locating mode, wherein the attenuation of the acoustic waves in the subject to be treated is of secondary significance, a small focus zone is achieved resulting in a high precision of the locating procedure. In another embodiment of the invention the source has a single, electrical generator allocated to it with which it can be driven to generate acoustic waves, the generator--when the therapy apparatus is switched to the locating mode--driving the source for generating acoustic waves at an oscillatory frequency which is different from the oscillatory frequency during the therapy mode. Only one generator is thus required, making the system more economical. In certain instances, however, it may be desired that not only the oscillatory frequency but also other acoustic characteristics of the acoustic waves, for example, their amplitude, should deviate greatly in the locating mode from their values in the therapy mode. In a further embodiment of the invention for such instances, the source has two electrical generators allocated to it, one driving the source during the therapy mode and the other driving the source during the locating mode, the generator for the therapy mode and the generator for the locating mode driving the source for generating acoustic waves with respectively different frequencies and, if desired different amplitudes. If the means for reception contain a piezoelectrically activated element, this element can be activated for the emission of acoustic locating waves whose frequency is higher than the acoustic waves generated by the source during therapy mode, in addition to the normal function of the means for reception of receiving parts of the locating waves reflected from the subject. This makes it possible to employ locating waves whose frequency and other acoustic characteristics can be selected entirely independently of the conditions of the therapy wave source. In another preferred version of the invention, the source of acoustic waves is an electromagnetic pressure pulse source that can be charged with a pulse-like current by a capacitor discharge for generating a pressure pulse, with the effective capacitance differing for the therapy mode and for the locating mode.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to urinary apparatus generally and particularly to apparatus for the measurement of urethral angle change and vesical pressure. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Female urinary stress incontinence is a pathology affecting more than ten percent of the female population over age 60. The pathology results from either one or both of the following anatomical conditions: 1) abdominal straining causing urethral hypermobility; 2) urethral intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD), which is the inability of urethral musculature to completely close the urethra or keep it closed during stress. The surgical procedures to correct these pathologies are dependent on whether urethral hypermobility or ISD is the predominant pathology. In the case of urethral hypermobility, incontinence is corrected by prevention of urethral descent during stress and/or abdominal straining. In the case of ISD, correction is accomplished by increasing the passive pressure applied on the urethra so as to increase its passive resistance to urine passage. Failure to determine the correct type of incontinence results in the performance of an inappropriate surgical procedure with subsequent unsatisfactory surgical success and subsequent complications. To properly establish the type of urinary incontinence, two factors must be determined: 1) urethral descent during straining, which may be determined by measurement of the spatial angular change of the urethral axis (herein called the urethral angle change) during straining and 2) leak point pressure, the minimal vesical pressure at which urine leaks through the urethra. Low leak point pressure characterizes ISD. A common method in the art to evaluate urethral angle change is by installing a &#34;rod&#34; into the urethra with the physician estimating the rod axis angle change by visual examination. Leak point pressure is generally established during urodynamic evaluation by the placement of a pressure measuring catheter in the bladder with the physician recording the pressure at which urine leakage through the meatus is visually detected. Both these testing methods lack objectivity and accuracy in obtaining results. There is therefore a need for an invention which provides a more objective and accurate measurement of urethral angle change and leak point pressure concomitantly. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a probe and sensors for the measurement of urethral angle change and/or vesical pressure during abdominal straining. In preferred embodiments of the present invention, a probe for insertion into the urethra of a subject, for use in diagnosis of urinary stress incontinence, comprises one or more angle sensors, a pressure sensor and a leakage detector. In one embodiment of the invention, the angle sensor comprises a magnet which floats on the surface of liquid inside a ball-shaped cartridge to which sensors for measuring magnetic fields, or Hall effect devices, are attached. Each Hall effect device outputs a value related to its orientation with the magnet. These values are preferably transmitted by the Hall effect device to a CPU which calculates the angle changes of the probe from a predetermined reference. The CPU may then display the angle changes and any other pertinent information on a display screen of a monitor. In another embodiment, the angle sensor comprises a conductive fluid, such as liquid mercury, in a chamber with a resistive element. The portion of the resistive element which is covered by fluid varies with the angle of the probe. The electrical resistance of the resistive element varies with the amount of the portion submerged in fluid. The measured resistance is transmitted to the CPU which converts the resistance into an angular value. The CPU processes different resistive values to determine the change in urethral angle. In still other embodiments of the present invention, the angle sensor comprises a chip accelerometer, for example, Single Chip Accelerometer model ADXL05, produced by Analog Devices Inc. of Norwood, Mass. The use of such accelerometers in measuring tilt angle is known in the art. The pressure sensor is preferably located at the proximal end of the probe, but it may alternatively be located at or adjacent to the distal end. The leakage detector is preferably a type of electrical conductivity sensor, which senses the presence of a leak of urine when the urine creates electrical contact between two conductive strips or rings on an outer surface of the probe. In some preferred embodiments of the present invention, signals from the angle sensor, pressure sensor and leak detector are processed by an analog device and transmitted to a multiplexer. A central processing unit (CPU) samples data from the multiplexer preferably via an analog-to-digital converter. The CPU may alternatively sample data received from the sensors and leakage detector, process the data and display pertinent information on a monitor. In one of these preferred embodiments, an additional pressure sensor is inserted into the subject&#39;s rectum. The rectal pressure sensor is processed, multiplexed and sampled by the CPU, as described above, which then displays rectal pressure data along with data from the other sensors. There is therefore provided, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, apparatus for diagnosing urinary stress incontinence of a subject, including: a substantially rigid, disposable probe insertable into the urethra of the subject, generally along a longitudinal axis of the urethra; and a reusable sensor unit, removably coupled to the probe, for sensing physiological parameters of the subject. Preferably, the apparatus includes a fluid pressure sensor in pressure communication with a distal end of the probe. Preferably, the pressure sensor is contained in the sensor unit, and the probe includes a flexible diaphragm in fluid communication with the distal end, which diaphragm provides the pressure communication between the pressure sensor and the distal end while substantially preventing fluid communication between the distal end and the pressure sensor.

    "abstract": "This invention generally relates to application of closures to containers and, more particularly, to apparatus for restraining a container against rotation during the application of a closure to the container. It is particularly useful for restraining rotation during pre-tightening and final tightening of screw-on closures. 2. Description of the Prior Art. Innovation in the bottling industry is very dependent on the ready availability of machinery for processing new types of containers and closures. For years, the crown was the dominant closure employed. A different type of closure was then developed, which comprised a cap shell of aluminum which was inserted over the threaded neck end of the container and then secured in place by rolling threads in situ into the walls of the cap shell. Such closures are commonly called roll-on caps. The roll on cap necessarily required a completely new applicating machine because not only was an axial force necessary to hold the closure in place on the bottle neck and effect a seal between the closure liner and the end of the bottle neck but, concurrently, a rotating movement had to be imparted to the thread forming rollers. There was no practical way that a conventional crown-type applicating machine could be modified to apply the new style roll-on closures and, as a result, the adoption of the new closure proceeded very slowly. It did proceed, however, and now machinery for applying roll-on closures is common. In recent years, there have been significant developments in plastic technology making the utilization of a threaded plastic closure completely feasible for use in the carbonated beverage field. For example, a threaded closure of the type shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,987,921 and 4,016,996 has been shown to be commercially practicable, and an economically desirable change for the bottler to adopt if applicating machinery was available to assemble the plastic closure to the bottle neck. Since the plastic closure required a concurrent application of an axial force to the top panel of the closure with a rotation of the closure relative to the bottle neck, it was desirable to utilize existing closure applicating machines for effecting the assembly of aluminum shells to bottle necks to apply the new style plastic closure, and thus minimize the new investment required by the bottler. This was accomplished by a number of modifications of capping heads which may be applied to existing roll-on closure applicating machines. Some of the roll-on type applicating machines do not incorporate a sufficient rotational movement of the capping head as it approaches its lowermost position relative to the bottle to effect the complete threading of a closure onto the threaded bottle neck. Therefore, pre-tightening mechanisms were developed, which partially apply a threaded closure on the threaded neck of a bottle prior to a closure being engaged by the applicating head. In addition, problems were encountered in keeping the container from rotating during the final closure tightening process when sufficient torque is applied to seal the closure on the neck, yet allowing the closure to be manually removed by the ultimate consumer. Restraint systems to control container rotation have been added on to application machinery to press against containers from the outside during the final tightening of the closure. However, these systems have not been satisfactory since the containers are already turning when they reach the system and it has to apply braking torque. It takes on undesirable amount of friction and pressure to stop a container from rotating after it is already turning, which may damage container labels or the containers themselves and/or interfere with the application of the correct amount of torque to seal the closure on the neck. Similar problems are met when the turntable surfaces are covered with friction material to stop container rotation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The method and apparatus for restraining containers against rotation when being moved through operation stations of a cap application process, in accordance with the teachings of this invention, includes a rotatable star wheel having a plurality of outwardly opening pockets formed therein for receiving and moving containers from a container receiving station to a container discharge station. Stationary guide rails are disposed along the periphery of the star wheel to retain the containers in the pockets. Normally, movement of containers by the star wheel past the guide rails causes container rotation in the pockets, which interferes with the most efficient functioning of pre-tightening and final tightening of threaded closures on the threaded necks of containers. To prevent such rotation in the pockets, means are mounted on the star wheel adjacent each of the pockets for frictionally engaging containers in the pocket with a force in excess of the frictional force applied to the containers by the guide rails. In the embodiment shown, a resilient belt is supported on the star wheel so that a sector of the belt is disposed across each of the pockets. Thus, when a container is received in the pocket the belt is urged away from the guide rails and wraps around the contour of the container. In a preferred embodiment the belt is formed from urethane and the guide rail container contact surfaces are formed from a smooth plastic to insure an adequate difference in coefficients of friction to prevent rotation of the container. The belt thus comprises a resilient means adapted to be biased away from a normal at-rest position within the confines of each pocket in response to reception of a container in the pocket. The biasing or urging of the resilient means increases the frictional force exerted by the resilient means. In the cap application machinery disclosed herein, the container restraint system is used on both an in-feed and a capping star wheel to prevent rotation of containers during the placing of the closure on the neck, pre-tightening of the closure into and final tightening of the closure into a sealing position on the neck. The object of this invention, therefore, is to provide an improved method and apparatus for restraining containers against rotation during a cap application process. Other objects, advantages and features of this invention will become more apparent during the course of the following description when read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates generally to medical instrumentation and more particularly to opto-electronic devices that non-invasively measure and determine the velocity and magnitude of blood flow within tissues as well as the thickness and dynamics (other than and/or unrelated to blood flow) of specific components of the tissue when it is comprised of distinct layers. Moreover, it also pertains to measurement instruments that possess the ability to determine the precise location of boundary regions between distinct layers of tissue, as well as triangulate onto the region(s) where initial fluid movement occurs. 2. Description of the Prior Art Laser-Doppler methodology, as applied to the measurement of blood flow, was initially described by in an article entitled &#34;In Vivo Evaluation of Microcirculation by Coherent Light Scattering&#34;, written by Stern, which appeared in Nature, Vol. 254, pages 56-58 in 1975. The basic principles of this methodology are that the frequency of the laser light back scattered or reflected by a laser illuminated tissue is Doppler broadened, due mostly in part to the motions of red blood cells. The extent to which the initial laser frequency is broadened as well as the light intensity within specific parts of the broadened frequency spectrum, both provide information regarding the relative motions and concentration of red blood cells within the tissue. Utilizing these established methodologies which correlate laser-Doppler signals to red blood cell concentrations and motions within tissues, several commercially-available blood flow monitors that rely on laser/laser-diode and fiber optic technologies have been developed. The essential elements of these systems incorporating the laser-Doppler methodology are: a) a laser beam delivered directly onto a part of the tissue, usually by means of an optical &#34;outlet&#34; fiber where the laser light is unfocused and divergent; b) an optical element that receives a portion of any back scattered or reflected laser light from the illuminated tissue, also typically by means of an optical &#34;pick-up&#34; fiber placed in the vicinity of the outlet fiber (≧100 μm optical fiber center-center distance); c) an appropriate means for converting photon flux to electrical signals, and d) an algorithm that realistically represents the movement and approximate numbers of red blood cells within the tissue, as a function of time. A characteristic common to these first-generation blood flow monitoring systems is that they all use outlet and pick-up optical fibers that directly contact the tissue when delivering and accepting laser light normal to a surface of the skin being measured. More recently, second generation blood flow monitors have incorporated new adaptations in the optics of the laser light delivery system and back scattered laser light detection technologies, which now allow for the measurement of blood flow over an area of a body part. In particular, U.S. Pat. No. 4,862,894 issued to Fuji on Sep. 5, 1989; U.S. Pat. No. 5,291,885 issued to Taniji, et al. on Mar. 8, 1994; U.S. Pat. No. 5,291,886 issued to Katayama, et al. on Mar. 8, 1994; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,339,817 issued to Nilsson on Aug. 23, 1994, all describe systems which permit the measurement of blood flow within a body part. The optical modification taught by these systems is comprised of a laser light source that can be focused, to a point or a line source, and positioned at specific locations within an area of body by means of scanning optical mirrors. The total back scattered or reflected laser light Doppler or speckle signal from each independent location within an area of body is also collected by the same optical mirrors and partially reflected to a photodetecting system. The obtained electrical signals, in time, are then processed in a manner similar to the first generation blood flow monitors so as to represent the movement and approximate numbers of red blood cells at each specific location within an area of the body. Upon completion of one scanning location, the laser beam is repositioned to a new location, where the Doppler signal collection and analyses, in time, is once again performed. This process is repeated for the entire area of the body that is of interest. Concurrent with obtaining blood flow characteristics at each location within an area of body, a visible image of the area is also recorded by means of video imaging. Both the visible image and blood flow characteristics at each location are later superimposed to yield the approximate characteristics of blood flow for the area of the body. An additional feature of the new optical arrangement is that it is no longer in direct contact with the tissue. To its detriment, however, is that the delivery and acceptance of laser light is still essentially normal to the skin surface. Regardless of which type of prior art optical arrangement one employs however, systems employing these prior art arrangements are inadequate in locating precisely the region within the skin where blood flow originates. In particular, of four main criteria established to determine the utility of systems to measure blood flow within the skin: 1) non-traumatic and non-invasive, 2) accurately follow blood flow, 3) sensitive to small changes, and 4) insensitive to blood flow from other parts of the tissue or tissues, all blood flow monitors described above fail to meet two of the most significant criteria. Specifically, they are insensitive to small changes and insensitive to blood flow from other parts of the tissue or tissues. Moreover, these laser Doppler systems also fail to yield other characteristics of the skin apart from blood flow. Consequently, a continuing need exists in the art for methods and apparatus which provide non-invasive blood flow and tissue information. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a method and apparatus for non-invasive in vivo measurement of blood flow characteristics at precise locations or regions within tissues that is also sensitive to small changes in blood perfusion. In addition to monitoring blood flow, the invention is also capable of determining other physical characteristics of the tissue, such as: the thickness of the tissue above the region(s) where blood flow was first observed to occur, and where applicable, the elasticity of that tissue. The invention is a non-contact, in vivo method that is based on the detailed observations of the scattered photons emitted at the surface of tissue as a highly collimated narrow laser beam or a focused laser light spot or line that is positioned on the surface of the tissue at a specific angle or variable angles. An optical receiving system focused on the measurement plane of the tissue collects and collimates light back scattered from not only the initial position of laser incidence, but also the light emitted at the surface of the tissue as the initially inserted laser beam propagates beneath the surface of the tissue and into deeper regions. A portion of the back scattered light is reflected into a video system to obtain a visible image. By means of a translating optical fiber probe or a fiber probe array, a photodetecting system partitions the remainder of the back scattered laser light collected by the optical receiving system. Each partition represents contiguous locations on the surface of the tissue from which the surface emitted back scattered laser light, along the propagating vector or trajectory of the initially inserted laser beam beneath the surface of the tissue, is collected. Thereby, each partition evidences the unique static and dynamic properties of light back scattered from different regions of the tissue through which the initially inserted laser light is traversing at different depths. The results of these measurements are subsequently output into readily usable and easily understandable forms. In a particular use of the invention, specifically, where the invention is applied to measure the blood flow and other physical properties of the skin, appropriate analyses of both the static and dynamic properties of back scattered light from all contiguous optical fiber probe sampling positions enables the determination of the thickness of the stratum corneum and the epidermal region, the elasticity of the stratum corneum, the blood flow precisely at the epidermal/dermal boundary region, the general texture or shape of the boundary region, and the blood flow characteristics of tissue beneath the boundary region. The thickness of the layers of the skin is obtained by the method of triangulation which makes use of geometry, the refractive index of the tissue medium and the optical fiber position on the surface of the tissue from which the back scattered light is partitioned and monitored. The optical fiber position essentially signifies the depth of the region(s) from whence the initially inserted laser light is scattered back towards the surface of the tissue. The selection of the position used to calculate the depth of a specific region within the tissue will be determined either by the static or by both the static and dynamic properties of the scattered light observations from contiguous locations on the surface of the tissue. For such cases when the refractive index of the tissue medium is unknown, observations of the back scattered laser light emanating from the surface of the tissue need be performed for several laser light incidence angles prior to the exact determination of the depth of a specified region. In addition to thickness determinations, the invention makes use of correlation functions to analyze the dynamic properties of the back scattered laser light collected by optical fibers positioned in the vicinity of the initial laser light insertion point, in order to ascertain the elastic properties of the stratum corneum. By the method of triangulation, the invention also determines the precise depth or location of the epidermal/dermal boundary region at which capillary blood flow occurs. That is, at a location or an optical fiber position far removed from the initial laser light insertion position, a maximum in the magnitude of the frequency shifted Doppler signal is observed when the optical fiber position and the initially inserted laser light propagating beneath the tissue triangulate onto the epidermal/dermal boundary region where capillary blood flow is known to occur. Appropriate signal processing method(s) can further determine capillary blood perfusion in the region by detailing not only the amplitude of the Doppler signal, but also the velocity of the red blood cell motion. Thus the invention is capable of real time scattered light signal collection and analyses for determining capillary blood perfusion, as well as the heart rate and quite possibly the respiration rate within tissues. Because of structural irregularities that exist within the epidermal/dermal boundary region, the determination of both the amplitude of the Doppler signal and the velocity of red blood cell motions is also necessary to triangulate onto the precise location of the boundary region when one or more apparent maximums in the magnitude of the frequency shifted Doppler signal are present. The number of maximums observed is dependent not only on the irregularity of the boundary region, but also the laser light incidence angle. By varying the laser light incidence angle and repeating the above measurements, as well as by performing the same series of measurements over an area of the skin and then mapping all information relating the depth and location of blood flow, the invention is thus also capable of generating an accurate 2-dimensional representation of the irregular structure of the epidermal/dermal boundary in terms of blood perfusion characteristics. The combined results of these measurements may also be displayed into readily usable and easily understandable forms.",

Discussion of the Background In a conventional method for teaching the basic gestures for sports, performances or behaviors, the trainer typically makes an exemplary performance and then has the trainee conduct his or her performance, and points out their differences orally or physically to the trainee. Various kinds of media are getting popular where the trainer&#39;s performances or gestures are recorded with guidance orally or on paper. U.S. Pat. No. 5,184,295 issuing Feb. 2, 1993 and herein incorporated by reference, discloses a method including having an exemplary performances or gestures recorded in a video image and overlying the video image over trainee&#39;s ones by electronic computation to produce a three-dimensional image for helping teaching performances. The disclosed method involving prerecorded images of exemplary performances did not permit specially effective teaching for trainees of particular ages or body strengths, nor stepwise teaching for the individual trainees with various steps of achievements. The present inventor, Mr. Katayama, also helped make an invention where a trainee&#39;s performance is taken as a video image and then is regenerated on a CRT screen in a still picture on which the optimal range of movement of the body or its members and the basic lines or references for the optimal form can be shown, as previously filed and disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,333,061 incorporated herein by reference. In the teaching situation where the trainer makes an exemplary action or performance under the presence of the trainee who then tries to make a performance as guided, a method for showing or U.S. Pat. No. 5,33,061 incorporated herein by reference. In the trainer&#39;s and trainee&#39;s performances are pictured in 6 to 8 frames in a time sequence with a camera with a plurality of lenses and instantly processable film such as POLAROID (registered trademark) film for making comparative analysis. Although this method permits a picture of the performances to be immediately made because of the characteristics of the photosensitive material, it turned out to be difficult to make the pictures of two persons&#39;s actions on separate films in synchronism with each other. The method has mostly not been used for making a comparative analysis between the trainer&#39;s and trainee&#39;s forms or gestures. No teaching method has been known which permits a comparison of the person&#39;s actions and gestures on the spot, thus enabling effectively explaining and questioning thereon.

The system includes a holder that holds and pierces the cartridge to provide a cartridge inlet and a cartridge outlet that together establish a flow path through the beverage extract to provide the brewed beverage. A storage tank comprising a supply of liquid and having a reduced diameter cup-shaped bottom is in fluid communication with the cartridge via a chamber outlet port. A portion of the storage tank is controllably sealed to form a metering chamber in cooperation with the reduced diameter cup-shaped bottom. A first pump provides compressed air along a flow line to the metering chamber to force liquid from the metering chamber and through the chamber outlet port. A sensor senses pressure in the flow line and provides a sensed pressure signal indicative thereof. A controller commands the first pump on, monitors the sensed pressure signal and turns the first pump off after detecting that the sensed pressure signal value has dropped below a threshold value indicating the predetermined volume of liquid has been delivered through the chamber outlet port. The system may also include a second air pump that delivers a second flow of compressed air downstream of the metering chamber outlet port and upstream of the cartridge inlet in response to a brew interrupt signal received by the controller to drive the liquid downstream of the metering chamber outlet port to the cartridge.

Nos. 5,244,919 and 5,072,011. Although the oral dosage form of JM216 being pursued in the clinic has obvious advantages over injectable platinum complexes such as cisplatin and carboplatin, it is reported by M. J.

In a phase I clinical study C max  and AUC increased less than proportionally to dose at dose levels ≧200 mg/m 2 . This was associated with greater interpatient pharmacokinetic variation and reduced urinary platinum recovery. Such pharmacokinetic variation and reduced gastro-intestinal drug absorption may be due to the poor water-solubility of JM216 which the present inventors have determined to be 0.3 mg/ml at 23° C. In addition to the bioavailability problems, there are important reasons why it is often preferred to administer a drug like JM216 rectally rather than orally, e.g. nausea, vomitting and stomach irritation associated with oral dosing, inability to swallow and the possibility of partly avoiding the hapatic first pass clearance. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a method of improving the aqueous solubility and thus absorption and bioavailability of JM216 pharmaceutical formulations, which comprises employing in said formulations amorphous JM216. The amorphous JM216 is obtained by grinding or milling JM216 powder with β-cyclodextrin or certain polymers for a sufficient period of time to convert the JM216 to an amorphous state, the polymer being preferably selected from gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone (PVP) and hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC).

    "abstract": "The present invention concerns a surgical retracting device and its method of manufacture. It will be of use during surgical operations to retain or retract biological or synthetic tissue, in particular in mini-invasive operations. 2. Description of the Related Art During surgical operations, in particular laparoscopies, the surgeon&#39;s range of movements is limited. They use various instruments including thread with a pea to lift various organs from the zone to be operated on. This instrument consists of a thread placed on a needle and equipped with a pea at its other end. The pea is created manually by the surgeon before or during the operation using cotton or gauze. This type of small ball of gauze or cotton is pricked by the needle so as to be held on the thread. This thread equipped with a pea is used by passing the needle through the biological and/or synthetic tissue until the pea comes into contact with the tissue. The surgeon then pulls on the thread in order to retract the tissue. An instrument such as described above has the main disadvantage of having to be made manually by the surgeon. This is time wasting and does not guarantee the reliability of the finished assembly. Another disadvantage is that the surgeon could be pricked when preparing this assembly. Therefore, there is a need for a thread-with-pea type instrument that can manufactured industrially and reproducibly. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION To this end, the present invention concerns a surgical device comprising a linking element such as a thread and a support element with at least three holes in which the thread passes through so as to attach the button and the thread by a first knot on a first face of the support element and a second knot on the second face of the support element. For instance, a button may be used as the support element. This device according to the invention may be manufactured industrially based on a simple process. The surgical fixing device could then be marketed in a form that would enable its immediate use by the surgeon. The support element and the linking element are joined so as to ensure the strength of the linking element. Indeed, the support element and the knots on the first and the second face are connected so as not to weaken the linking element. According to a preferred embodiment, at least three through holes on the support element are aligned so as to limit the strain on the interlinking element and therefore the risk of it breaking. Other goals and advantages will appear in the following description of a preferred but not restrictive embodiment of the invention. First of all it has to be remembered that the invention concerns a surgical retracting device comprising an linking element and a support element characterised in that the linking element is a thread and that the support element comprises a first face, a second face and at least three through holes in which the thread passes through, the support element and the thread being connected by means of a first knot on the first face and a second knot on the second face. According to preferred but not restrictive variations of the invention, the device is such that: at least three through holes are aligned,   the support element is circular,   at least three holes are aligned on the diameter of the support element,   the support element has an elongated shape,   at least three holes are aligned on the diameter of the support element,   the support element has a central hole and two peripheral holes,   the central hole is positioned at the centre of the support element,   the two peripheral holes are equidistant from the central hole,   the arrangement of the first knot and the second knot ensures that the thread is held at the level of the first face and the second face respectively,   the first knot consists of a simple knot involving a length of the thread passing through the first peripheral hole and a length passing through the second peripheral hole, a length of thread passing around a free end of the thread on the side of the first face, a length of thread passing under the length of thread around the free end of the thread on the first face side,   the second knot consists of a length of the thread passing through the central hole towards the second face, a length of the thread passing around the length of the thread forming a bridge on the second face.",

    "abstract": "In order to avoid the drawbacks of known arrangements, the technical problem to which the present invention is directed consists in providing a machine where the shoe shanks are removed during the normal working cycle and without moving the support out of its position. As a solution of this problem, the present invention provides at least two holding elements mounted on the machine, and which grip the support alternately at supporting points spaced longitudinally from each other along the support, in such a manner that the support is always gripped by at least one holding element during travel of a shoe shank along the support. Due to the large forces acting on the support during the seam smoothing operation, in a preferred embodiment of the invention, the control of the holding elements is so designed that both holding elements grip the support simultaneously, in a form-locking manner, during the smoothing operation, and release the support alternately for brief intervals during the time between smoothing of the seams of successive shoe shanks. An advantageous gripping of the support, with simultaneous centering of the support, is obtained by designing the holding elements as holding tongs with swingout jaws, where each pair of jaws has two three-point contacts acting on the support and which jaws are arranged symmetrically to each other. Preferably, at least one latch is provided on each pair of jaws to secure the support against rotation or angular displacement about an axis extending longitudinally of the support, and another latch is provided to secure the support against movement in the longitudinal or axial direction. The latches can be wedge-shaped and can engage corresponding wedge-shaped grooves. In order to prevent positively the support from changing its position while it is held by the holding tongs, the drive for each of the holding tongs is so designed that the movement of one jaw of a pair into its closing position is completed before the other jaw has moved into its closing position. A particularly favorable solution of the problem of actuating the holding tongs is obtained if each jaw is operable by a toggle linkage with the drive for closing each jaw being connected to the pivot of the toggle linkage. Furthermore, a stop limits the movement of the toggle linkage of the jaw first reaching its closing position in the expanded condition of the associated toggle linkage. Due to this feature, it is possible to perform the movements, necessary for actuating the jaws, in a simple manner with little effort, and in which the given position of the support does not change while, at the same time, large holding forces are obtained, such as are necessary for retaining the support against movement during the stitched seam smoothing operation. An object of the invention is to provide an improved machine for smoothing stitched seams on shoe shanks and in which the shoe shanks are removed from a support during the normal working cycle without moving the support out of its position. Another object of the invention is to provide such a machine including two holding elements which grip the support alternately at supporting points spaced longitudinally along the support from each other. A further object of the invention is to provide such a machine in which both holding elements grip the support simultaneously during the smoothing and compressing operation, and release the support, in alternation with each other, briefly during the time between successive smoothing and compressing operations. For an understanding of the principles of the invention, reference is made to the following description of a typical embodiment thereof as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.",

Consequently, the support must be swingable to provide sufficient space between the two friction wheels to remove the shoe shanks. \n     Swinging out of the support after a certain sequence of operations on the machine requires, however, additional energy and represents also lost time in a production operation.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to an automatic soap dispenser, particularly to a liquid soap dispenser with an infrared sensor to sense and control the dispensing of liquid soap. (b) Description of the Prior Art A conventional soap dispenser consists of a housing which holds a package of liquid soap. The package of soap usually comes with a feeding tube, which is placed on a holding base. A user normally presses a cover or a handle to squeeze a small amount of liquid soap for cleaning. A more advanced type of automatic soap dispenser uses a solenoid valve to control a moving plate, and electromagnetic force is generated to push and squeeze the soap feeding tube to dispense the liquid soap. In addition, infrared sensing is also applied to sense the hands and a sector gear is driven to squeeze the soap feeding tube to dispense the liquid soap for use. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The main object according to the present invention is to provide an automatic soap dispenser in which an infrared sensing device, together with a driver device is used to drive an elongated toothed piece in a forward direction, allowing a pressed member provided in the forward section of the toothed piece to squeeze a soap feeding tube so that liquid soap can be dispensed for cleaning. By this design, the movement of the toothed piece is perpendicular to the soap feeding tube and, thus a fixed amount of liquid soap can be dispensed to give a precise and stable operation. Another object according to the present invention is to provide an automatic soap dispenser in which the infrared sensing device can be deactivated when the housing of the structure is opened. A post provided in the housing is used to deactivate a micro switch of the infrared sensing device, thus it is a convenient feature to open the housing to replace the liquid soap bag or the battery pack. A further object according to the present invention is to provide an automatic soap dispenser in which the battery pack is stored in an enclosed chamber and its orientation is perpendicular to the soap feeding tube, therefore, the liquid soap can be prevented from contacting the battery pack and decrease the life of the battery pack. Still another object according to the present invention is to provide an automatic soap dispenser in which the sensing and the driver devices are enclosed in a chamber which is isolated from the soap bag and the soap feeding tube. Thus the automatic soap dispenser can be prevented from being exposed to a corrosive environment and a trouble-free operation can be assured. The automatic soap dispenser according to the present invention differs from the prior art in that the pressed member will only be driven to squeeze once when the sensing device is triggered. On the other hand, the conventional soap dispenser continues to dispense the liquid soap once it is triggered. Thus the present invention can provide a savings of liquid soap usage.",

    "abstract": "We have found, surprisingly, that good yields of blue cheese flavouring substances can be obtained by means of submerged culture fermentation in the absence of milk products and wherein the fermentation step takes significantly less than 24 hours. Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a flavouring substance which comprises fermenting free fatty acids or salts thereof with agitation in a culture medium inoculated with Penicillium roqueforti under submerged aerobic conditions and pasteurising the liquid product obtained. Advantageously, the free fatty acids or salts thereof are produced by hydrolysing a fat or oil of animal or vegetable origin. During the fermentation, the free fatty acids or salts thereof are metabolised into methyl ketones which provide some of the predominant flavour volatiles of blue cheese. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The fatty acids or salts thereof utilized in the present invention are preferably of lower to mid chain length, for example, C 4  to C 14  and especially C 6  to C 12  fatty acids which may be liberated from fats and oils having C 4  to C 14  triglycerides. The aeration is conveniently achieved by passing air through the culture medium, for instance at a rate of from 200 to 1500 cc/min, preferably from 400 to 1200 cc/min and especially from 600 to 1000 cc/min. Although the quantity of the free fatty acids or salts thereof used in the culture medium may be up to, for instance, 10% by weight, the desired flavour may be obtained with much less, for example, from 0.5 to 5%, preferably from 0.75 to 4%, and especially from 1 to 3% by weight based on the total weight of the culture medium. The free fatty acids or salts thereof may be incorporated in the culture medium in the form of the mixture obtained by the hydrolysis of the oil or fat, comprising fatty acids or salts thereof, unhydrolysed oil and water. The culture medium also contains water, the total amount of which is conveniently from 50 to 95% and preferably from 70 to 80% by weight based on the total weight of the culture medium. The culture medium may also optionally contain sodium citrate in an amount of, for example, up to 4%, preferably from 0.5 to 1.0% by weight and dextrose in an amount of, for example, up to 6.0% and preferably from 0.5 to 1.0% by weight, based on the total weight of the culture medium. The fermentation may be carried out in either a sterilisable fermenter or a sanitized closed jacketed vessel. If a sanitized closed jacketed vessel is used, the water should be first sterilised, for instance, by boiling. The pH of the fermentation mixture may be, for instance, from 4.0 to 8.0, preferably from 5.0 to 7.0 and especially from 5.9 to 6.1. Although Penicillium roqueforti mycelia may be used in the fermentation, the spores are preferred because the mycelial stage has a tendency to metabolise the methyl ketones further whereas the spore stage does not and because the mycelia are more susceptible to fatty acid toxicity than the spores. The spores are preferably used at a level of from 1×10 6  to 8×10 8  spores/gram and more usually from 4 to 6×10 8  spores per gram. They may conveniently be used at a concentration of from 1 to 6 gm/100 ml and preferably from 3 to 5 gm/100 ml in the fermentation. The spores may, if desired, be cultured and then centrifuged to a pellet which can be used as the inoculum, or they may be used on bread crumbs. Although methyl ketones can be detected by gas chromatography after 3 hours, the fermentation may proceed for up to approximately 72 hours. However, it is preferred that the fermentation is allowed to proceed for a period of from 6 to 30 hours, while a duration from 8 to 24 hours usually provides the optimum flavour production. By the fermentation process a liquid product is obtained which is pasteurised by any conventional method to deactivate the Penicillium roqueforti, for example, by means of a high temperature-short time treatment. The liquid product may then be separated into the oil and water fractions and the oil fraction which contains most of the methyl ketones can be used as the flavouring agent itself. Alternatively, the liquid product, after pasteurisation, may be made into a paste by concentrating the flavour by conventional means such as reverse osmosis or volatile stripping and used as a flavour either by itself or in admixture with dairy solids. In another variation, the liquid product, after pasteurisation may be spray dried using carriers such as maltodextrins or milk solids, etc., and used as a flavour. The fat or oil from which the fatty acids are produced by hydrolysis may be of animal origin such as butterfat from milk or a vegetable derived fat, preferably coconut oil. Advantageously, the fat contains lower to mid-chain length fatty acids, especially C 6  to C 12  fatty acids which may be liberated from fats and oils having C 6  to C 12  triglycerides. The fat or oil can be hydrolyzed by any conventional means such as chemically using NaOH, enzymatically using lipases or by high temperature and pressure to produce the free fatty acids. The preferred enzyme is one that liberates C 4  -C 14  fatty acids from oils or fats. They may be derived from the following micro-organisms: Mucor sp., Aspergillus niger, Rhizopus oryzae, Candida cylindracea, Penicillum sp. or from animal origin such as pancreatic lipase from porcine pancreas. The preferred method of lipolysis is by using a lipase derived from Rhizopus oryzae. The amount of oil or fat used in enzyme hydrolysis may be from 5 to 25% by weight and preferably from 15 to 20% by weight based on the total weight while the amount of water may be from 75 to 95% by weight and preferably from 80 to 85% by weight. The amount of enzyme is conveniently from 0.025 to 0.25% and preferably from 0.05 to 0.15% by weight based on the total weight of the hydrolysis reaction medium. The hydrolysis time, temperature and pH depend on the particular enzyme employed but, typically, the time ranges from 0.5 to 2.0 hours, the temperatures ranges from 25° C. to 45° C. and the pH ranges from 4 to 8. When using a lipase derived from Rhizopus oryzae, the preferred temperature is from 35° to 40° C., the preferred time is from 45 to 75 minutes and the pH is preferably maintained at a value from 6.5 to 7.5 using a buffer such as sodium hydroxide or a phosphate, etc. The use of sodium hydroxide is preferred to produce the sodium salts of the fatty acids.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to the field of non-contact tonometry, and more particularly to a non-contact tonometer employing an improved applanation detection system which increases measurement reliability by making the instrument less sensitive to alignment variations. B. Description of the Prior Art In the operation of known non-contact tonometers for measuring intraocular pressure (IOP) of a patient&#39;s eye, an increasing force air pulse is discharged through a pump-fed nozzle along a test axis toward the eye to deform the cornea from a state of convexity, through an instantaneous state of &#34;applanation&#34; wherein a predetermined area of the cornea is flattened, to a state of concavity; the cornea is then allowed to return to its original convex state under natural forces. Opto-electronic means are used to continuously monitor the corneal deformation and thereby determine the moment of applanation. The interval of time or pump plenum pressure required to achieve applanation is then used as a correlate of IOP. Heretofore, applanation detection systems used in non-contact tonometers have been telecentric in nature, requiring precise three-dimensional alignment of the discharge nozzle relative to the cornea. For example, the XPERT® NCT manufactured by Reichert Ophthalmic Instruments, a division of Leica Inc., assignee of the present application, currently employs a telecentric applanation detection system as shown in FIGS. 1A and 1B. An emitter E directs an incident beam of light represented by parallel rays R1, R2, and R3 at an oblique angle toward corneal pole C. A single photo-detector D, which is positioned at a symmetrically equal and opposite angle behind a pinhole aperture A in the focal plane of a collector lens L, receives a small bundle of corneally reflected rays. When the cornea is in its normal convex state, as shown in FIG. 1A, the fan-shaped dispersion of rays R1-R3 results in a weak detection signal. As the cornea is progressively transfigured toward a state of applanation by the fluid pulse, the fan-shaped configuration of dispersed rays closes and the detector signal becomes stronger. When applanation occurs according to FIG. 1B, dispersion of rays R1-R3 is at a minimum, resulting in a peak signal at detector D. As may be appreciated, the telecentric system described above is extremely sensitive to misalignment of the instrument with respect to the cornea. FIG. 2 includes a plot of a typical detector signal as a function of time in a properly aligned instrument, and FIG. 3 includes a similar plot in a misaligned instrument. The undesirable consequence of misalignment is a false reading of an early signal peak, which will yield an inaccurate IOP measurement that is usually lower than actual IOP. Since an important reason for subjecting the patient to IOP measurement is to detect elevated IOP, an indication of glaucoma, falsely low IOP measurements due to misalignment are a serious and recognized problem. In view of this, a large portion of the cost of a commercially available non-contact tonometers is attributed to the expensive opto-electronic alignment system necessary for precise alignment. In the XPERT® NCT discussed above, the applanation detection system imposes stringent alignment requirements on the order of ΔX≦0.05 mm, ΔY≦0.05 mm, and ΔZ≦0.3 mm, where X is side-to-side, Y is vertical, and Z is distance from the patient. It is further noted that efforts to relax alignment precision requirements by providing a larger pinhole aperture at the detector are not helpful because signal resolution is lost, once again making it impossible to accurately determine the moment of applanation with certainty. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to improve a non-contact tonometer by providing an applanation detection system which gives greater measurement accuracy and precision despite variations in instrument alignment from an ideal alignment condition. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, applanation detection is carried out by an infra-red emitter in cooperation with a light-sensitive detector array. The emitter is positioned to direct an oblique beam of collimated light for reflection by the patient&#39;s cornea, and the detector array is located behind a beam contractor and an aperture-lens array at a symmetrically opposite angle to the emitter for receiving the corneally reflected rays. At the moment when applanation occurs due to an incident air pulse, dispersion of corneally reflected rays will be at a minimum and a peak signal will be generated by one of the detector array elements depending upon alignment conditions. The signal information from each detector array element is evaluated as a function of time to determine an optimal signal curve from the detector array element best located under the alignment conditions to receive the concentrated light energy. Signals from adjacent detector array elements may be summed and evaluated along with signal curves from each individual array element to account for situations where the concentration of light falls on a boundary between array elements, providing better measurement resolution.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to prosthetic knee devices which overcome certain limitations of existing knee prostheses, generally referred to as semi-constrained knee prostheses, and more specifically as posteriorly-stabilized knee prostheses. The present knee prosthesis provides for an expanded range of degrees of translational movement without substantially reducing the risk of inadvertent dislocation of the knee when implanted. The devices of the invention achieve the increased ranges of motion without requiring a substantial posterioral shifting of the points of contact between the femoral and tibial components. The prostheses of the invention also reduce the risk of breakdown of the underlying resectioned proximal tibia surface. B. Description of the Related Art When natural healing of a diseased or injured knee is not sufficient to return the affected knee to its pre-injury or pre-disease condition, a preferred alternative is knee replacement surgery where certain portions of the natural knee are replaced with implanted prostheses. There are numerous types of such prostheses. One general category of knee prosthesis is the semi-constrained knee prosthesis of which an example is the posteriorly-stabilized knee. When the cruciate ligament is removed during resectioning, a posteriorly-stabilized prosthesis must be used. These knees generally possess a femoral component with a recess capable of interacting with a protuberance (peg, post) from the surface of the tibial component in order to stabilize movement of the knee components. While such semi-constrained, posteriorly-stabilized knee prostheses have gained in acceptance in the medical community, certain limitations have been found with existing knees of this type. In certain prosthetic knees of this type, there is substantial risk of unwanted contact between the top of the peg and the roof of the recess. In most instances, were such unwanted contact to occur, the full weight of the upper leg and body would bear down on a small and relatively insubstantial surface (the superiormost surface of the tibial peg) not designed to carry such loads. In certain existing knees, this is avoided by lowering the height of the tibial peg. However, lowering the tibial peg increases the risk of an inadvertent dislocation event. In other existing prostheses, voids are left in the roof of the recess to prevent contact of the recess roof and the top of the tibial peg. In other designs of this general category, mechanisms are provided which upon flexing of the knee joint, cause the femoral component to move substantially posteriorly in relation to the tibial component. In certain instances this posterioral shift is required by a particular device, especially where the device is to be implanted in a resectioned knee which is not resectioned with an approximately 7° posterioral slope in the proximal tibial bone surface. In any case, such camming mechanisms increase the degree of flexure possible in those knee prostheses in which they are found and such increase flexure is generally desirable. However, in those knees where camming causes the contact points between the femoral condyles as they are nested in the tibial concavities to shift posteriorly, the tibial component must be designed to fully support the load on the knee joint at progressively more posterior positions as the knee translates through its full range of flexure and extension. Otherwise, where the tibial component does not properly support the load, softer plastic components will exhibit wear causing ultimate failure of the device and breakdown of the underlying resectioned bone surface. Where significant wear of plastic components occurs, disease conditions (osteolysis) may arise as a result of interaction of plastic particles and bone tissue. It is highly preferred to have knee prostheses with at least that degree of flexure observed in the natural knee so long as such may be achieved without increased risk of dislocation and without damage to the underlying bone surfaces. The natural knee is capable of at least several degrees of hyperextension beyond full extension without dislocating. In certain existing prosthetic knees, little if any provision is made for extension beyond normal full extension. In some instances, this lack of hyperextension ability is a result of the need in these designs to prevent dislocation of the knee joint before and at full extension. In some of these designs, the anterior surface of the tibial peg may be essentially vertical only obtusely angled in relation to the base plane of the tibial component, abruptly ending translation upon reaching full extension. It is highly preferred to allow for at least that degree of hyperextension observed in the natural knee so long as it may be achieved in the knee prosthesis without increased risk of dislocation. The threat of destroying the resectioned bone surface underlying a tibial implant is of equal concern along the lateral portions of the implant. In particular, such threats to lateral surfaces of the underlying bone when natural knee motions other than translational motion occur, such a lateral angulation (sometimes referred to as varus or valgus motion) consisting of a lateral sliding or rocking type motion. If the tibial component of the knee prosthesis fails to provide sufficient lateral support for such motions, the plastic components may wear and the outer edges of the bone surface underlying the unsupported tibial component medial/lateral extremes may exhibit cantilevering degradation. It is highly preferred that a prosthetic knee allow for those ranges of lateral motions which are exhibited by the natural knee so long as the medial/lateral edges of the tibial component of the prosthesis adequately protect against breakdown of the plastic components or the underlying surface of the resectioned proximal tibia. Knee prostheses are needed with expanded ranges of translational movement without increasing the risk of dislocation of the knee. Preferably, such prostheses will achieve greater ranges of both extension and flexure as those motions are exhibited by the natural knee, and will do so without requiring a substantial posterioral shifting of the points of contact between the femoral and tibial components. Where possible, such prostheses will also reduce the risk of breakdown of the plastic components or the underlying resectioned proximal tibia surface, medially, laterally, anteriorly and posteriorly. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention overcomes at least certain of these limitations of existing prosthetic knees by providing a knee prosthesis with an expanded range of translational movement without substantially increasing the risk of inadvertent dislocation of the knee when implanted. Moreover, it achieves these advantages without requiring a substantial posterioral shifting of the points of contact between the femoral and tibial components. Where possible, such prostheses will also reduce the risk of breakdown of the plastic components or the underlying resectioned proximal tibia surface. Generally, several principal characteristics of the devices of the present invention overcome the limitations recognized in prior art devices. As opposed to existing knee prostheses, the present invention provides a knee prosthesis whose femoral component (distal femur) has a pitched-roof which may interact with a relatively tall tibial peg thereby reducing risk of contact of the top of the peg and the roof of the recess during most of translation. The tibial peg is uniquely positioned with its posteriormost surface anterior of the middle of the tibial platform. This provides for a substantial increase in the degrees of flexure possible over certain existing knee prostheses. The tibial peg also has an acutely sloped anterior surface, which in combination with the anterior panel of the pitched-roof of the recess, allows an increase over the degrees of extension possible over certain existing knee prostheses. In combination, these structures provide for substantially increased degrees of translational movement without requiring any substantial amount of posterial shifting of the contact points between the femoral and tibial components. Because there is little posterioral shifting of these contact points, there is reduced risk of posterioral breakdown of the underlying bone surface. The present invention also provides a tibial component whose medial/lateral edges are less susceptible to medial/lateral cantilevering by virtue of a winged fixation post configured to provide greater medial/lateral support to the tibial component. More specifically, the knee joint prosthesis of the invention comprises two principal components--a distal femur and a proximal tibia. Each of these components has characteristics which contribute to the ability of the knee to provide a more natural knee-like movement without increasing risk of dislocation or breakdown of the underlying bone surface. The distal femur is used to replace the portions of the natural femur at its distal ends, including the natural distal condyles of the natural femur. The distal femur of the prosthesis has a pair of condyles which are separated and lie side by side. The condyles each have external surfaces which are curved in a convex fashion from their anterior to their posterior portions. The curved surface is one which is smooth throughout its dimension. The condyles are also convexly curved from side to side (laterally) in a similar smooth contour. These smooth convex contours are such that they substantially conform to the contour surfaces of a natural anatomical femur. Joining the condyles is a recess which is shaped like the roof of a house pitched from a peak sloping downwardly anteriorly and posteriorly along each roof panel. The recess has a pair of spaced-apart lateral walls supporting the pitched roof. The roof itself has an anterior roof panel and a posterior roof panel. The panels meet at a peak approximately equi-distant between the extreme edges of each roof panel. In certain embodiments, the roof panels form an included angle at the peak of approximately 146° to 154°. In yet other embodiments, the included angle is approximately 148° to 152°. In other embodiments still, the included angle is approximately 150°. In any of these embodiments, the vertex of the roof peak angle points superiorly and the resulting obtuse angle projects inferiorly. In certain embodiments, both the peak and each of the roof panels are concavely curved superiorly in order to increasingly prevent contact of the distal femur component with the proximal tibia component. The distal femur is preferably manufactured from cast cobalt-chromium alloy, although other materials known well to those of skill in the art of implantable knee prostheses will work as well. In certain embodiments, the bone-contacting surfaces of the distal femur component may be coated with Sinterlock CSTi® (U.S. Pat. No. 5,104,410) or other surface treatment to encourage fixation of the device to the bone such as plasma spray, bone cement (polymethyl methacrylate), hydroxyapatite, grit blast, fiber mesh, beads, or the like. The other principal component of the knee prosthesis is a proximal tibia. The platform is one having a pair of laterally separated concavities. These concavities provide for smooth motions resembling those motions of the natural knee including flexure and extension, when the condyles nest inside the concavities. A wedge-shaped peg is located on the superior surface of the tibial platform. The peg is positioned midway between the concavities. The peg is also positioned such that its posteriormost surface is anterior to the central portion of the tibial platform. The central portion is found by determining the position of the mediolateral line bisecting the platform. As implanted, the peg is mated with the pitched-roof recess of the distal femur in order to prevent excessive joint movements as is accomplished in the natural knee (albeit, in the natural knee, using tendons, ligaments, and cartilage discs). The structure of the pitched roof is such that contact between the roof and the top of the tibial peg is avoided throughout substantially all anteroposterior translation of the distal femur in relation to the proximal tibia. It is only beyond extension anteriorly or beyond flexure posteriorly that the roof panels contact any surface of the tibial peg, and then only the anterior or posterior surfaces, respectively.",

    "abstract": "The invention relates to a walking sole for sports shoes, in particular golf shoes, as well as to a shoe equipped with this kind of sole. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION There already exist shoe soles of which the edges are notched with grooves that are transverse in relation to the longitudinal axis of the shoe, in order to facilitate a relative torsion of the front part of the sole in relation to its rear part. For example, FR-A-1 218 101 describes a shoe whose walking sole is divided by means of several transverse grooves, which begin at the edges of the sole and are located in the area of the sole under the arch of the foot. These grooves are filled with a material possessing a degree of elasticity superior to that of the material forming the entirety of the sole. Moreover, FR-A-2 553 636 describes a shoe of which the middle sole has, along the front part of the exterior edge, grooves containing pieces made of a material of a hardness greater than that of the material making up the layer of the middle sole. This last arrangement is aimed basically at improving the flexibility and cushioning characteristics in the direction of the foot&#39;s motion during walking, running, or jumping. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention involves more particularly, a sole for golf shoes that is designed to facilitate the rotation of the foot during the &#34;swing&#34; movement, while at the same time guaranteeing an optimal grip on the ground. For this purpose, this walking sole for a sport shoe, in particular a golf shoe, has, in at least one of its lateral edges, a series of spaced approximately transverse grooves, extending to the edge of the sole and toward the central part thereof, the grooves being filled with a material having a degree of elasticity superior to that of the material making up the sole and which forms individual elastic filling pieces embedded in the respective grooves. The grooves are provided in the front part of at least one of the lateral edges extending along the front area of the sole, from which the front part of the foot of the wearer of the shoe gains its support, and these grooves form the boundaries of least one flexible tongue situated transversally around a line joining the internal ends of the grooves. According to another characteristic of the invention, each of the flexible tongues has attached to it at least one cleat designed to embed itself into the ground, this cleat being fastened permanently to the sole during its molding, or being fastened, after the molding of the sole, to an anchoring piece provided during molding and built into the flexible tongue.",

    "abstract": "The present invention addresses and resolves contemporary issues associated with stress measurement in a mammalian test subject by providing a method by which acute stress may be rapidly assessed. Thus, in accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, a method of determining relative stress level in a mammalian subject is provided. Said method comprising the steps of: determining a first (i.e., baseline) physiological stress level of the subject; administering one or more stimuli (e.g., product, task, aroma) to the subject, wherein said stimuli are intended to cause a change in the stress level of the subject; determining a second physiological stress level of the subject; and comparing said first physiological stress level and said second physiological stress level to determine the stress level of the subject. In another aspect of the present invention, the above-mentioned step of determining the stress level of a subject may be performed on a mammal. In another aspect of the present invention, the mammalian subject may be selected from the group consisting of: humans, cats, dogs, other domesticated animals and combinations thereof. In a particularly preferred aspect of the present invention, the level of stress in a mammalian subject may be assessed via measurement of one or more physiological characteristics of the mammalian test subject under consideration. As will be described more thoroughly hereinafter, said physiological characteristics may include, yet are not limited to: heart period, pulse transit time, peripheral blood flow, standard deviation of normal to normal beats (SDNN) and combinations thereof. In yet another aspect of the present invention, the level of stress in the mammalian subject may be assessed via the measurement of one or more psychological characteristics. In one aspect of the present invention, one or more psychological characteristics of the mammalian subject under consideration may be measured via the administration of a questionnaire to said subject, wherein one or more answers to questions from said questionnaire are designed to evaluate at least one psychological component of acute stress. Suitable questionnaires for purposes of the present invention include those which may be administered to the mammalian subject under consideration in a rapid manner to facilitate the swift assessment of the overall level of stress in said mammalian subject. In yet still other aspects of the present invention, the level of acute stress in a mammalian test subject may be assessed via measurement of one or more physiological characteristics and one or more psychological characteristics, the combination of which may be analyzed to determine an overall level of stress in said mammalian subject, as described more fully hereinafter. One advantage of the present invention is that the acute stress level of a mammalian subject may be assessed in a swift and accurate manner. Those skilled in the art to which the subject invention pertains will appreciate that the level of acute stress in a mammal is subject to rapid change, and thus, instantaneous measurement is requisite to the provision of meaningful stress level results for any given moment. The methods of the present invention are designed to quickly facilitate the measurement of acute stress in a mammalian subject, and thus, provide the practitioner of the present methods with measurements that more accurately reflect the level of stress in a mammal at the moment at which measurement of stress is intended. The accuracy of the methods disclosed herein is further bolstered via the simultaneous measurement of both psychological and physiological characteristics of a mammalian subject. Of course, another important aspect of the present invention is that the level of acute stress in a mammalian subject is measured in a non-invasive manner (particularly in comparison to blood, urine or saliva samples), thereby increasing the likelihood that a mammalian subject will subject themselves to administration of the present methods (particularly for consumer research purposes). Still other advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art to which the present invention pertains from the following description wherein there is described and shown a preferred embodiment of this invention in one of the best modes contemplated for carrying out the invention. As will be realized, the invention is capable of other different embodiments, and its several details are capable of modification in various, obvious aspects all without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the descriptions will be regarded as illustrative in nature and not as restrictive. All documents cited are, in relevant part, incorporated herein by reference; the citation of any document is not to be construed as an admission that it is prior art with respect to the present invention.

According to the present invention, there is provided an apparatus for supporting injection mixing work, comprising: a memory for storing data for supporting injection mixing work, the memory having a patient predictability data file for storing patient predictability data including at least patient predictable information, an injection prescription data file for storing injection prescription data corresponding to the patient predictability data, and a combination related data file for storing combination related data corresponding to each injection of the injection prescription data; a display for displaying the data stored in the memory; and a controller for controlling the display to display the patient predictability data stored in the patient predictability data file according to both the injection prescription data corresponding to the patient predictability data and the combination related data of each injection included in the injection prescription data. According to the present invention, because several kinds of data, with respect to the combination of injections, are displayed on the display, necessary information can be surely and quickly obtained, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the mixing work of injections. Preferably, the combination related data file of the memory stores pH-values data for each injection, wherein the controller decides a mixing order of the injections contained in the injection prescription data in accordance with the pH-values data, and wherein the controller displays the mixing order on the display. Thus, the mixing order of the injections can be automatically decided, thereby further enhancing the efficiency of the mixing work of injections. Preferably, the combination related data file of the memory stores differentiation data for differentiating a transfusion and a solely administrated medicament, and wherein the controller classifies the injection contained in the injection prescription data for a patient into transfusion or solely administrated medicament in accordance with the differentiation data and displays classified injection on the display. Thus, the medicament which can not be mixed can be differentiated, thereby further enhancing the efficiency of the mixing work of injections. Preferably, the combination related data file of the memory stores incompatibility data showing whether or not a combination of two kinds of injections is incompatible, wherein the controller decides whether or not a combination of two kinds of injections contained in the injection prescription data for a patient is incompatible in accordance with the incompatibility data, and wherein the controller displays such decisions to the incompatibility of combining different kinds of injections on the display. Thus, necessary information with respect to the incompatibility of the combination of different kinds of injections can be surely and quickly obtained, thereby preventing the generation of an injection which will not be able to be used as a result of mixing incompatible injections. Preferably, the combination related data file of the memory stores attention information data related to each injection, and wherein the controller displays an attention information in the attention information data on the display corresponding to each injection of the injection prescription data. Thus, when mixing the injections, detailed attention information can be confirmed in accordance with the displayed contents on the display, thereby enabling the operator of the apparatus to more effectively conduct the mixing work. Preferably, the apparatus further comprises a reader for reading an identification code for identifying each injection, wherein the controller displays a progress situation of the mixing work on the display in accordance with the identification code as read by the reader when conducting the mixing work of the injection. Thus, the mixing work can be effectively conducted with the displayed contents on the display confirming the progress situation, thereby enabling the operator of the apparatus to more effectively conduct the mixing work. Preferably, when conducting the mixing work of the injection in the mixing order as decided in accordance with the pH-values data, the controller decides whether the injection is proper or not in accordance with the identification code of the injection as read by the reader, and if the injection improper, the controller displays such information on the display. Thus it is possible to properly conduct the mixing work without failing, thereby surely preventing an error in the mixing procedure. Preferably, the apparatus further comprises an input device which is used to input new incompatibility data in addition to the incompatibility data stored in the combination related data and to store it in the combination related data of the memory.

    "abstract": "The invention relates to an in-tank fuel filter and method of making same. The fuel filter includes a novel fuel line fitting and seal construction. The filter has a fabric body composed of woven threads of nylon, Saran or similar material. Preferably, the fabric body is formed from a folded swatch of fabric. A spacing structure of rolled fabric, for example, disposed within the fabric body, prevents collapse of the filter and accompanying reduction of or interference with fuel flow. The fitting comprises a first segment disposed outside the filter which incorporates a fuel line retaining member and a second, mating segment disposed within the filter which incorporates a fuel line receiving aperture. The fitting segments are ultrasonically bonded to one another. Melting material from the segments creates a bead which flows into the interstices of the fabric and mechanically bonds and retains it within the segments of the fitting. The segments also include complementarily convoluted radially extending shoulders which grip the fabric and assist its retention in the assembled fitting. It is thus an object of the present invention to provide an in-tank fuel filter having a two-component fuel line fitting wherein the components are ultrasonically bonded together.

The present invention also relates to compositions useful in such methods. 2. Discussion of the Background The effort to look younger and less wrinkled, using cosmetic compositions containing active agents capable of combating aging, is on the increase. The anti-aging active agents commonly used are α-hydroxy acids (lactic, glycolic, citric), β-hydroxy acids (salicyclic, 5-n-octanoylsalicylic acid) and retinoids (all-trans- or 13-cis-retinoic acid, retinol). Unfortunately, these anti-aging active agents suffer from the major drawback of causing smarting, itching and sensations of tightness after their application, which can lead to considerable discomfort. Hence, the use of these compounds for users having sensitive skin is often ruled out. Thus, there remains a need for a method for combating aging which does not possess these drawbacks. There also remains a need for compositions which are effective for combating aging but do not cause smarting, itching or a sensation of tightness when applied to the skin.

More particularly, the present invention relates to minimally invasive intravertebral disc distraction, rotation, or translation, removal of disc and/or vertebral bone material, and subsequent fusion of a disc. 2. Description of Related Art There are five movable vertebrae in the lower back. This area is called the lumbar spine and is the flexible part of the back. Above the lumbar spine is the thoracic spine and below it is the sacrum and coccyx. Between each vertebra is a cushion referred to as an intervertebral disc. Each disc has a tough exterior rim of fibrous cartilage (similar to that of a radial tire), referred to as the annulus fibrosis. Within each disc is a resilient and “jelly-like” interior filling, referred to as the nucleus pulposus. The top and bottom of the disc are covered by relatively bony endplates. FIG. 1  is a partial cross-section view of a portion of the spine. As shown in this figure, an intervertebral disc D is positioned between adjacent vetebral bodies V 1  and V 2  and includes an annulus fibrosis A, a nucleus pulposus N, and end plates EP. Positioned on the vertebral bodies V 1  and V 2  are a superior articular process SAP, a pedicle P, an inferior articular process IAP, a spinal process SP, and a facet joint FJ. Each disc and the vertebra above and below it compromise a motion segment. Movement such as bending forward (flexion) bending backwards (extension) and twisting and turning (rotation) occur at these motion segments. Approximately 80% of the American population experiences various forms of lower back pain at some point during their lifetimes. Back pain is sometimes associated with intervertebral disc trauma, degeneration of the disc or joints in the spine, disc herniation, spinal instability, bone spurs, or inflamed ligaments. Back pain can also be caused by an injury, disease, malalignment, tumor, hereditary weakness, and previous back surgery. In addition, back and/or leg pain may be caused by pressure on the spinal cord or on a spinal nerve. Techniques for treatment vary from simple interventions such as rest and physical therapy to more complicated surgical procedures such as spinal fusions. (As used herein the term “fusion” refers in general to increasing the stability of a region of the spine, and does not necessarily require the physical joining of portions of the spine.) Some surgical techniques have improved to the point where invasiveness and trauma to non-spinal tissues can be kept to a minimum. Intervertebral discs commonly wear and tear, weakening their outer fibrous structure. Increasing pressure in the spine may bulge and even rupture the disc, causing back or leg pain. In normal aging, discs lose water and decrease their ability to function as “shock absorbers.” Narrowing discs increase stress to the facet joints. Instability or abnormal motion may occur in the advanced stages of arthritis or from trauma. Spondylolithesis is a forward slipping of one vertebra over another and may result of severe instability. Spinal stenosis, a narrowing of the spinal canal, may be a result of arthritis, putting pressure on the nerves or the spinal cord. Osteoarthritis may result in narrowing of the disc spaces and development of bone spurs on the vertebral bodies. Herniated discs are another form of injury to the intravertebral disc and are often referred to as “slipped discs.” This term is derived from the action of the nucleus tissue when it is forced from the center of the disc. The disc itself does not slip. However, the nucleus tissues located in the center of the disc can be placed under so much pressure that it can cause the annulus to be herniated or rupture against one or more of the spinal nerves which can cause pain, numbness, or weakness in the lower back, leg or foot. Other names used for herniated discs are “prolapsed,” “bulging,” or “ruptured.” Depending on the results of a physical examination and the severity of the condition, physicians commonly offer one of two forms of treatment. The first common treatment is “conservative therapy,” comprising bed rest, pain medication, and physiotherapy. If conservative therapy does not bring enough pain relief, surgical procedures are typically considered. The most common reason for recommending lower back surgery is to relieve either back or leg pain. To decrease leg pain, pressure is removed from the affected spinal nerve. Removal of a tumor, treatment of a fractured spine, and repair of malalignments are other reasons surgery is undertaken. In order to accomplish these objectives, the spine surgeon may remove the disc (discectomy) or a part of the lamina (laminotomy) or remove the whole lamina (laminectomy). The procedure is also referred to as a decompression because the pressure on the nerve or the spinal cord or cauda equina is removed. Sometimes motion between the vertebral bodies must also be stopped in an effort to relieve pain. In such cases, the surgeon may elect to perform a spinal fusion procedure. This procedure entails implanting pieces of bone graft, usually obtained from the patient&#39;s own iliac crest bone (hip). The bone graft is intended to encourage bone growth between the vertebral bodies and the posterior aspect of the spine. If the bone develops and grows between the vertebrae, then the spine segment is said to have “fused,” and the motion between the vertebral bodies is therefore eliminated. Fusion is best accomplished when the vertebrae are kept as motionless as possible during the healing process which is usually four to six months. Physicians may recommend achieving stability through additional internal fixation devices attached to the vertebral bodies during the surgical procedure. This may be performed with a combination of screws inserted meticulously into the vertebral body and attached to one another with a series of rods, plates, wires, or hooks. Until a few years ago, the only surgical treatment for herniated lumbar discs was the open removal of a part of the herniated disc, an often effective but major operation that requires general anesthesia, the dissection of muscle, removal of bone, and at times, bone fusion. These procedures increase the risk to the patient of post-operative complications. In recent years, techniques employing the use of endoscopy have been incorporated into lumbar spine surgery making minimally invasive spine surgery possible while overcoming disadvantages of traditional techniques. Endoscopic discectomy can provide an effective way to decompress and repair damaged discs without open surgery. An endoscope provides clear visualization and magnification of deep structures. First used in knee surgery, endoscopy (arthroscopy), with its advanced miniaturization and video imaging technology, has made it possible for a less invasive and less traumatic discectomy procedure for some disc patients. Endoscopic discectomy is an outpatient surgical procedure to remove herniated disc material. Using local anesthesia with the help of x-ray flouroscopy and magnified video for guidance, a small specially-designed endoscopic probe is inserted through the skin of the back, between the vertebrae, and into the herniated disc space. Tiny surgical attachments are then sent down the hollow center of the probe to remove a portion of the offending disc. The microsurgical attachments can also sometimes be used to push the bulging disc back into place and for the removal of disc fragments and small bony spurs. Endoscopic discectomy is different from open lumbar disc surgery because there is no traumatic back muscle dissection, bone removal, or large skin incision. The risk of complications from scarring, blood loss, infection, and anesthesia that may occur with conventional surgery are drastically reduced or eliminated with this procedure. Endoscopic discectomy was invented to be an effective treatment for herniated discs while avoiding these risks. A wide variety of spinal implants are available to the clinician for the surgical treatment of spinal disorders. Most of the implants are designed to promote long term fusion. For certain conditions, anterior fusion of the lumbar spine is a standard operation. Despite improvements in fusion techniques and reductions in the pseudoarthritis rate, improved procedures and devices are needed. Surgeons specializing in operations on the vertebral column necessarily incorporate laparoscopic surgery. Other concepts such as the biological enhancement of spinal fusion and alternatives to fusion such as artificial discs and interbody cage devices are the object of intense, multidisciplinary study. Despite these improvements, currently there are neither devices designed to distract the intervertebral disc percutaneously nor minimally invasive procedures to achieve spinal fusions. In light of the foregoing, there is a need in the art for improving procedures and devices associated with performing spinal surgery. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION",

    "abstract": "Stated generally, wheat glutens which tend to agglomerate excessively when dispersed in aqueous media are rendered non-agglomerating according to the invention by use of a finely particulate edible additive rich in protein which, when physically interposed between particles of gluten in the aqueous dispersion, interfere with and prevent the hydrogen bonding between the molecules of the protein of the gluten which would otherwise occur and cause agglomeration. Advantageously, the agglomeration-inhibiting additive is a finely particulate edible vegetable material having a substantial content of globular protein in undenatured form, typically a legume flour which has been produced under conditions which do not denature the native protein content of the flour. Soy flour in which the soy protein is undenatured is particularly advantageous. The gluten to be dispersed is employed in finely particulate form, with the average maximum particle dimension not exceeding 350 microns, and the agglomeration inhibiting additive is of a particle size such that the average maximum particle dimension does not exceed the same value. Though the additive can be introduced separately into the aqueous medium in which the gluten is, or is to be, dispersed, it is most advantageous to pre-mix the additive with the gluten to be rendered non-agglomerating, the dry admixture being dispersed in the aqueous medium in conventional fashion. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The invention is applicable to any finely particulate gluten which tends to agglomerate excessively when dispersed in aqueous media, and is particularly useful in connection with vital wheat gluten. The invention stems from the initial discovery that vital wheat gluten, exhibiting by itself an excessive tendency to agglomerate when agitated in an aqueous liquid, is readily dispersible in water when pre-mixed with a soy flour, the protein content of which has not been denatured, while pre-mixing with a soy flour treated to denature the soy protein failed to reduce agglomeration. The same results are achieved with peanut flour, navy bean flour, lentil flour, cottonseed flour and rapeseed flour, so long as the protein thereof is undenatured, as well as with the proteins isolated or concentrated in undenatured form from such materials. When the aqueous medium in which the gluten is to be dispersed does not contain a substantial amount of salt, the same results are also obtainable with dairy whey solids. Though higher proportions of the additive material can be employed without serious disadvantage other than lack of economy, best results are achieved when the soy flour or other agglomeration-inhibiting additive is included in an amount equal to 3-15% by weight, based on the total weight of the gluten and the agglomeration-inhibiting additive. It is of particular importance, especially when the protein material to be rendered non-agglomerating is vital wheat gluten, to employ that material in a particle size such that the average maximum particle dimension does not exceed 350 microns. When the particle size of the gluten is significantly larger, the effect of the soy flour or like proteinaceous additive in preventing agglomeration of the gluten is markedly reduced. It is advantageous to employ the gluten to be dispersed in a particle size such that most of the gluten has a maximum particle dimension smaller than 150 microns and no substantial proportion thereof has a maximum particle dimension larger than 350 microns. The average maximum particle dimension of the soy flour or other agglomeration-inhibiting additive should not exceed 350 microns in all events and, advantageously, is made to approximate that of the gluten. In particularly advantageous embodiments of the invention, the gluten is initially dry blended with the agglomeration-inhibiting additive to provide a uniform admixture of the two particulate solid materials. Alternatively, the gluten and the agglomeration-inhibiting additive are introduced separately into the aqueous medium in which the stable dispersion is to be established. While the invention is generally applicable to all procedures requiring establishment of a stable aqueous dispersion of gluten, it offers special advantages when applied to the problems presented by use of vital wheat gluten as an additive in the production of baked goods, either by the various batch procedures or by the continuous-mix method. With batch procedures, the gluten and the agglomeration-inhibiting additive can be dispersed in all or a portion of the water for the formula or can simply be added to the mix. When the sponge-dough method is used, the gluten and agglomeration-inhibiting additive can be added to the sponge, or to the dough, i.e., the &#34;remix&#34;, or to both. For the continuous-mix procedure or other procedures using an aqueous brew or broth, the gluten and the agglomeration-inhibiting additive can be dispersed in the water for the brew or broth, or in an amount of water held out of the brew or broth with the gluten dispersion then being added to the brew or broth at an appropriate stage. When employing the invention in connection with brews or broths containing substantial amounts of sodium chloride, more stable dispersions of the gluten in the brew or broth are obtained if the gluten and the agglomeration-inhibiting agent are first dispersed in a portion of the water for the formulation and the dispersion then added to the brew or broth, with the time of addition being so selected that at least three minutes of agitation time will still be available after the dispersion is added. Use of dairy whey solids is avoided when the brew or broth contains a substantial proportion of salt.",

    "abstract": "Numerous predator control methods have been placed in effect from time to time by ranchers, herders and governmental agencies in order to reduce or eliminate predator attacks. Among the various methods employed are traps, poison bait, and snares and shooting--to include shooting from helicopters and small aircraft. These predator control techniques have not been selective in that they indiscriminately kill members of i.e. the coyote species responsible for sheep attacks as well as innocent coyote, and the indiscriminate slaughter from wildlife predator control programs is unacceptable. Moreover, these predator control programs are expensive and often times not cost effective in eliminating the predator responsible for attacks on sheep herds. One object of the invention is to provide a combination audio and visual warning device to scare off a particular predator coyote without killing him, while simultaneously reducing the possibility of predator or coyote immunity. Another object of the invention is to provide a cost effective device for scaring off a particular predator coyote without killing him, and without causing damage to sheep. A yet further object of the invention is to provide an environmentally safe device for scaring off a particular predator, which is not harmful to the predator or other members of his species or wildlife. Another object further still is to provide a device for scaring off predators to sheep, which is light-weight easy to handle and imposes no restrictions as to where or how far the sheep can roam, and is capable of scaring off the predator only when an attack is either imminent or underway. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The individual sheep unit U-shaped sonic collar sheep protector device of the present invention is a combination audio/visual warning device, which is activated by sudden or startled sheep movement which typically occurs when the sheep is frightened or attacked. The device contains a light sensor so that the unit is activated during the night. This feature helps to prevent false alarms during the day when the sheep are more active and the predators are relatively inactive. The built in light sensing circuit also helps to conserve battery power by shutting the unit down during the day when the risk of attacks are low. In operation, a rancher fastens one of these U-shaped protector units around the neck of one out of every five sheep in a herd or flock, in a manner so that five or more different alarms are used in a herd. With five different alarms going off in a random order, and only during an imminent or present attack, experience has shown that the coyote or predator, is not rendered immune by a particular sound of the device. In bright sunlight, the unit is inactive. Upon dusk or low illumination, the light sensor or meter activates the unit to a ready mode. In the ready mode, a sudden movement activates a preselected motion detector, and thereupon, the entire unit. Once activated, the unit is preselected to sound (which may include a resonant frequency of about 23 KHz to hurt the predator&#39;s ears) on alarm for about 10 seconds while simultaneously flashing a strobe light 2 to 4 times. Thereafter, the unit is preselected to shut-down (cessation of alarm sounds and strobe lights) for 10 minutes in order to allow the sheep sufficient time to settle down from the frenzied activity set-off by the attack.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates generally to lumbar support devices and, more particularly, to lumbar support devices for use in thin packaging spaces. Lumbar support devices are well known in the art. Lumbar support is important for achieving an anatomically correct seating posture. If an individual does not receive proper back support, it can lead to lower back pain, increased muscle activation, increased tension on ligaments, and increased pressure on the spine. With the recent trend of car manufacturers reducing the packaging size available for the lumbar support mechanism, seat manufactures have been looking for ways to provide the needed lumbar support with thinner lumbar devices. As such, it is extremely important to develop a lumbar support system that is thin in packaging size but will provide appropriate lumbar support. The production of lumbar support though the use of a flexible seat suspension in combination with other elements has long been known in the art. However, the flexible seat suspension mechanisms used in the prior art only allowed the seat occupant to receive lumbar support at certain heights along the seat. As such, the occupant was not always able to have the greatest lumbar support at the exact height in which he/she desired. Rather, the occupant would have to settle for the location at which the lumbar was provided. Accordingly, there remains a need for a lumbar support system that is thin in packaging dimension and can provide an infinite number of heights at which lumbar support may be provided to the seat occupant. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is in view of the above problems that the present invention was developed. The invention is a lumbar support device having a flexible seat suspension, a cross member, and a pulley system actuated by a series of actuators and cables. In this system, the seat occupant may apply lumbar support in varying degrees at any position vertically along the flexible seat suspension because the support mechanism is allowed to slide along the side rails of the flexible seat suspension. As such, the occupant may receive lumbar support at the exact location in which it is desired. Furthermore, due to the use of the pulley system within this invention, the moving parts of the system may be actuated within a small dimension thereby assuring a small packaging size. Finally, this lumbar support system is less expensive to manufacture than most lumbar support devices because the pulley system allows the use of smaller, less expensive actuators and allows for an opportunity to use less expensive Kelvar wires instead of the normal steel cables. In the present invention, the flexible seat suspension is attached to the seat frame. A support mechanism is attached to the side rails of the flexible seat suspension via two slide elements. The slide elements allow the support mechanism to move vertically up and down the flexible seat suspension. The support mechanism consists of a cross member that is mounted on two sliding brackets which in turn are mounted on the seat frame. The cross member may move in a horizontal direction from a position further away from the flexible seat suspension to a position closer to the flexible seat suspension, and vice versa. Movement in the direction of the flexible seat suspension will force the flexible seat susDension to bend, thus providing support to the occupant at that location. An in/out wire moves the cross member in and out relative to the flexible seat suspension. The wire is run through a series of pulleys and along the backside of the cross member. When the actuator actuates the in/out cable wire, the cross member is moved forward towards the flexible seat suspension. When the actuator moves in the opposite direction, the pressure exerted upon the cross member is reduced such that the pressure exerted by the foam of the seat and/or the weight of the seat occupant will push the cross member in a direction away from the flexible seat suspension consequentially reducing the amount of support being applied to the seat occupant. The cross member also is connected to an up/down wire. The up/down wire runs in a diagonal direction across the back of the cross member. When the up/down wire is actuated, the movement of the up/down wire forces the cross member to move up or down the flexible seat suspension side rails. The diagonal design ensures that each side of the flexible seat suspension moves the same distance and at the same pace. The pulley system used in this invention provides many advantages. First, it assists in reducing the load of the actuators used within this lumbar device. As such, smaller, less expensive actuators may be used. Second, it transmits movement from the actuator to the moving parts of the cross member while avoiding interference with the foam of the seat or other seat components. Finally, the pulley system potentially allows for the use of a wire made of Kelvar. The Kelvar wire is cheaper and less resistant to breaking especially when used in conjunction with the plastic pulley wheels. In such cases when Kelvar wire is used, the plastic pulley wheels may even be fixed such that the wire merely slides along the path created by the pulley rather than turning around the moving wheel. Further features and advantages of the present invention, as well as the structure and operation of various embodiments of the present invention, are described in detail below with reference to the accompanying drawings.",

    "abstract": "The invention relates to a medical x-ray detection method, device and system, wherein an x-ray detector detects the presence of x-ray radiation in a medical environment, and a signal emitter emits a signal with respect to the detected x-ray radiation. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In many cases x-ray detection devices are used when registering x-ray images within the context of medical navigation. Such devices enable the determination of when (and therefore the relative position of the patient) the image was produced so as to allow the image to be correctly assigned within the context of navigation. It is of course in principle also possible to transmit the detection signal to a receiver via cable, e.g., to a further processing unit, such as a navigation system. Such cables, however, typically are laid or otherwise provided separate in the x-ray device or registration device and, therefore, necessitate additional interfaces on the signal receiving components, which increases overall system complexity. Another conventional approach for applications with analog x-ray image generating systems is to update the image information and to re-register when there are changes in the image contents. Such a system is known, for example, from EP 1 260 179 B1; however, many older or specific operating x-ray apparatus are still in use whose signal-to-noise ratio makes such a procedure difficult to implement or does not permit such a procedure. In cases in which the image is directly manipulated on the x-ray apparatus (e.g., scaled, rotated, flipped or contrast-enhanced), this could also lead to a “new” image being detected even though this is not the case. As a result, navigation problems may arise. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A signal emitter includes an active light-emitting signal means, and an x-ray detector, which is operatively coupled to the signal emitter. The x-ray detector can detect the start and/or end of x-ray radiation and provide the data to the signal emitter, wherein the signal emitter emits corresponding signals. In other words, the signal emitter emits an optical signal (e.g., active light emissions), which can be directly detected without time lag, such that the presence of the x-ray radiation can be reliably detected temporally. The signal means can include an LED and, in particular, can be an infrared emitter or an infrared LED. Using light in the infrared spectrum is advantageous in that disturbance by light flashes in the visible light spectrum have no effect on signal detection. It is noted, however, that the signal emitter also can function perfectly well with signal means that emit in the visible light spectrum. For example, it is conceivable to unambiguously identify the signal by the fact that it includes a particular signal sequence. When the “emission of light” is used within the context of the present disclosure, this includes visible light and/or non-visible light within the electromagnetic spectrum. Power for the signal means can be provided in different ways. For example, an internal or dedicated power supply, such as, for example, a battery or rechargeable battery, may provide power to the signal means. It is also conceivable to generate the power for the signal means from the x-ray detector itself (from the x-ray radiation energy) and to relay the power directly to the signal means. In such an embodiment, a corresponding converter may be used to convert the x-ray radiation energy to DC power, for example. In accordance with another aspect of the invention, a medical x-ray detection system can include an x-ray detection device such as described herein. The x-ray detection system also can include a fluoroscopic image registration unit, wherein the x-ray detector and the signal emitter are arranged on the fluoroscopic image registration unit. It is then possible to arrange the x-ray detector in the radiation transmission path of the fluoroscopic image registration unit. The x-ray detector, for example, can be arranged at a point at which it can reliably detect the presence of x-ray radiation. The signal emitter can be advantageously arranged on the outside of the fluoroscopic image registration unit, thereby enabling signal emissions to be easily detected by other externally mounted devices. It is also possible to arrange several signal emitters on the fluoroscopic image registration unit. Further, several x-ray detectors can be arranged on the fluoroscopic image registration unit. This establishes a redundancy and provides for fail-safe operation. The fluoroscopic image registration unit, for example, can include three signal emitters and three x-ray detectors. These emitters and detectors can be assigned to each other in any possible way. Further, it is possible to have a single x-ray detector control several signal emitters, or to have one signal emitter controlled by several x-ray detectors. Further, the one or more x-ray detection devices can be retrofitted or upgraded, wherein there exists the option of additionally providing a signal emitter or signal emitters and/or an x-ray detector or x-ray detectors on the fluoroscopic image registration unit such that they are attachable and detachable. Further, a medical x-ray detection system can be provided that includes an x-ray detection device as described herein, as well as an optical medical tracking system, such as an infrared tracking system. The signal emitter can be arranged within the detection range of the tracking system. This is advantageous as the optical signal emitter can be easily and directly incorporated into the tracking system environment. Since such optical tracking systems are available or used in many navigation environments, the detection signal can be easily detected, processed and integrated into the sequence. Such a system (comprising a tracking system) can of course also comprise the features described herein for the medical x-ray detection system. A method for x-ray detection includes detecting, via a detector unit, x-rays generated during treatment or treatment preparation. The information pertaining to the start and end of the radiation time can be relayed by an active component that can be embedded within an array of passive markers. The integration of passive and active light transmission is mutually supplemented here; both signals can be wirelessly transmitted and detected. While passive markers on a registration kit are perfectly sufficient for localizing such a kit, the active signal transmission for x-ray detection optimally supplements this information transmission. It is thus possible to incorporate trigger signals for the start or end of radiation, for example into a known navigation environment based on reflection marker technology. Integrating one or more x-ray detectors into the fluoroscopic image registration kit and supplementing the marker array of the kit with the signal emitter thus allows improved detection of newly acquired images, which incurs a high degree of reliability. Due to the control via this part of fluoroscopic image acquisition, all x-ray tracking or navigation systems can benefit from greatly reduced tracking errors. This applies to C-arm x-ray systems using analog image transmission (video), since the approach does not exhibit the drawbacks of purely software-based image comparison methods. The apparatus, system and method described herein is particularly valuable in the environment of an infrared tracking system or a navigation system, since it optimally and precisely utilizes available systems that include passive marker arrays and infrared cameras. An additional active infrared component (signal emitter) would be automatically detected by the camera system, wherein the wavelength of the infrared light is within the detection range of the camera system, and its position would thus be available for further evaluation. Such an integration can be simply implemented by a few changes in the software responsible for detecting other treatment devices or treatment-assisting devices comprising positional markers, and the application itself could implement the corresponding algorithms. No changes need be made to the existing hardware. Specifically for C-arm fluoroscopy apparatus having an analog transmission mode, automatic signal detection may be quickly and easily implemented. When the x-ray radiation is detected, the information from the image comparison, for example, can be supplemented with the trigger signal of the signal emitter. The exact time for storing the tracking information then can be ascertained from the coincidence criterion, in accordance with which both processes must take place at the same time, and within a very small time interval. A way of obtaining correct tracking information, which is more reliable in this way, also increases the safety and security of the patients.",

    "abstract": "My invention relates to tree trimming devices. More particularly, my invention relates to electrically powered tree trimming devices. More particularly, my invention relates to portable, electrically powered tree trimming devices which may be telescopically extendible to reach tree limbs or branches at different heights. Still more particularly, my invention relates to tree trimming devices having a cutting component on a distal end of an extendible base member with the cutting component actuable by power transmitted through a coiled cable within the base member. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Many tree trimming devices have been designed for pruning small branches from trees. Generally, tree trimming devices have been composed of cutting devices positioned atop extendible rods or poles in order to reach considerable distances through a small tree. The various tree trimming devices have been either manually operable or power-driven. For power-driven tree trimming devices, the source of the power has been either hydraulic, gasoline, or electric. The type of cutting mechanism for cutting small branches may be either some form of shear apparatus or saw type device, which may even be a saw blade or chain saw member. I have owned and used a particular type of manually-operated tree trimming device for many years, and consequently have become aware of certain disadvantages which I felt could be improved. The tree trimming device which I have used comprises an extendible tubular member having a lever operable cutting component at the distal end. The lever device extends radially from the tubular member. A long cord is attached to the leverable end of the cutting component, and the cord is longer than the tubular member to be grasped by the operator for activation. Then, a strong pull on the cord operates the cutting component. I have encountered several distinct disadvantages in the use of my manually-operable tree trimming device. For example: a. The manual trimmer requires a long, manipulating cord which extends loosely from the cutting component at the upper, distal end of the long tubular support member to the lower end of the tubular support member held by the operator. The lever operating the cutting component extends a considerable distance radially from the support member, and consequently the cord is held at a distance radially from the axis of the support member from the top of the support member to the lower end of the support member. Consequently, the cord very easily becomes entangled with many small tree branches as I try to maneuver the tree trimmer into suitable position among the many tree branches. b. The long, loose cord which operates the operating lever component requires the operator to grasp the cord firmly and pull with considerable force to sever the particular tree branch currently positioned within the cutting member. I estimate that each cutting action requires an arm movement of at least 2.5 to 3.0 feet to operate the cutting component because of the leverage built into the manual action of the device. Even though the operating component is constructed with considerable leverage, a strong pull is required and the operator&#39;s arm may soon become quite tired, and possibly even unduly injured if not handled with care. c. The manual trimmer, with all the components operating exteriorly of the device, requires a great deal of attention applied to the maneuvering and positioning of the cutting components, levers, and manipulating cord. I found that the attention given to the operating components detracts from important attention which should be given to the careful positioning of the operating component when there are power lines passing through or adjacent the tree which is being trimmed. Thus, in considering the possible manner in which a tree trimming device might be improved, I eventually developed the invention which I describe herein. In accordance with the usual practice, I have conducted a patent search which revealed the following patents which were considered to be the closest to my invention:",

    "abstract": "The present invention generally relates to fluid powered brushes. More specifically, a preferred embodiment of the present invention is directed to a toothbrush powered by water enroute to a shower. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It has previously been known to power a brush implement by water enroute to a shower or a faucet. Implements of this general nature are illustrated in the following patent documents. U.S. Pat. Nos.: 3,869,746; 4,282,623; 4,793,331; and 4,841,590. However, these earlier proposed fluid powered brush implements have numerous disadvantages associated therewith, several of which are enumerated below. For example, some known fluid powered brush implements draw off a significant portion or all of the fluid enroute to a shower or faucet to operate the same, thereby lessening or entirely eliminating the stream emitted by the shower or faucet. Moreover, systems of this type use a great deal more water in the operation thereof. The drive system for several earlier proposed fluid powered brush implements are designed to accommodate only a single brush head. This is disadvantageous in that multiple brush heads normally result in a more thorough cleaning. Furthermore, multiple brush heads provide the user with a pleasing stimulation not found in brushes having a single brush head. Finally, prior drive systems for fluid powered brushes having multiple brush heads are relatively inefficient. Drive systems of this type have an impeller fixed to each of the brush heads. The impellers are positioned on a common axis in the path of flow of the fluid. Thus, the force to drive the downstream impellers is substantially less than that for the upstream impeller resulting in slower rotating downstream brush heads. OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide an improved fluid powered brush overcoming the disadvantages associated with the prior art. Another object of the present invention is to provide a fluid powered brush for use with a fluid driven impeller which includes a body member having a horizontal axis and a brush means for scrubbing at least one portion of an individual&#39;s body. The brush means is positioned adjacent the body member. Connecting means is provided for drivingly connecting the brush means to a fluid driven impeller removed from the brush means along a horizontal axis of the body member. A fluid powered brush formed in the manner recited above is advantageous, for among other reasons, because the drive system thereof is more efficient than previously known fluid powered brushes. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a fluid powered brush system which includes a first brush having a body member and brush means for scrubbing at least one portion of an individual&#39;s body. The brush means is positioned adjacent the body member. The brush system further includes an impeller drive means adapted to be driven by a fluid for driving the brush means and connecting means for drivingly connecting the impeller drive means to the brush means. The impeller drive means is removed or offset from the brush means along a horizontal axis of the body member. By positioning the impeller drive means offset from the brush means along the horizontal axis of the body member, the fluid powered brush system can more efficiently drive multiple brush heads. A further object of the present invention is to provide a fluid powered brush for use with a fluid driven impeller which includes a body member having a handle and an operating head and brush means for scrubbing at least one portion of an individual&#39;s body. The brush means is positioned adjacent the operating head. Connecting means is provided for drivingly connecting the brush means to a fluid driven impeller positioned removed from the body member. One advantage of a fluid powered brush formed in the manner recited above is that no fluid need be drawn from the water enroute to a shower or faucet to power the brush, since the connecting means connects the brush means to the fluid driven impeller at a location remote from the body member. Yet still another object of the present invention is to provide a method of forming a fluid powered brush to be used with a fluid driven impeller which includes the steps of providing a body member having a handle and an operating head, providing brush means for scrubbing at least one portion of an individual&#39;s body, positioning the brush means adjacent the operating head and removed from a fluid driven impeller along a horizontal axis of the body member and providing connecting means for drivingly connecting the brush means to the fluid driven impeller. Because the brush means is positioned removed from the fluid driven impeller along a horizontal axis of the body member, the relative inefficiencies of previously known fluid powered brushes can be readily overcome. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a method of driving a fluid powered brush system which includes the steps of providing a body member having a handle and an operating head, providing brush means for scrubbing at least one portion of an individual&#39;s body, providing at least one fluid driven impeller, positioning the fluid driven impeller remotely from the brush means along a horizontal axis of the body member and providing a fluid supply means for supplying a fluid to drive the fluid driven impeller. The above method for driving a fluid powered brush system is desirable in that it readily avoids substantial discrepancies in the drive force imparted on the various brush heads. These objects and advantages as well as others will be readily apparent from the detailed description of the invention, the accompanying drawings and the attached claims. In summary the present invention generally relates to fluid powered brushes. A preferred embodiment is directed to a toothbrush powered by water enroute to a shower head. The toothbrush includes a handle and an operating head detachably connected thereto. A plurality of brush heads are positioned adjacent the operating head. A fluid driven impeller is disposed upstream of the outlet of the shower head. A flexible cable is connected at one end to the impeller and at the other end to the brush heads. The flexible cable rotates upon rotation of the impeller to drive the brush heads. A fluid powered toothbrush formed in accordance with the preferred embodiment of the present invention is adapted to efficiently drive multiple brush heads. Furthermore, no fluid need be drawn off the shower to power the toothbrush.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to automatic, forward-feed shelving having particular utility in the merchandising of bottled soft drinks and similar products, wherein articles are arranged on a shelf in columns extending rearwardly from the front edge of the shelf, and are automatically carried forward toward the front edge when the foremost bottle in a column is removed by a customer. The invention relates particularly to improvements in the means used for stopping the forward movement of the column of articles. Various forward-feed shelves have been proposed for use in the merchandising display of bottled soft drinks. One such proposal involves the provision of a shelf in which bottles arranged in a column on an inclined track slide forward toward the front edge of a shelf when the foremost bottle is removed. One problem with the use of an inclined track arises because of the differences in weights and frictional characteristics of soft drink bottles. Soft drinks are marketed in both glass and blow-molded plastic bottles, and the bottles are available in different sizes, for example one and two liter sizes. Because of these differences between bottles, problems have been encountered in the use of simple inclined tracks for gravity feed. If a glass bottle, which is generally heavier and more slippery than a plastic bottle of the same capacity, slides adequately on a given track, a plastic bottle may not slide at all on the same track. Conversely, if a plastic bottle is made to slide on that particular track by the use of an appropriately steep angle of inclination and an appropriate frictional characteristic on the supporting surface, a glass bottle may tend to slide too quickly on the same track, and may be damaged or even break when it reaches the front edge of the shelf at the lower end of the track. One possible solution to the problems caused by differences between soft drink bottles on the market is exemplified by U.S. Pat. No. 4,128,177, which issued on Dec. 5, 1978 to Raphael T. Bustos. Bustos describes a display rack having an array of conveyor belts which are disposed at an angle relative to the horizontal, and which reduce the adverse effects of the different weights and frictional characteristics of the soft drink bottles. In the operation of the apparatus described by Bustos, as a bottle is removed from the forward end of a column of bottles, the conveyor belt conveys the remaining bottles toward the front of the shelf in response to gravity acting on said remaining bottles. The remaining bottles are stopped by contact of the bottle in back of the lead bottle with a bumper rail provided at the front edge of the shelf. One difficulty with the use of a bumper rail to stop the movement of a column of bottles is that the bumper rail can cause damage to the labelling of the bottles, which is typically a foam plastic label in the case of glass bottles, or a paper label in the case of plastic bottles. Another problem arises if a rigid bumper rail is used, in that a rigid bumper rail tends to stop the foremost bottle in a column suddenly. Where a sudden stoppage occurs, the inertia of the bottles behind the foremost bottle may cause the bottles in the column to hit one another in backlash fashion, which may result in damage or breakage. The principal object of this invention is to provide an automatic, forward-feed shelf in which the possible adverse effects of a bumper rail are eliminated. It is also an object of the invention to provide an automatic, forward-feed shelf in which the column of bottles or other articles is brought to a more gradual stop in order to reduce the likelihood of damage by reason of inertia. The foregoing objects are accomplished in accordance with the invention in a shelf having a flexible conveyor belt by the provision of brake means in the form of one or more frictional pads located at a position underneath the conveyor belt and responsive to the presence of an article on the belt and above said position for stopping the movement of the belt. The pads frictionally engage the underside of the belt to retard its movement. The brake means in accordance with the invention can be used not only with continuous conveyor gravity-feed shelving, but can also be used in connection with spring-actuated or motor-actuated conveyor systems. The manner in which the foregoing objects are accomplished, and various other objects of the invention, will be apparent from the following detailed description, when read in conjunction with the drawings.",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A cataract is a condition in which an opacity develops in the crystalline lens of an eye or in the ocular envelope; the opacity may range from only slight to complete obstruction of the passage of light. The development of a cataract may lead initially to near-sightedness (myopia) in the affected eye (or eyes), and may progress to blindness if left untreated. Moreover, untreated cataracts can cause severe inflammation and/or glaucoma, and may even cause dislocation of the lens. Senile cataracts are an age-related phenomenon, occurring most commonly in human subjects who are fifty years of age and older, but age related cataracts also occur in the later lives of other animals, including species in other Families of Order Primates, as well as species from other Orders and Families of Class Mammalia, such as mice and rats (Order Rodentia), dogs (Family Carnidae), cats (Family Felidae), horses (Family Equidae), cows (Family Bovidae) and other higher mammals. Species from other non-mammalian Classes, such as birds (Class Ayes), are also affected by senile cataracts. Presently, cataract surgery is the only generally accepted treatment for cataracts (senile or otherwise), and for reasons that are self-evident, is performed almost exclusively only in humans. In cataract surgery, the affected lens is removed (excised) and replaced by a synthetic (generally plastic or silicone) intraocular lens. While this procedure typically provides human patients with at least 20/40 vision, it is not without its drawbacks. After surgery, the patient&#39;s mobility is reduced and his/her activity level must be somewhat suppressed for some time. Moreover, after cataract extraction surgery, some patients require an additional procedure to remove cloudiness that may develop within the posterior capsule. Glaucoma, retinal detachment, endophthalmitis and bacterial infection are all possible complications that may result from, and follow upon, cataract extraction surgery. Furthermore, some human patients may not be candidates for cataract extraction surgery, due to either a pre-existing medical condition or an unwillingness to undergo an ocular surgery, and animals suffering from senile cataracts are rarely candidates for cataract extraction surgery, since unlike human subjects, in most cases the extracted lens would not be replaced with a synthetic lens implant, so the animal would remain virtually blind in any event, and also due to the relatively high cost of such veterinary procedures. Accordingly, a method by which cataracts could be treated, in both humans and animals, by a non-surgical process would be a useful addition to ophthalmic medicine. Yet, despite much study of the cause and treatment of cataracts, a clinically useful, non-surgical treatment that retards the development of senile cataracts has thus far eluded researchers. It is therefore the principal object of this invention to provide a clinically useful, non-surgical treatment, having virtually no side effects or complications, to reduce the symptoms, or to prevent the development, of senile cataracts in the lens of the eye of a human or animal. It is another object of the present invention to provide a clinically useful, non-surgical treatment that will significantly retard the rate of development of senile cataracts, and thereby eliminate the need for many surgical cataract extractions. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a plant medicament having prophylactic and/or therapeutic properties with respect to the formation and/or progression of senile cataracts in the lens of the eye of a human or an animal. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention resides in the surprising discovery, determined through preliminary in-vivo experiments described hereinafter, that the use of an extract of  Capraria bifiora  effectively reduces or eliminates the lens opacity that typifies senile cataracts. It has also been found that the continued use of  Capraria biflora  effectively prevents the recurrence of senile cataracts in previously affected eyes, and also prevents the occurrence of senile cataracts in eyes at risk for developing such a condition. Methods of treating senile cataracts are provided, the methods employing an aqueous extract of  Capraria biflora  to treat a patient in need of treatment for senile cataracts. An ophthalmically stable aqueous solution appropriate for dispensing to the eye, for the prevention and/or treatment of senile cataracts, is also provided. The aqueous solution of the invention includes an extract of  Capraria biflora  in a therapeutically sufficient amount over time so as to prevent or retard the development of a cataract in a human or animal subject to which the composition is administered. The composition may be a topical preparation or other dosage unit form suitable for instillation in the human or animal eye topically, systemically, or intraocularly. Topical dosage forms may include liquid eye drop preparations or ointments that may be instilled externally to the eye, or adsorbed into a material such as a soft contact lens or a collagen corneal shield. On the other hand, intraocular administration may take such forms as periocular injection or intraocular instillation (for example, by implantation of an intraocular reservoir). The methods of the invention include methods for inhibiting or preventing the development of a senile cataract, or for inhibiting the progression of an incipient senile cataract, in a human or animal subject, which methods comprise administering to such a human or animal subject an aqueous extract of  Capraria biflora  in a therapeutically sufficient amount to prevent or retard the development of a senile cataract in such a subject. In one embodiment of the invention, an extract of  Capraria biflora  is applied to the affected eye which treats an existing senile cataract. In another embodiment, the continued use of such an extract effectively prevents a senile cataract from recurring in the affected eye. In yet another embodiment of the invention, such an extract is used as a prophylactic treatment to reduce the risk of developing a senile cataract. In a further embodiment of the invention, such an extract is used in conjunction with ocular surgery, e.g., a patient with a severe senile cataract may first be treated with such an extract to diminish the severity of the cataract, which is subsequently removed using conventional ocular surgical techniques. In yet another embodiment of the invention, such an extract may be used post-operatively. These and other objects, aspects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from, and will be understood more clearly by reference to, the following detailed description of the presently most preferred embodiment thereof.",

In order to solve at least one of the above problems, according to an aspect of the present invention, there is provided a surgical tool guide including: a body a lower end of which is opened and having an upper portion with which at least one surgical tool entrance is communicated; a support ring located at a lower side of the body to be freely deformed and restored; a protection tube one end of which is fixed to the body to extend downward and an opposite end of which extends upward toward an upper side of the body while accommodating the body therein via the support ring; and a pressing ring fitted around the protection tube that extends upward, configured to press the body downward to lower the body relative to the protection tube, and selectively fastened to the body when the body is pressed. Here, a ring periphery portion supporting the pressing ring may protrude from the opened lower end of the body. A stopping boss may protrude from an outer surface of the body and a boss holder into which the stopping boss is inserted may be formed on an inner surface of the pressing ring, so that the pressing ring is selectively fastened to the body as the stopping boss is inserted into or separated from the boss holder according to horizontal rotation of the pressing ring while the pressing ring presses the body. A passage opening through which the stopping boss passes may be formed on a lower surface of the pressing ring. According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a surgical tool guide including: a body a lower end of which is opened and having an upper portion with which at least one surgical tool entrance is communicated; a support ring located at a lower side of the body to be freely deformed and restored; a protection tube including an inner tube fixed to an inner surface of the body to extend downward, and an outer tube connected to the inner tube, extending upward via the support ring, and fixed to an outer surface of the body; and a gas inlet formed in the inner tube and configured to introduce gas into a sealed space between the inner tube and the outer tube to expand the protection tube. The surgical tool guide may further include: a gas outlet formed in the outer tube and provided with a discharge valve to discharge the gas filled in the sealed space. The surgical tool guide may further include: a support ring pulling string connected to the support ring and extending outward via the sealed space and the body. A folding portion having a small thickness to be easily folded may be formed in the support ring in a predetermined section. According to yet another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a surgical tool guide installed in an operation hole of a patient perforated during an endoscopic operation to safely guide various surgical tools introduced through an upper tool entrance into an abdominal cavity, wherein the surgical tool guide is fixedly installed in the tool entrance while sealing and surrounding an upper end of the tool entrance and formed at a center of an upper surface thereof with a tool entry hole for entry of the surgical tools, and the surgical tool guide is formed of a flexible resilient material which is freely deformed and restored so that the tool entry hole is engaged with the surgical tools while adhering to the surgical tools even when the introduced surgical tools are moved. Here, an inner surface of the protection cap may be spaced apart from the tool entrance to surround the tool entrance while forming a predetermined marginal gap therein. An embossing portion having a plurality of bosses in a predetermined radial range from the tool entry hole may be formed on an upper surface of the protection cap. The thickened portion having a section having a large thickness in a predetermined radial range from the tool entry hole may be formed on an upper surface of the protection cap. A fixing member may be integrally formed at a lower end of the protection cap, and may be coupled and fixed by a coupling ring while being inserted into the tool entrance.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to devices that may be used to deliver therapeutic fluids to surgical wounds. More particularly the invention relates to functional sutures that may be used to emit therapeutic or bioactive fluids to the tissue surrounding the suture. In particular, the invention relates to a braided suture having an internal passageway capable of conducting a fluid along at least a portion of the length of the suture that may be attached on one end, through a connector, to a fluid source. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Much benefit could be realized by delivering therapeutic fluids to the direct vicinity of the surgical wound. Reduced pain, enhanced wound healing, and reduced occurrence of surgical site infections are but a few potential benefits. However, the form and function of a device that could cost-effectively facilitate localized delivery of therapeutic fluids directly to the wound site over an extended period of time are not apparent. Intravenous (IV) delivery of medication to the patient following a surgical procedure is common practice. The physician may use an IV to deliver a wide variety of medications directly to the patient&#39;s blood stream over an extended period of time. Intravenous (IV) administration of medication is indeed a systemic method of drug delivery where the medication will circulate through the entire body before a portion of the medication is delivered to the wound site. Since much of the medication may be metabolized at other locations within the body before reaching the wound site, it is often necessary to increase the overall amount or concentration of medication to be delivered systemically with an IV in order for an efficacious amount to reach the wound site. However, in many cases, the increased concentration of medication that may provide the most efficacious result at the wound site, may not be safely delivered through an IV since toxic side effects may occur at various organs within the body. Other medications, such as certain local anesthetics, only provide an efficacious result when delivered locally and are simply not compatible with IV delivery methods. Multiple injections in and around the surgical wound, before, during and after surgical procedures have been used in an effort to deter side effects and complications associated with surgical procedures. Although the syringe and hypodermic needle provide a means for localized drug delivery, the continuous delivery of medication via injection over an extended time period is not practical. Indeed, over time the medication dissipates to a concentration below that required to achieve a therapeutic effect and additional injections must be prescribed. Moreover, in the case where the surgical wound is the local target for drug treatment, multiple injections around the wound site may be required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. The patient may suffer discomfort and repetitive disturbance if multiple injections must be repeatedly administered. As a further draw back, with this approach, the health care professional must dedicate their valuable time and attention to repeatedly apply localized injections. In order to address the aforementioned shortcomings of the IV and injections for the localized and continuous delivery of therapeutic fluids, a number of specialized infusion catheters for use in the wound site have been developed. These specialized infusion catheters typically exhibit multiple perforations along their lengths and are connected to a reservoir and pump that contain and feed the therapeutic liquid to the infusion catheter, for example as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,458,582, 5,891,101 and 6,626,885. The infusion catheter itself may be placed directly into the surgical incision and held in place by closing the wound around it. However, a greater risk of infection and compromised wound healing may be associated with this deployment method since the infusion catheter may serve as a pathway for pathogens to enter the surgical incision. More commonly, the infusion catheter is passed through the skin and subcutaneous tissue in the vicinity of the wound, leaving the tip of the catheter within the surgical incision and the body of the catheter in healthy tissue surrounding the wound. It is important to note that the implantation of an infusion catheter in this manner commonly requires the use of a cannula to puncture and guide the infusion catheter though the skin and subcutaneous tissue and into the surgical incision site. Although these catheters provide a means of continuously delivering a therapeutic fluid to the wound, a number of drawbacks exists. Many devices such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,626,885 require the use of cannulas and additional puncture wounds in the vicinity of the surgical wound to firmly secure the catheter in place, while others described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,891,101 and 5,458,582 require the use of additional sutures or a modification of the suturing procedure. Even so, the infusion catheter may not be firmly anchored and accidental removal of the catheter from the wound site by the patient is not uncommon. Alternatively, in order to reduce patient discomfort and other complications associated with catheter removal, some catheter devices such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,458,582 may be produced from bioabsorbable materials. However, the implantation of bioabsorbable catheters increases the amount of material that must be absorbed and metabolized by the body, and it is generally desirable to keep this bioburden to a minimum. Finally, there are significant additional costs, ranging from hundreds to thousands of dollars, associated with the use of these specialized catheters and the supporting reservoirs and pumps that must be employed for their operation. A suture that could be used for localized and continuous drug delivery could satisfy the unmet needs of the aforementioned devices. The suture is implanted into the tissue surrounding the wound, which is indeed the region that may benefit most from localized drug delivery. Further, since the suture must be present in most cases to achieve wound closure, the number of invasive procedures that a patient must suffer is not necessarily increased. Moreover, suture needles attached to one end of the suture may be used to penetrate tissue surrounding the wound and facilitate placement of the fluid infusing suture. The suture may be secured in the wound by making a knot in one end to prevent accidental removal. Moreover the flexibility exhibited by a suture is considerable greater than the flexibility exhibited by infusion catheters, consequently, the suture may be placed in a complicated pattern or in locations that would be hard to reach with a conventional infusion catheter. Although a number of benefits may be achieved if drug delivery from a suture were possible, the form and function of such a device is not apparent. The concept of hollow monofilament sutures was first disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,918,455. Although this patent focused on the use of hollow sutures to facilitate attachment to the suture needle, it was also suggested that the bore of the hollow suture could be filled with a fluid at the time of its installation to expedite dissolution of the suture material or render the suture visible by X-radiography. It was further suggested that the tube could be so extruded and drawn to be converted into a microporous state. In this state, the polymer comprising the wall of the hollow suture would permit fluid contained in the bore of the suture to gradually diffuse through the wall into the surrounding tissue. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,984,933 an apparatus for suturing tissue has been described. Although the patent focuses on a method and device to facilitate endoscopic suturing, it was suggested that the suture material of the device could be solid or hollow, and when the suture material is hollow, small holes in the wall of the suture can be formed to enable medicaments contained in the bore of the suture to leach out into the surrounding tissue. Although these patents suggest that hollow sutures may be used to contain, and in some embodiments even slowly emit a therapeutic fluid, there are some critical shortcomings that remain unaddressed. First of all, monofilament sutures are flaw sensitive. The introduction of pores or perforations into the wall of the hollow suture may result in a substantial decrease in the strength performance of the suture and lead to its inability to insure secure closure of the wound. Secondly, the amount of medicine that may be contained inside of a hollow suture is small. Indeed the maximum amount of drug bearing solution that may be contained within most hollow sutures is on the order of 0.005 ml or less, whereas many commercially available drug bearing solutions are efficacious only in quantities in excess of 1 ml. For example, anesthetic agents such as marcaine, lidocaine, bupivacaine, mepivacaine and procaine are typically injected into the tissue surrounding an incision or wound in a buffer solution at an overall volume ranging from 5 to 30 ml, which is 500 to 3000 times greater than the dose that is applicable with the hollow sutures disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,918,455 and 5,984,933. Finally, once the hollow suture is implanted into the tissue surrounding the wound, the drug delivery rate is dictated by the rate at which the fluid leaches or diffuses through the multiple perforations or pores. Active control of the drug delivery rate and continuous drug delivery are not possible. Furthermore, if an adverse reaction to the drug occurs, the suture must be excised from the wound to terminate drug delivery. U.S. Pat. No. 4,159,720 describes a means for infusing liquids into tissue. The preferred embodiment comprises a reservoir for containing fluids attached outside the body that feeds liquid to an absorbent wick. The absorbent wick may be made from materials commonly used in the manufacture of sutures and may be installed in the tissue in a variety of ways including placement inside of the incision or deployment in the tissue surrounding the wound. The invention relies on capillary action to draw fluid in and control the delivery rate. As such, fluid delivery rate may not be increased or decreased at the physician&#39;s discretion. Moreover, the rate of fluid influx will depend on the type of wicking material used and the thickness and length of the wick installed. It is also important to note that in the cases when the suture is comprised of a material or is coated with a material that is not wetted by the fluid, wicking action will not occur and the device will not function. Even when the fluid to be delivered does indeed wet the wick, one may expect the fluid delivery rate driven by capillary forces that may be evolved within a suture to be several orders or magnitude slower than fluid delivery rates achievable by other means such as IV, infusion catheter, or injection. It may be desirable to have of a suture that serves the multiple functions of wound closure and drug delivery. However, unlike the aforementioned examples of prior art, the suture should: 1) not compromise critical performance characteristics such as strength of the suture, 2) enable delivery of an efficacious volume of drug bearing solution on the order of milliliters not microliters, 3) provide a high level of drug delivery rate control and enable the physician to start or stop drug administration at his/her discretion, 4) provide a means of providing more than one type of medication that may be selected post-surgically in accord with unexpected patient symptoms that may arise, 5) function regardless of the composition and wetting characteristics of the suture material. A suture that satisfies the aforementioned criteria for wound closure and drug delivery is disclosed herein. It is important to note that while the device disclosed herein may be used in a multifunctional manner to close wounds and infuse fluids to a wound site, simpler applications where the suture acts solely as an infusing device are likewise possible and useful. Components of the suture may include a connector designed to join a fluid reservoir, such as an IV, or syringe, or infusion pump to a braided suture that contains at least one internal passageway capable of conducting a fluid along at least a portion of its length. The therapeutic fluid passes from the reservoir, through the connector, into the internal passageway and into the interstices between the multiple filaments of the braided suture. The integrity of the braided suture is not compromised in the design of this device and critical performance characteristic such as suture strength are maintained above United States Pharmacopia, USP, standards. By employing a connector to link the fluid conducting element of the suture to an external reservoir, the amount of therapeutic fluid that may be delivered through the suture may be increased to a volume that is efficacious. Moreover, by regulating the supply of therapeutic fluid, the drug delivery rate may be actively controlled and more than one type of medication may be supplied as needed.",

    "abstract": "The invention relates to a targeting device for use with bone fixation devices. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In the case of bone fixation devices, particularly bone plates, the problem arises of fastening these devices by means of suitable, longitudinal bone fixation means, such as bone screws, bone wires, bone pins or Kirschner wires, to the bone fragments, so that the longitudinal bone fixation means have a particular direction with respect to the bone fixation device, especially, a specific angle to the bone fixation device. This problem arises principally in the case of bone plates, which consist of a plastic and do not yet have any plate boreholes, for example, the bone plate of International patent publication WO 01/012081. A device with a centering sleeve for setting the bone fixation means at a plastic plate is known from the German publication DE-U 200 19 026. This known device comprises a targeting bracket, at which a bone plate can be attached by fastening means, and a guiding part, which can be shifted at the targeting bracket and shifted and rotated relative to the bone plate. The single guiding part is tubular in construction and serves to center and guide surgical instruments and/or implants. The tubular configuration of the guiding part permits only one bone fixation means to be accommodated. In the event that, for example, several Kirschner wires are to be set at one bone plate, the guiding part must be shifted and aligned once again with respect to the targeting bracket for each Kirschner wire, which is to be set. This results in the expenditure of much time for setting, for example, four Kirschner wires. The invention is to provide a remedy here. It is an object of the invention to create a targeting device, which, on the one hand, permits drilling instruments or drill guide sleeves to be positioned in a previously determined direction with respect to the bone and/or, on the other, permits the surgeon to bring longitudinal bone-fixation means (Kirschner wires) into the bone in a previously determined direction, preferably in a direction in which they diverge from one another. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Pursuant to the invention, this objective is accomplished by a targeting apparatus for guiding fixation elements relative to a bone fixation device comprising a targeting bracket formed of a connecting portion having a first end and a second end, the first end configured and dimensioned for attachment to the bone fixation device, e.g., bone plate, and a handle portion disposed at the second end of the connecting portion. A first centering part is disposed at the first end of the connecting portion, the first centering part having a first guide for aligning a longitudinal bone fixation element relative to the bone fixation device. A second centering part is disposed on the handle portion, spaced from the first centering part, the second centering part having a second guide for aligning a longitudinal bone fixation element relative to the bone fixation device, and n the first and second guides are coaxial with one another and form a first guide pair. The advantages, achieved by the invention, are to be seen essentially therein that, due to the inventive targeting device: the longitudinal bone fixation means can be positioned precisely by the surgeon without previously having to implant a Kirschner wire in the bone;   the position of the Kirschner wires is predetermined clearly by the surgeon without previously having to implant a Kirschner wire in the bone;   the position of the Kirschner wires is predetermined clearly by the anatomy of the humerus and the position selected underneath the axillary nerve and becomes reproducible due to the targeting device (this is not the case with a targeting device, which permits the user to select the positioning freely); and   the bone fixation element can be implanted as well as explanted.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to the art of food ovens and more particularly to the art of conveyorized ovens designed for cooking food products as the same are moved by a conveyor from one end of the oven to the other. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Conveyorized heaters are known to art. Such heaters have been employed in the furnace art and in the food art. It is the latter with which the present invention is particularly concerned. One type of conveyorized food cooking device is the popular hamburger broiler in which rollers or a conveyor chain transports meat patties over heating elements. The heat source may be electric elements, gas burners or charcoal. Refinements for this type of device include automatic arms for turning the food product over to broil the reverse side. Conveyorized ovens are also known which simultaneously cook both surfaces of the food product. One known conveyorized baking device employs a conveyor belt for moving food products through a heating chamber, heat being provided by a plurality of electric heating elements located above and below the conveyor belt. The conveyor belt itself is stainless steel and is driven by a driven roller at one end of the belt. The speed of the drive roller may be controlled to vary the cooking speed. A similar type of oven is disclosed in Williams&#39; U.S. Pat. No. 3,515,854 issued June 2, 1970 for &#34;Conductive Baking Oven.&#34; In this patent, a continuous chain mesh conveyor carries food product through a baking chamber. The chain passes over a heat sink plate within the chamber and radiant heating rods are provided at the top of the heating chamber. Zone heating is provided by control of both the plate and the rods. It is disclosed in this patent that no convection heating currents are present. Yet another type of radiant heater is disclosed in Silberman&#39;s U.S. Pat. No. 3,239,651 issued Mar. 8, 1966 for &#34;Heating Unit.&#34; The device disclosed in this patent is superimposed over a conveyor for bread pans and is adapted for warming same prior to proofing. Radiant heating elements and reflective panels are provided for surrounding the pans and a fan blows air around the panels and between the panels and the outside housing to cool same. In Stephens&#39; U.S. Pat. No. 2,431,207 issued Nov. 18, 1947 for &#34;Continuous Bake Oven&#34; a heat source is provided below a continuous baking conveyor, the height of which may be adjusted to properly compensate for top and bottom baking temperatures. A fixed hearth is disposed intermediate the conveyor and the heat source, with ducts for circulating air which impinges on top of the baked products. One additional type of prior art oven employs a continuous chain mesh conveyor to transport food through a heat chamber. The conveyor is speed and direction controlled and the heat may be adjusted at different zones within the oven. Heating is provided through venturi like jets located above and below the conveyor. Air, heated by gas or electricity, is forced through the jets onto the food product. This oven includes some recirculation of air from the heater to the product to minimize flue or vent loss. All of the above ovens suffer from one or more disadvantages, the most important of which relate to cooking efficiency and energy consumption. Units which employ belt conveyors have a tendency to spill a considerable amount of heat requiring hoods and vents to maintain a surrounding environment suitable for workers. This also results in large power consumption and increased cost. Moreover, the use of radiant heating or convection heating as the sole heat source makes cooking impractical in those food outlets where the amount of product to be cooked varies substantially at different times of the day. Accordingly, a need exists in the art for a conveyorized oven which overcomes the above-noted disadvantages of the prior art. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a conveyorized oven which overcomes the above-noted disadvantages of the prior art. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a conveyorized oven which employs live rollers to convey food products through a cooking chamber. A still further object of the invention is to provide a conveyorized oven which includes heat recirculation to minimize heat loss. A further object of the present invention is to provide a conveyorized oven which is energy efficient and which does not require venting. Another object of the present invention is to provide a conveyorized oven in which the speed of travel of the products through the cooking chamber and the heat generated by the two types of heating devices may be controlled to insure proper cooking. Another object of the present invention is to provide a conveyorized oven which in one embodiment includes a pair of parallel conveyors with controls to select one or both lines depending on the demand for cooked food products. Another object of the present invention is to provide a conveyorized oven which employs two different type of heating to assure proper cooking of the top and bottom of the food product. How these and other objects of the invention are accomplished will be described in the following specification taken in conjunction with the FIGURES. Generally, however, the objects are accomplished by providing a conveyorized oven which employs live rollers to transport food products, such as pizza, through a baking chamber.

    "abstract": "This invention relates to a new and improved device for cracking nuts and more particularly, to a nutcracker which operates to crack nuts without scattering hulls or shells. The nutcracker of this invention may be operated without the necessity of being clamped or otherwise secured to a bench or tablet and, it is portable, light in weight, and is capable of simultaneously carrying both a supply of nuts to be cracked and a quantity of cracked nuts. The nutcracker is simple and easy to operate and prevents the scattering of hulls and shells during the cracking operation by containing the nuts in an enclosed cracking chamber, which enhances the utility of the device indoors. The nutcracker can be used to crack substantially any nut which will fit inside the cracking chamber, and may be designed and adjusted to accommodate the cracking of nuts of varying size and description. 2. Description of the Prior Art Heretofore, various devices have been developed to crack nuts, most of which are equipped with a cracking mechanism consisting of cracking jaws and at least one cracking lever. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,713,468 to Carol H. Walsh discloses a nutcracker having a hollow guide cylinder containing a piston which reciprocates inside the cylinder with respect to an adjustable jaw to facilitate cracking of a nut placed between the piston and the jaw. The nutcracker is lever-operated, the lever being attached to the piston in order to apply pressure on the nut to be cracked. Furthermore, in U.S. Pat. No. 2,804,111 to P. C. Burchett, a manually operated nutcracker designed essentially in the shape of a pair of pliers is disclosed, with a nutcracking chamber and a pair of jaws cooperating with a pair of levers to facilitate the necessary cracking pressure. Conventional nutcracking devices are characterized by many undesirable features. For example, nutcrackers of the piston design generally require some external stabilizing means since operation of the lever with sufficient power to crack nuts requires that the frame be clamped or otherwise firmly mounted to a strong support. Another disadvantage inherent in nutcrackers of this design is the problem of excessively cracking the nut since no means is provided for preventing the travel of the piston toward the jaw even after the nut is sufficiently cracked. Accordingly, if the shell happens to be quite hard and sufficient force is applied to crack it, this force frequently results in excessively crushing the meat in the nut. Hand nutcrackers are frequently subject to the limitation of requiring considerable pressure on the handgrip members to achieve sufficient power to crack the nut. Accordingly, nuts having thick shells such as walnuts and hickory nuts would be very difficult if not impossible to crack utilizing such devices because of the limited amount of leverage which can be realized by squeezing the handgrips together to achieve cracking. Furthermore, removal of nuts from the cracking chamber would appear to be somewhat cumbersome where positioning springs located inside the cracking chamber are used, since the springs tend to force the nut in an upward position against the upper cracking member, thereby making removal of the cracked nut difficult. Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide an improved nutcracker which is portable, does not require mounting or clamping to be used, and is equipped with a built-in tray to store both uncracked and cracked nuts both during the cracking operation and when the nutcracker is not in use. Another object of the invention is to provide a new and improved nutcracker having an enclosed cracking chamber which operates to prevent the scattering of hulls and shells during the cracking operation, thus enabling the nutcracker to be used inside the home, in an automobile or elsewhere under circumstances where the scattering of shells would be undesirable. A still further object of the invention is to provide a new and improved nutcracker which is equipped with an adjustable cracking lever and a rear base member which permits the cracking operation to be achieved by a sharp blow to the cracking lever rather than by an unregulated pull or jerk as in many conventional nutcracking devices. Yet another object of the invention is to provide a new and improved device for cracking substantially any nut, which is adjustable to accommodate nuts of varying sizes and shapes and to achieve a clean cracking of the nut shell or hull to enable the meat to be removed in large pieces with a minimum of crushing. Another object of the invention is to provide a new and improved nutcracker which is functional and yet pleasing in appearance, and which therefore functions as a decorative item either alone or with a supply of nuts, as well as operating efficiently to crack nuts. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION These and other objects of the invention are provided in a nutcracker for cracking nuts without scattering hulls or shells which includes the following elements. 1. A tray for storing both cracked and uncracked nuts; 2. A base member, including a cracking block, adapted to seat a nut to be cracked and hold it firmly in place during the cracking operation; and 3. A cracking lever and flange combination in hinged cooperation with the base member to form a cracking chamber within which nuts may be cracked by operation of the lever without the scattering of hulls or shells.",

    "abstract": "The present invention is directed to a method and apparatus for the three-dimensional presentation of an examination region of a patient in the form of a 3D reconstruction image. 2. Description of the Prior Art The three-dimensional presentation of an examination region of a patient in the form of a 3D reconstruction image is becoming increasingly important in the framework of medical examinations or treatments. Examples are minimally invasive treatments using endoscopes, laparoscopes or catheters that are respectively introduced into the examination region of the patient via a small body opening. On the basis of the 3D reconstruction image, the physician is provided with a three-dimensional view of the examination region, for example of the heart, which is useful to the physician for the navigation of the medical instrument. Such 3D reconstruction images, however, also are useful in instances wherein no instrument is to be introduced and only a presentation that serves for diagnostic purposes is required. Preoperatively acquired 3D image datasets, i.e. datasets that were acquired an arbitrary time before the actual examination or treatment, often are employed for the reconstruction of a 3D reconstruction image. Particularly when the 3D reconstruction image is employed in the context of ongoing intervention, difficulties can occur due to anatomical conditions that have changed since the preoperative exposure, i.e. the 3D reconstruction image that is reconstructed based on the preoperative image data no longer represents the current anatomical or positional conditions. For example, the patient may have gained or lost weight, can lie in a different position on the patient bed, etc. Ambiguities arise therefrom for the attending physician that can make the diagnosis, examination or treatment more difficult, particularly the intervention treatment. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a method and apparatus for the three-dimensional presentation of an examination region of a patient in the form of a 3D reconstruction image, wherein the aforementioned disadvantages are alleviated. This object is achieved in accordance with the invention in a method and apparatus wherein a preoperatively acquired 3D image dataset of the examination region is employed in a medical procedure, 2D datasets of a number of 2D ultrasound images of the examination region are acquired, the preoperative 3D image dataset is updated using the datasets of the 2D ultrasound images, and a 3D reconstruction image is generated on the basis of the updated 3D image dataset. Thus in accordance with the invention the preoperative 3D image dataset is updated at the time of the procedure (examination or treatment or intervention), so that the 3D reconstruction image subsequently reconstructed on the basis of the updated 3D image dataset reproduces the actual anatomical or positional situation. A number of 2D ultrasound images of the examination region are acquired for this purpose. These show the examination region in its current position. The 2D ultrasound images form the basis for the updating. The ultrasound image acquisition is advantageous from a number of points of view. First, it can ensue without great apparatus outlay; second, no radiation stressing of the patient whatsoever occurs due to the ultrasound acquisition. The images also can be acquired very quickly in the context of the ongoing examination or treatment or intervention, so that an excessively longer time for the overall procedure does not occur. The preoperative 3D image dataset can have been acquired with an arbitrary acquisition modality; it can, thus, be a CT dataset or an MR dataset or a 3D X-ray angiography dataset. All of these datasets allow an exact reconstruction of the examination region. These different datasets also can be updated using image data acquired with a different examination modality, namely an ultrasound device. In a first embodiment of the invention, the updating of the preoperative 3D image dataset ensues directly on the basis of the 2D ultrasound images. In an alternative version a 3D ultrasound image dataset is reconstructed on the basis of the 2D ultrasound images, and the updating ensues on the basis of this 3D ultrasound image dataset. A combined updating mode is also possible, i.e. the updating can ensue both on the basis of the 2D ultrasound images as well as on the basis of the reconstructed 3D ultrasound image dataset. When, for example, the updating ensues on the basis of a 3D ultrasound image dataset, then the 3D image dataset and the 3D ultrasound image dataset can be overlaid on one another in accordance with the invention, and those dataset parts of the 3D image dataset that do not adequately agree with the corresponding parts of the 3D ultrasound image dataset are deformed by translation and/or rotation until an adequate superimposition has been achieved. A conforming technique known as “deformable matching” between the preoperative 3D image dataset and the reconstructed 3D ultrasound image dataset is used. A registration is undertaken that deforms the preoperatively acquired image dataset such that it matches the current image dataset better, which should ensue in as short a time as possible in order to keep the waiting time for the patient as short as possible. For this reason, a rigid matching first ensues between the preoperative 3D image dataset and the quasi intraoperatively acquired 3D ultrasound image dataset (the ultrasound volume). No further registration, i.e. modification or deformation of the dataset, is required in the regions wherein the datasets agree well. Only those regions are reconsidered wherein the datasets do not yet coincide to an adequate extent. The two datasets, thus, are subdivided and every inadequately registered region is registered again. To this end, for example, it is possible to produce a 3D reconstruction image and a 3D ultrasound reconstruction image from each dataset and to subdivide the respective, reconstructed volumes into individual voxels of the same size and to then separately compare these voxels to one another. Only those voxels that are not adequately registered relative to one another, i.e. that do not coincide well enough, are registered again. When an adequate registration has been found for each sub-region of the two datasets, these registrations must still be linked to or operated with one another. As a result of this linkage or operation, it is possible that overlaps or gaps may arise. In order to compensate these, in accordance with the invention the overlap or gap regions within the 3D image dataset generated due to the translational and/or rotational deformation are smoothed by interpolation. The time required for the registration can be considerably shortened since a deformation occurs only once at the end given such a registration process and the sub-regions of the datasets are otherwise only rigidly registered. The determination of the deformation parameters required for the updating of a voxel ensues, for example, by means of a grayscale analysis of the data parts or voxels to be compared. The arrangement relative to one another of the image parts to be compared can be recognized from this grayscale distribution analysis. The actual modification of the image dataset, i.e. the actual updating or deformation, thus ensues when the deformation parameters have been found. For the updating given direct employment of the 2D ultrasound images, in accordance with the invention, the 2D ultrasound images are acquired with an ultrasound exposure device having a position sensor that supplies information about the spatial orientation and position of the acquired 2D ultrasound image, this ultrasound image being registered with respect to the coordinates of the 3D image dataset, so that the spatial position and orientation of the acquired 2D ultrasound image relative to the 3D image dataset is known. The acquired 2D ultrasound image is mixed with exact position and orientation into a corresponding sectional plane image of the 3D image dataset, which is subsequently deformed corresponding to the 2D ultrasound image. Thus the 2D ultrasound images are directly employed for the updating. The aforementioned position sensor can be integrated into the ultrasound head or applicator. The position and orientation of the position sensor are identified via a suitable position acquisition system in a coordinate system associated with the position acquisition system. This coordinate system and thus the position sensor, is registered (brought into registration with) with the coordinates of the preoperative 3D image dataset, so that the position and orientation of every 2D ultrasound image acquired during the image acquisition is known relative to the preoperative 3D image dataset. The current 2D ultrasound image can be mixed in the preoperative 3D image dataset at the appropriate position with the position and orientation obtained by the position sensor, i.e. it is mixed with exact position and orientation into the corresponding sectional plane image of the 3D image dataset. For the registration and thus updating of the 3D image dataset, a deformation and matching of the 3D image dataset now ensues by deforming the displayed surfaces and contours of the sectional plane image of the 3D image dataset until they correspond to the anatomy shown in the 2D ultrasound image that has been mixed in, i.e., surfaces or geometrical structures are matched. An improvement of the registration can be achieved by segmenting a surface of the examination region, for example the heart surface, shown in the 3D image dataset before the mixing, and the 2D ultrasound image dataset is subsequently mixed in. As a result of the segmenting, a three-dimensional envelope figure is obtained that shows the surface of the examination region, for example of the heart. By this means, the 2D ultrasound image is subsequently placed with exact orientation and planarity, and the direction in which the 3D surface envelope is to be deformed so that it matches the illustrated 2D contour of the heart in the respective image plane is subsequently determined for defining the deformation parameters. How the deformation should appear for a surface fit is calculated for the determination of the deformation parameters. The actual updating or deformation of the preoperative 3D image dataset subsequently ensues using the deformation parameters. By means of the clear demarcation of the heart surface in the ultrasound image, it is thus possible to determine the spacing and the direction of the same surface in the ultrasound image from the surface in the preoperatively acquired 3D image dataset and, based thereon, to define or modify the deformation parameters in a suitable way. If the examination region is a rhythmically or arrhythmically moving region, for example the heart, then for an exact presentation the image data from the 3D image dataset to be updated and the acquired 2D ultrasound images must each show the examination region in the same motion phase. In order to enable this, in accordance with the invention the motion phase of a rhythmically or arrhythmically moving examination region is acquired, and only image data from the 3D image dataset that are acquired in the same motion phase as the 2D ultrasound images are employed for the 3D reconstruction. The acquisition of the motion phase is required in the acquisition of the 3D image dataset as well as in the 2D ultrasound image acquisition in order to be able to produce isophase images or volumes. The image data to be updated and thus the reconstruction volume, are expediently based on the phase in which the 2D ultrasound images are acquired. It can also be expedient when, in addition to the motion phase, the respective points in time of the acquisition of the 2D ultrasound images is acquired, and only image data from the 3D image dataset that are also acquired at the same points in time as the 2D ultrasound images are employed for the updating and reconstruction of the 3D reconstruction image. When the examination is the heart, then an ECG is expediently recorded for acquiring the motion phase and, if used, the time, the acquisition of the 2D ultrasound images being triggered dependent thereon. An ECG likewise is allocated to the image data for the production of the 3D reconstruction image when they are acquired. The 2D ultrasound images can be acquired extra-corporeally using a known ultrasound exposure device externally applied to the patient. An intracorporeal ultrasound image acquisition is also possible, using a suitable medical instrument, for example in the form of a catheter with an ultrasound exposure head integrated at its tip. On the basis of the updated 3D image dataset, it is now possible to produce a 3D reconstruction image corresponding to the current anatomical situation. As described, this can be employed for diagnostic purposes; however, it is also possible to use this in the context of an intervention. To this end, for example, the ultrasound images are acquired using an instrument that already has been introduced into the examination region in the context of the interventional procedure, for example a catheter introduced into the heart, and the position of the instrument is determined on the basis of at least one 2D ultrasound image and is displayed in the current 3D reconstruction image. This affords the possibility of online visualization of the catheter with exact position and orientation in the updated 3D reconstruction image. To this end, the 2D ultrasound images that show the catheter can be employed. As an alternative, there is the possibility, for example, of employing and mixing in 2D fluoroscopic images that are acquired with a suitable X-ray device. In this case, a 2D/3D registration or a 2D/3D fusion of the 2D real-time images that show the image of the instrument with the updated, preoperative 3D image dataset must be implemented. When, alternatively, a position sensor is integrated in the catheter, positions and orientation of the instrument can be continuously acquired during the intervention with the assistance of this position sensor and can be mixed into the updated preoperative 3D image dataset. A 3D/3D registration of the coordinates of the position sensor with the coordinates of the updated 3D image dataset is assumed for this purpose. The registration can ensue on the basis of any known 2D/3D or 3D/3D registration methods. Such registration modes are well known to those skilled in the art so a more detailed description is not required.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to a therapeutic device and method of administering precisely measured doses of a therapeutic substance via inhalation to pediatric and adult patients. More specifically, the invention relates to a therapeutic device and method of administering inhaled medication which delivers a controlled flow rate to a mouthpiece for administration of medicament to young children, the elderly and other adults with a diminished capacity. 2. Description of Related Art There is a need for an accurate mechanism for delivering precise drug dosages of inhalable medicaments into the lungs of persons with reduced lung capacity. It is standard medical procedure to treat humans afflicted with pulmonary conditions by administering medicament inhalable into the lungs. For example, asthma is a condition characterized by symptoms wherein the airways of the lungs become narrowed, inflamed and filled with mucous such that the patient experiences wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath. Examples of inhalable medicaments used in the treatment of asthma include bronchodilators and anti-inflammatories such as corticosteroids. Other types of inhalable medicaments for different medical conditions include insulin, proteins and polypeptides, enzymes, anticholinergics, antibiotics, antifungals, antivirals, beta-2 agonists, mucolytics and others. One of skill in the art understands that it is important to control the flow rate of an inhaled medicament so that a defined, consistent, metered (i.e., quantifiable) dose may be administered to the patient. Presently, one of the most popular delivery devices is the pressurized propellant driven metered dose inhaler (“pMDI”) which is typically comprised of a canister containing a mixture of propellants, surfactants, preservatives and one or more active pharmaceutical compounds. The pMDI releases a metered dose of aerosolized medicine upon each actuation. (The contents of the canister of the pMDI and/or the pharmaceutical compounds with or without carriers or excipients are examples of what are sometimes referred to herein as “medicament” or “medicaments.”) When used frequently, however, pMDIs have certain drawbacks, such as they tend not to permit the administration of defined dosages of the medicament substance for a variety of reasons. Accessories have been developed in an attempt to overcome these drawbacks. Devices called spacers are often used as accessories with pMDIs for the purpose of providing a contained space or holding chamber between the mouth of the patient and the pMDI nozzle from which the medicament is dispensed. Spacers typically are hollow cylinders with open ends. The spacer or holding chamber is used by placing it in the mouth and the patient pursing his or her lips around it, so that a relatively airtight seal is formed between the mouth and the mouthpiece/nozzle of the holding chamber device or spacer. Once such a seal is formed, the pMDI is actuated, releasing aerosolized medicament into the spacer or holding chamber device from which the patient inhales the medicament. Spacers help to capture the gas emitted from a pMDI but do not facilitate inspiration after actuation of the pMDI. It should be noted that pMDIs may be used without a spacer or holding chamber by actuating the pMDI about 2 inches in front of the mouth of the patient, who inhales the aerosol emitted by the pMDI. An improvement on the spacer device discussed above is a valved holding chamber device, which is similar to a spacer but contains a one-way, low-resistance valve that allows the vaporized or atomized medicament to remain within the body of the chamber until the patient inhales, resulting in the valve opening and permitting the medicament to enter the lungs. Both spacers and holding chambers have the disadvantage that it is very difficult to ensure that the patient has inhaled the correct dosage of the medicament. Reasons for this include, but are not limited to, the tendency of the medicament to settle via gravity out of the aerosol “mist” to the bottom of the spacer or holding chamber. This settling negatively affects the overall amount of medicament available to inhale, as well as the proportion of “respirable particle size” available to inhale. Respirable particle size refers to the ideal size of inhalable particles: the ideal size is in the range of approximately 1.5 to 2.5 microns. Another disadvantage of the spacers and holding chambers is the patient tends to have difficulties properly timing the release of medicament into the spacer or holding chamber so that the patient inhales at the proper moment. The aforementioned deficiencies in administering desired dosages of an inhalable medicament led to the inventor&#39;s improved holding chamber device disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,085,742 (“the &#39;742 Patent), the disclosure of which is incorporated herein in its entirety by reference. The &#39;742 Patent discloses an intrapulmonary device providing a means for controlling the flow rate so that the inhaled medicament is administered and taken into the patient&#39;s lungs in a manner which greatly reduces or even eliminates overdosing and underdosing. When inhalation devices, including the holding chamber disclosed in the &#39;742 Patent, are used by children, or adults with reduced lung capacity, the accuracy of reported doses and/or amount of drug used in the treatment of a pulmonary disease is unreliable. An overdose or an underdose can have undesirable effects on the patient. A patient can have adverse reactions if too large a dosage of the medicament is inhaled. Conversely, if the patient does not inhale the entire dosage, the medicament may be partially or entirely ineffective to treat the condition for which it was administered. The device of the &#39;742 Patent, while easy to use and efficient for the administration of medicaments to adults and older children is less reliable when used with children younger than about six years of age. Given that at present about 60% of asthma patients are between the ages of one and five, there is a significant need for a device which will overcome the aforementioned drawbacks of the prior art. A device which can be readily used on patients as young as two years old, or even younger, as well as adults with significantly diminished lung capacity is highly desirable. It is also highly desirable to have an improved device for readily administering intrapulmonary medicaments to pediatric patients and adults with a diminished capacity for inhaling who are unable to effectively use a pMDI. Intrapulmonary medication delivery to young children has been attempted by physicians, nurses, respiratory technicians, and other clinicians using many different devices, such as nebulizers, holding chambers, spacers, pMDIs, and dry powdered inhalers (“DPIs”). Currently, the accepted method of delivery using pMDls for young children of ages five years or less, or to the elderly or others having reduced ability to create sufficient inspiratory flow to use an MDI or pMDI, is to use a spacer device or holding chamber device along with a facemask. Masks usually come in different sizes to accommodate the different ages and/or sizes of patients&#39; faces. One of the main difficulties in correctly administering inhaled medication results from the inability of some patients to generate consistently low inspiratory flow rates. Most patients inhale at very high inspiratory flow rates in an effort to inhale their entire medicament; this results in a turbulent flow pattern rather than a more desirable laminar flow pattern which provides the best administration of the medicament. Inhaling at a low inspiratory flow rate (30 L/min or less) is equivalent to normal tidal breathing (tidal breathing is a term which describes inhaling and exhaling through the same opening). Many studies in children and especially in children with compromised lung conditions, e.g., Cystic Fibrosis, asthma or other chronic lung diseases (“CLDs”), indicate that low inspiratory flow rates aid in the desirable deep penetration of medication into the pulmonary cavities of the lungs. Moreover, the proper timing of actuating and inhaling medication from a pMDI is difficult to master for very young children and the elderly. Although spacers and holding chambers are helpful, they do not necessarily result in correct flow rates. In an effort to encourage patients to inhale at correct flow rates, most spacers and holding chambers are equipped with so-called coaching whistles, which actuate at high flow rates to provide an audible signal to the adult or pediatric patient that the flow rate is too high, reminding them to slow down their inspiration. Unfortunately, many children like to hear the whistle, and so intentionally breathe in at a high rate to cause the whistle to sound, thus defeating the purpose of the coaching whistle. These whistle mechanisms are also often used in conjunction with masks and in pMDIs. Masks, while quite useful, have additional drawbacks. In order for masks with accessory devices to properly work, the masks must have a tight fit on the patient&#39;s face. This is not always accomplished with the different masks that are currently on the market. Articles have been published claiming that only extremely tight masks, will have a tight enough fit to get medication into the lungs. Masks that leak cause significant problems. Leaked medication decreases effectiveness of the administration of the medication to the patient, and may cause eye irritation as well as resulting in spillage and wasting of medication. Another disadvantage of using a mask is dead space, which is defined as the amount of air that fills the facemask when the mask is placed on the patient&#39;s face. Facemask dead space has been measured as being 20-100 mL in volume. The higher the dead space volume, the less medicament reaches the lungs of the patient. Still another problem with the use of masks is that children tend to find the masks uncomfortable and/or frightening to wear, and therefore do not like having them placed over their mouths and noses. When a mask is used, children tend to have the sensation that they are being smothered, and often resist placement and/or maintenance of the mask on their face. Still yet another problem with masks is that crying inhibits the child&#39;s ability to inhale. In fact, multiple studies have shown that crying infants and toddlers cannot properly inhale medication, leading to insufficient deposition of medication into the lungs. In spite of the aforementioned drawbacks, masks have been used with nebulizers for at least thirty years. Nebulizers are simple mechanical devices which disperse liquid and/or dry medications into fine particulates which may be inhaled. Nebulizers can be air driven, ultrasonically powered or use vibrating membranes. Although all nebulizers can deliver a superior fine particle dose (as compared to pMDIs) to the mask or traditional mouthpiece of an inhaler, they cannot assure improved penetration to the lungs if a child refuses treatment, cries, or the mask leaks.",

    "abstract": "The current invention is a method and device for measuring both penile tumescence and rigidity in a passive manner. In a first embodiment of the device, two elastic bands of differing elasticity, or two fluid-filled tubes of differing elasticity, are placed adjacently to each other on the shaft of the penis and serve as sensors of penile circumference. Changes in circumference of the sensors are monitored by measuring changes in electrical resistance across an electrically conductive material contained within the sensors. A standard computer processor analyzes the sensor output, using changes in sensor circumference to describe penile tumescence, and a comparison of the instantaneous circumferences of the two sensors to describe penile rigidity. In a second embodiment of the current invention, a single sensor (being either a conductive elastic band or a conductive fluid-filled tube, as used in the first embodiment of the invention) is placed around the shaft of the penis and senses a plethysmographic signal. A standard computer processor analyzes the acquired plethysmographic signal, using changes in mean signal intensity to describe penile tumescence, and changes in signal amplitude relative to changes in tumescence to describe penile rigidity. In a third embodiment of the current invention a single reflective photoplethysmographic sensor is placed around the shaft of the penis and senses a plethysmographic signal. A standard computer processor analyzes the acquired plethysmographic signal, using changes in mean signal intensity to describe penile tumescence, and changes in signal amplitude relative to changes in tumescence to describe penile rigidity It will be understood that combinations of these three, embodiments are possible, using, for example, an elastic band sensor to measure tumescence by means of changes in sensor circumference, and a photoplethysmographic sensor to measure rigidity at the same time. In all embodiments, the small and lightweight sensors are the only components of the device that come into contact with the patient. The sensors are connected to a resistance-measuring device and a small data-logger such as the A-ENGINE-P (TERN INC., Davis, Calif., USA). The data is downloaded to a computer processor either directly by cable, or via telemetry. When the sensor is a photoplethysmograph, however, the sensor output does not pass through a resistance-measuring device. Rather, the sensor output is directly input to an electronic circuit that generates a signal that is proportional to the amplitude of the pulse detected by the photoplethysmograph (amplitude demodulation). According to the teachings of the present invention there is provided a method for measuring the rigidity of a penis, including positioning a first circular sensor and a second circular sensor around the penis, the first and second circular sensors each being of different viscoelasticity to each other; measuring a circumference of the first circular sensor and a circumference of the second circular sensor; and calculating a comparator of the measured circumferences of the first and second circular sensors. There is further provided a method for measuring erectile function of a penis, including sensing a plethysmographic signal from the penis, the plethysmographic signal depicting pulsatory changes in the penile volume over time; and measuring a mean intensity of the sensed plethysmographic signal. There is. further provided a system for measuring rigidity of a penis, including a first circular sensor, operative to increase in diameter in response to an increase in diameter of the penis; a second circular sensor, operative to increase in diameter in response to an increase in diameter of the penis, the second circular sensor being of different viscoelasticity to the first circular sensor; a mechanism for measuring a circumference of each of the circular sensors; and a processor for calculating a comparator of the measured circumferences of each of the circular sensors. There is further provided a system for measuring erectile function of a penis, including a plethysmographic sensor, operable to sense a plethysmographic signal from the penis; and a processor, operable to process the sensed plethysmographic signal so as to describe a change in mean signal intensity.",

    "full_text": "BACKGROUND \n     In preparing meat products for consumption, the animal supplying the meat products needs to be put down. This is typically done by first stunning the animal and then bleeding the animal out. Electrical and carbon dioxide stunning systems are the two main systems used today for stunning pigs. Both of these systems have their advantages and disadvantages when compared to one another. Electrical stunning is very quick if applied correctly. Regarding its use on pigs, it places the pigs into a state of unconsciousness. In particular, into a grand mal seizure. Moreover, depending on how the electrodes are placed, it can also put the pig into cardiac arrest. After electrical stunning has been applied to the pig, the pig can be bled out and very quickly rendered dead. The cost is comparatively low from a capital cost standpoint as well as on an ongoing cost basis when compared to carbon dioxide.

The invention relates also to apparatus comprising a blood analysis part for receiving a blood sample. Diabetes sufferers may be provided with quantities of insulin, for instance by injection, sometimes a number of times daily. The quantity of insulin that is appropriate depends on the person&#39;s blood glucose level, so blood glucose level measurement can also occur a number of times daily. Blood glucose level measurement typically is a multi stage process. The first is lancing, in which a lancet, or needle, is used to pierce the skin of a user, for example on the end or side of a finger. Once a suitable amount of blood has been produced, a sample is taken on a testing strip. A person may need to squeeze their finger in order to cause sufficient blood to be expelled. Sometimes lancing needs to be reperformed. The testing strip then is provided to a meter, typically an electronic meter, which analyses the sample, for example by determining a parameter (e.g. an electrochemical potential or voltage, resulting from a chemical reaction between the blood sample and an enzyme present in the testing strip, and provides a blood glucose measurement result. This measurement is then used to determine an amount of insulin to be consumed by the person. Lancing can be painful or at least uncomfortable for a user. Numerous efforts have been made to reduce or minimise discomfort to a user in the lancing process. More effective efforts typically involve more complicated, and thus more expensive, mechanical or electro-mechanical arrangements.",

    "abstract": "The invention relates to improvements in the filed of ballet skis. The improvements relate to improved stability at low speeds, lighter weight, easier manufacturing, enhanced safety and easier transportation. 2. Description of the Prior Art The typical prior art snow ski is very long, narrow and thin. These skis typically exhibit some flexibility along their length, but assume a reversed camber in their unflexed condition. Thus, a ski that has its bottom placed on a flat surface will be supported by the front and rear of the ski. However, portions of the ski between the front and rear will be spaced upwardly from the flat supporting surface. Bindings are used to releasably secure ski boots to the skis. The bindings include a pressure sensitive release that will separate the boot from the ski in response to forces encountered during a fall. The release of the ski substantially reduces the possibility of leg or knee injuries. Most prior art bindings include brakes that bite into the snow when the boot is released from binding. The brakes are located adjacent the top surface of the ski and generally behind the heal of the ski boot when the ski boot is locked into the binding. Upon release of the ski boot from the binding, the brakes move laterally beyond the sides of the ski and pivot downwardly into the snow. The length of prior art skis make them difficult to carry. Some skiers use the brakes to clamp the skis in bottom-to-bottom relationship. The interconnected skis can then be held in one hand while the skier carries additional equipment in the other hand. This interlocking of brakes can be difficult to achieve and difficult to maintain. Even a slight shifting of one ski relative to the other can cause the brakes to disengage and can make the carrying of skis cumbersome. The prior art also includes ski carriers in the form of plastic clamps that lockingly engage around a pair of skis. The clamps include a carrying handle and can greatly facilitate the carrying of prior art skis. However, the carrier must be stored while the skis are being used. Furthermore, the carrier does not avoid the inconveniences attributed to the considerable length of most prior art skis. The prior art also includes elongate flexible straps with metallic rings affixed to each end. Opposed ends of the strap can be looped through the rings, and the loops can be tightened around spaced apart locations on a pair of skis. The strap and skis then can be carried by hand or draped over the shoulder of the skier. These prior art straps are desirable in that they are inexpensive and can readily be collapsed and stored in the pocket while the skis are being used. However, the straps are not stable on the skis and the loops will eventually slide toward a central location near the bindings. Skiers have difficulty balancing the unstably suspended skis. Very effective prior art skis are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,705,291 and in U.S. Design Pat. No. Des. 339,398 both of which issued to Richard Gauer. The skis shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,705,291 and in U.S. Design Pat. No. Des. 339,398 are shorter, wider and thicker than the conventional prior art ski described above, and are substantially inflexible. The bottom surface of the skis shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,705,291 and in U.S. Design Pat. No. Des. 339,398 are continuously arcuately convex from front to rear. The ski shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,705,291 also is arcuately convex in a side-to-side direction at all locations along a centrally disposed, longitudinally extending strip of the bottom surface. However the sides of the bottom surface shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,705,291 are substantially flat in a side-to-side direction and opposed sides are generally colinear with one another at any cross-section. The ski shown in U.S. Design Pat. No. Des. 339,398 does not include this side-to-side flattening near the side edges, and is continuously arcuately convex from side to side at all locations along the ski. The degree of side-to-side convexity in both of these patented skis varies along the length of the ski, such that a greater curvature exists at locations forward and aft of the foot. The skis shown in patents to Richard Gauer achieve the seemingly inconsistent objectives of providing enhanced mobility and increased control while performing various downhill ballet skiing maneuvers. These skis have enabled experienced skiers to perform beautiful artistic ballet movements while skiing down a steep slope, and also have enabled novice skiers, elderly skiers and handicapped skiers to effortlessly perform basic downhill skiing maneuvers. The skis shown in the patents to Richard Gauer are marketed under the trademark GAUER. Despite the many advantages of the skies shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,705,291 and U.S. Design Pat. No. Des. 339,398, improvements can still be made. For example, the side-to-side convexity at all locations along the length of the GAUER brand of ski can make skiers feel unstable when skiing slowly on packed snow or when standing stationary on packed snow. This may occur, for example, when the skier is moving into or through a ski lift line or when a skier is exiting a chair lift. At these locations, the snow is likely to be densely packed, and the skier may be standing substantially erect with weight balanced centrally over the skis while moving very slowly or standing still. Under these conditions, a novice skier may perceive a loss of balance in response to a shift of weight. The prior art GAUER brand skis also are considered to be heavy for their size. In this regard, the hollow foam-filled embodiments formed from two lateral channels as depicted in U.S. Pat. No. 4,705,291 have been difficult to commercialize. Rather, the unitary injection molded ski depicted in the design patent has proved more commercially feasible. However, in view of the significant thickness, the unitarily molded ski is fairly heavy (3.5 pounds each ski without bindings) and requires a fairly long injection molding cycle time. The width and thicknesses of the GAUER brand of skis also have made use prior art brakes difficult. In particular, prior art brakes will rotate into the top surface of the GAUER brand ski before moving laterally beyond the sides of the ski. Attempts have been made to bend the brakes outwardly into positions that will permit them to rotate fully. However, these revisions to the prior art brakes cause the brakes to project laterally even while the boots are in the bindings. Thus, a skier can readily catch one boot or ski on the inside brake of the opposed ski. Furthermore, the outwardly bent brakes do not dig deeply into the snow, and hence braking effectiveness is reduced. The shorter length of the GAUER brand of skis intuitively should lead to easier carrying. However, the greater width and thickness makes it difficult to manually grasp these skis. Additionally, the prior art plastic carrying clamps are not dimensionally suited to the prior art GAUER brand of skis. The prior art straps described above can be used with GAUER brand of skis. However, these prior art straps have certain deficiencies as noted above. Additionally, the significant width and thickness dimensions of GAUER brand of skis make the looping required by the prior art straps even more difficult. Furthermore, these skis inherently leave little room aft of the bindings. Hence, there is only a very short space on the prior art GAUER brand skis that can be engaged by the loop of the prior art strap. Water skis bear some resemblance to snow skis, but are subject to significantly different forces during use. Nevertheless, the water ski shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,134,992 has a bottom surface which, at all locations along the ski is curved from front to rear and flat from side-to-side. The ski also includes plane surfaces around the bottom periphery to define a dihedral at the intersections with the flat bottom surface. The continuous front to rear curvature would not yield enhanced stability for a stationary or slow moving skier on snow. Furthermore, the bottom surface that is flat from side-to-side at all locations and the plane surfaces around the bottom periphery would not permit smooth flowing ballet movement on snow. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The subject invention is directed to an improved ballet ski. The ski is substantially rigid and includes opposed front and rear ends, a top surface, a bottom surface and a pair of longitudinally extending sides. The ski preferably is formed from plastic material. However, metallic edges are securely affixed to the bottom surface of the ski adjacent the respective sides. The bottom surface of the ski is characterized by a substantially planar region that is approximately symmetrical with the pivot point. The pivot point is the location on the top surface of the ski about which the bindings are centered. The planar region on the bottom surface preferably is generally elliptical in shape, and may have a major axis aligned with the longitudinal axis of the ski. The planar region on the bottom surface of the ski preferably extends longitudinally a distance less than the length of the typical ski boot used with the ski. A preferred length for the planar region is approximately 6-10 inches. Regions of the bottom surface forwardly and rearwardly of the planar region are continuously arcuately convex from front to rear to achieve effective and efficient maneuverability with the ski. The planar region on the bottom surface of the ski further includes a width extending transverse to the longitudinal axis of the ski. The width of the planar region is less than the width of the ski. Portions of the bottom surface on either side of the planar region are convex from side-to-side. Furthermore, these portions of the bottom surface on either side of the planar region are continuously arcuately convex from front to rear. Portions of the bottom surface forwardly and rearwardly of the planar region are continuously convex from side to side. The degree of side-to-side convexity is greatest at locations on the bottom surface forward of the planar region. The symmetrically disposed planar region on the bottom surface of the ski achieves stability when a skied is standing still or moving slowly, and is particularly effective on densely packed snow. Thus, the planar region contributes to a sense of security when a skier is stopped in a ski lift line, when the skier makes an initial movement from a stopped position in a ski lift line, or when the skier is performing slow basic skiing movements. This slow skiing may be carried out when the skier is on the densely packed snow at the bottom of the slope or when the skier has exited a chair lift and is approaching the start of a downhill slope. However, the side-to-side convexity that exists between the planar region and the side edges of the ski ensures that the skier has superior maneuverability during normal skiing. Furthermore, the side-to-side convexity covers a longer distance at both the forward and rearward ends of the planar surface. The greater width of the side-to-side convex region at the forward end of the planar area enables the skier to roll the bottom surface of the skis efficiently into a turn, while the comparably greater width of the side-to-side convex region at the rear end of the planar area enables the skier to efficiently roll the bottom surface of the ski out of a turn. Throughout all such turns, the metallic side edges of each ski are effective in gripping snow or ice to provide exceptional control. Thus, the unique bottom surface of the ski ensures stability when the skier is stationary or moving slowly and provides controllable maneuverability at all other times. The ski may be formed from interconnected top and bottom components. The top and bottom components may respectively include longitudinally extending interfitting ribs to achieve proper and permanent alignment between the top and bottom components and to ensure adequate rigidity in all directions. The ribs on the top and/or bottom component may be dimensioned to leave a plurality of longitudinally extending air chambers for reducing the weight of each ski. However, the ribs preferably are disposed and dimensioned to ensure an adequate amount of plastic for anchoring the metallic edges of the ski and for mounting the bindings. The top and bottom components of each ski may be mechanically interconnected with one another. However, a preferred interconnection employs sonic welding to integrally attach the top and bottom components to one another at selected locations where the top and bottom components contact. The ski may include locally chamfered regions at the interface of the top surface and the sides to accommodate movement of brakes on the bindings. The chamfers permit the brakes to pivot downwardly as they are translating laterally and into a braking disposition. Similarly, the chamfers permit the brakes to efficiently rotate upwardly and to translate inwardly as the boot is being engaged into the bindings. These chamfers avoid the need to deform the brakes, and hence ensure that the brakes are positioned to avoid contact with the opposing ski or boot during normal skiing. Each ski preferably includes a transversely aligned slot extending entirely therethrough at a location near the extreme rear end of the ski. The skis may further be used in conjunction with a strap having hooks attached to opposed ends. The hooks are releasably engageable in the slots of the skis to permit convenient carrying of the skis.",

    "abstract": "To permit the greatest utilization in a variety of scanners, including dual CT/PET scanners, and CT, MRI or optical scanners used in conjunction with PET and/or SPECT scanners, a single sealed radioactive source designed to be used as a calibration or reference source for medical imaging detectors such as gamma cameras, SPECT, CT, MRI, PET and optical scanners is provided. Briefly, one embodiment of the invention comprises a multimodal source for imaging with at least one of a gamma camera, a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner and a single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT)scanner, and at least one of a computed tomography (CT) scanner, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner, and optical scanner. The multimodal source comprises radioactive material and at least one material that is a target for at least one of CT scanning, MRI scanning and optical scanning. For CT scanning, a “target material” or “target substance” has a mass density greater than about 1 g/cc so as to be visible against a water or water equivalent background but having an upper mass density that is specific to the X-ray energy of the CT scanner so as not to leave artifacts. Artifacts interfere with image quality and it is therefore desirable to eliminate them in images. For example, for a scanner using 50 kVp X-rays, the upper limit of the mass density greater than about 2 g/cc would leave artifacts in the image. For scanners using up to 120 kVp X-rays, the upper limit of the mass density is about 3 to 3.5 g/cc. For MRI scanners, the “target material” or “target substance” is a paramagnetic material. For optical scanners, a “target material” or “target substance” is scintillation material along with a material to activate the scintillation material. The source comprises a solid or sealed radioactive component utilizing one or more radionuclide, which can include Ag-110m, Am-241, Au-195, Ba-133, C-14, Cd-109, Ce-139, Co-57, Co-60, Cs-137, Eu-152, Gd-151, Gd-153, Ge-68, Hg-203, Ir-192, I-125, I-129, I-131, Lu-173, Lu-177m, Mn-54, Na-22, Ra-226, Rh-101, Ru-103, Ru-106, Sb-125, Se-75, Sn-113, Sr-90, Ta-182, Te-123m, Tl-204, Th-228, Th-229, Th-230, Y-88, Zn-65, and Zr-95, with Ba-133, Co-57, Ge-68, Na-22, Gd-153, Cs-137 and Se-75 being particularly good nuclides to provide for PET and SPECT visibility and one or more of the following: barium or iodine salts (as well as other known compounds that are targets for CT scans such as bone-equivalent density material such as alumina ceramic or high density plastic, polymers or glass) to provide a target for CT scanners; and gadolinium salts and other paramagnetic MRI imaging substances to provide MRI targets and scintillator materials to provide optical targets. The source can have any of numerous shapes, including but not limited to a point, a ring, a line, a plane, a cylinder, a box, and anthropomorphic shapes such as heart, breast, torso, brain, or thyroid mimics. The radioactive and CT-, MRI- and/or optical target materials may be localized in certain regions of the source and/or distributed throughout the source and can be presented in a matrix of material. The radioactive and CT-, MRI- and/or optical target materials may also be incorporated into a single element, superimposed in layers or consecutive structures, or placed in separate locations. For three-dimensional phantoms intended for medical imaging (e.g., the cylinder, box, and anthropomorphic configurations, etc.), the matrix material is preferably chosen to be at a water- or tissue-equivalent density. Other densities could be used to meet the needs of other applications. The radionuclide can best be selected from known calibrators for the detector system with which the source is to be used, or can be selected from possible radionuclides that have radiation energies similar to radionuclides used with the detector systems to be used. These radionuclides include, but are not limited to Ag-110m, Am-241, Au-195, Ba-133, C-14, Cd-109, Ce-139, Co-57, Co-60, Cs-137, Eu-152, Gd-151, Gd-153, Ge-68, Hg-203, Ir-192, I-125, I-129, I-131, Lu-173, Lu-177m, Mn-54, Na-22, Ra-226, Rh-101, Ru-103, Ru-106, Sb-125, Se-75, Sn-113, Sr-90, Ta-182, Te-123m, Tl-204, Th-228, Th-229, Th-230, Y-88, Zn-65, and Zr-95, with Ba-133, Co-57, Ge-68, Na-22, Gd-153, Cs-137 and Se-75 being particularly good nuclides to provide for PET and SPECT visibility. The particular radionuclides to be used are preferably chosen based upon factors such as their half-life (which are typically much longer than the half lives of the radionuclides used in imaging humans and animals), their energy peak correlations with radionuclides used in imaging humans and other animals, and an absence of higher energy emissions. The intended use of these multimodal sources is for image coregistration (e.g., when images are taken on two or more machines), quality control, resolution and contrast measurements, and qualitative or quantitative scatter and attenuation measurements for medical imaging detectors. Other uses and configurations may be possible for nonmedical and more general scientific imaging applications.",

    "abstract": "Typical implant systems utilize a rod as the support and stabilizing member. In such an implant, a series of two or more screws are inserted into two or more vertebrae to be instrumented. A rod is then placed within or coupled to the heads of the screws, or is placed within a connecting device that links the rod and a screw head, and the connections are secured. In this way, a supporting structure is fixed to the vertebrae. Many varieties of bone fixation screws are mono-axial in construction. That is, such devices are connected to the rod or plate such that a longitudinal axis through the rod or plate and a longitudinal axis through the fixation device are capable of only a single position with respect to each other. While useful in certain circumstances, in many therapeutic situations the degree of precision required to use such an inflexible device is impractical. More recently, bone fixation devices having multi-axial capability have been introduced. Examples of such constructs are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,797,911, 5,954,725, 5,810,818 and 6,485,491 which is hereby incorporated by reference. These devices help to reduce the required precision of placement of the fixation device, since the saddle portion of the fixation device is multi-axially positionable on the anchor member portion. The saddle portion can thus be positioned so as to easily receive the rod, limiting or removing much of the positioning difficulty inherent in prior devices. Most such devices are designed for spinal fixation at the thoracic and lumbar levels and allow only a limited angulation of the anchor member in relation to the saddle member. There is a need in the art for a multi-axial bone attachment assembly, and particularly one that is useful in the cervical region of the spine with a greater degree of such angulation. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One embodiment of the present invention is a unique multi-axial bone attachment assembly that includes a saddle member and a bone anchoring member. The saddle member has a plurality of upright portions that define a channel through the saddle member. The saddle member further has a hole therethrough bounded by an inner wall, and the hole forms a lower opening in the saddle member. The lower opening in the saddle member may contain angular cutouts placed symmetrically about the axis of the saddle to increase the allowable angulation of the bone screw in relationship to the axis of the saddle. The position, angle and number of cutouts may vary as required by the application of the multi-axial bone attachment assembly. The bone-anchoring member extends through the opening. The bone-anchoring member includes a head portion and an anchoring portion. A further embodiment of the present invention includes a washer (crown member). The washer may have a recessed portion for accommodating an orthopedic rod and may include a radially extending projection.

Some Russian and Japanese publications have proposed the use of polyvinyl alcohol as a gas barrier coating for produce, but few if any of these suggestions have found their way into the commercial market. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,165,529 and 6,203,833 commonly owned by the assignee of this application, disclose highly improved processes for preserving fresh produce and coating compositions therefore comprised of substantially hydrolyzed cold water soluble polyvinyl alcohol, low molecular weight cold water soluble starch, and surfactant.

OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of this invention is to provide a new, improved and highly economical coating process for extending the shelf life of post-harvest produce and a composition therefore. Another object of this invention is to provide a process for preserving post-harvest produce that prolongs the period during which the produce may be stored at ambient temperatures without significant deterioration of the produce. A further object is to provide a process for preserving fresh produce that delays maturation, water loss, and ripening of post-harvest produce and therefore prolongs the duration of time between harvesting and the time in which the produce is in prime condition for consumption. In accordance with the invention, the new and improved process resides in the application to the exterior surface of post-harvest produce of an improved coating composition comprising an aqueous emulsion from about 0.25 to about 25 percent by weight polyvinylidene chloride copolymer, and from about 0.0001 to 10 percent surfactant, preferably Triton-X. Optional additional ingredients include antimicrobrials, plasticizers, and antifoaming agents. The coating composition limits but does not prevent respiratory exchange, i.e., transmission of oxygen (air) into the produce, transmission of gasses, e.g. ethylene and carbon dioxide, out of the produce, and water vapor transmission to control and prolong the maturation and ripening process and, to increase the permissible storage time between harvest and consumption.

    "abstract": "A hot melt pressure sensitive adhesive suitable for use as a positioning adhesives is prepared comprising: 20 to 40% by weight of a styrene-butadiene-styrene block or multi-block copolymer containing 38 to 55 parts styrene per 100 parts copolymer; 30 to 70% by weight of a tackifying resin selected from the group consisting of modified hydrogenated rosins; glycerol and pentaerythritol esters of modified hydrogenated rosins; copolymers and terpolymers of natural terpenes; polyterpene resins having a softening point, as determined by ASTM method E28-58T, of from about 80 to 150° C.; aromatic petroleum hydrocarbon resins and the hydrogenated derivatives thereof; and copolymers of aliphatic and aromatic monomers; 10 to 30% by weight of naphthenic or paraffinic oil; and 0.1 to 2% by weight of an antioxidant; wherein the ratio of oil to copolymer is 1:1 or less. Thus the present invention is directed to absorbent articles comprising an elongated absorbent pad having a body facing surface and a garment facing surface, a portion of the garment facing surface being coated with the hot melt adhesive composition described above. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS The block copolymers used herein are recognized as linear A-B-A triblock copolymers or radial-block copolymers, or as A-B-A-B-A-B multi-block copolymers where the A block is styrene and the B block is butadiene and wherein the copolymer contains 38 to 55 parts styrene per 100 parts copolymer. These copolymers may be prepared using methods taught, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,239,478; 3,427,269; 3,700,633; 3,753,936; and 3,932,327. Alternatively, they may be obtained from Firestone under the tradenames Stereon 840 A and Stereon 845, from Shell under the tradename DX1150 and from Enichem (Italy) under the tradename Sol T162. The tackifying resins useful in these adhesive compositions can be hydrocarbon resins, synthetic polyterpenes, hydrogenated rosin esters, and the like. More particularly, the useful tackifying resins include any compatible resins or mixtures thereof such as (1) glycerol and pentaerythritol esters of modified hydrogenated rosins, such, for example as the glycerol ester of hydrogenated rosin, (2) copolymers and terpolymers of natural terpenes, e.g. styrene/terpene and alpha methyl styrene/terpene; (3) polyterpene resins having a softening point, as determined by ASTM method E28-58T, of from about 80 to 150° C.; the latter polyterpene resins generally resulting from the polymerization of terpene hydrocarbons, such as the bicyclic monoterpene known as pinene, in the presence of Friedel-Crafts catalysts at moderately low temperatures; also included are (4) the hydrogenated polyterpene resins; and (5) copolymers of aliphatic and aromatic monomers such as Wingtack 86 available from Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company. While other known tackifying resins are not useful as the sole tackifier in the composition, it is possible to obtain satisfactory results utilizing a blend of tackifiers where a substantial portion of the blend is comprised of one of the tackifiers represented above. The selection of the particular tackifying agent is, in large part, dependent upon the specific block copolymers employed. Generally the tackifier is present in the hot melt adhesive in an amount of 30-70%, preferably 50 to 60%, by weight. Various plasticizing or extending oils are also present in the composition in amounts of 10% to about 30%, preferably 15 to 20%, by weight in order to provide wetting action and/or viscosity control It is desirable that the amount of oil present in the adhesive not exceed the amount of the block polymer. The usual plasticizing oils such as paraffinic and naphthenic oils are preferred; however, the invention also contemplates the use of the olefin oligomers and low molecular weight polymers as well as vegetable and animal oil and their derivatives. The petroleum derived oils which may be employed are relatively high boiling materials containing only a minor proportion of aromatic hydrocarbons (preferably less than 30% and, more particularly, less than 15% by weight of the oil). Alternatively, the oil may be totally non-aromatic. The oligomers may be polypropylenes, polybutenes, hydrogenated polyisoprene, hydrogenated polybutadiene, or the like having average molecular weights between about 350 and about 10,000. Vegetable and animal oils include glyceryl esters of the usual fatty acids and polymerization products thereof. Additionally, some or all of theoil or some portion of the tackifying resin may be replaced by a liquid tackifying resins such as Wingtack 10 (a low molecular weight liquid aliphatic synethetic polyterpene plasticizing resin). Various petroleum derived waxes may also be used in amounts less than about 15% by weight of the composition in order to impart fluidity in the molten condition of the adhesive and flexibility to the set adhesive, and to serve as a wetting agent. The term &#34;petroleum derived wax&#34; includes both paraffin and microcrystalline waxes having melting points within the range of 54-110° C. as well as synthetic waxes such as low molecular weight polyethylene or Fisher-Tropsch waxes. Among the applicable stabilizers or antioxidants utilized herein are included high molecular weight hindered phenols and multifunctional phenols such as suflur and phosphorous-containing phenols. Hindered phenols are well known to those skilled in the art and may be characterized as phenolic compounds which also contain sterically bulky radicals in close proximity to the phenolic hydroxyl group hereof. In particular, tertiary butyl groups generally substituted onto the benzene ring in at least one of the ortho positions relative to the phenolic hydroxy group. The presence of these sterically bulky substituted radicals in the vicinity of the hydroxyl group serves to retard its stretching frequency and, correspondingly, its reactivity; this steric hindrance thus providing the phenolic compound with its stabilizing properties. Representative hindered phenols include: 1,3,5-trimethyl 2,4,6-tris (3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)benzene; pentaerythrityl tetrakis-3(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate; n-octadecyl-3(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionate; 4,4&#39;methylenebis (2,6-tert-butylphenol); 4,4&#39;-thiobis (6-tert-butyl-o-cresol); 2,6-ditertbutylphenol; 6-(4-hydroxyphenoxy)-2,4-bis-(n-octyl-thio)-1,3,5-triazine; di-n-octadecyl 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-benzylphosphonate; 2-(n-octylthio)ethyl 3,5-di-tert-butyl--4-hydroxy-benzoate; and sorbitol hexa[3-(3-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)-propionate]; zinc di-n-butyl dithiocarbamate and zinc diethyl dithiocarbamate. The performance of these antioxidants may be further enhanced by utilizing, in conjunction therewith known synergists such, for example, as thiodipropionate esters and phosphites, particularly useful is distearylthiodipropionate. These stabilizers are generally present in amounts of about 0.1 to 2 weight percent, preferably 0.25 to 1.0%. In formulating the hot melt adhesives of the present invention, the styrene-butadiene copolymer is used in an amount of 20-40% by weight, preferably 25 to 35%; with 30-70%, preferably 50-60%, of a tackifier; 10-30%, preferably 15-20%, of a plasticizing oil and a small effective amount of an antioxidant. Other additives such as plasticizers, pigments, dystuffs conventionally added to hot melt adhesives for the various end uses contemplated may also be incorporated in minor amounts into the formulations of the present invention. The adhesive compositions are prepared by blending the components in the melt at a temperature of about 130-200° C. until a homogeneous blend is obtained, approximately 2 hours. Various methods of blending are known to the art and any method that produces a homogeneous blend is satisfactory. An exemplary procedure involves placing the block copolymer, antioxidants and a portion of the oil in a jacketed mixing kettle, for example in a jacketed heavy duty mixer of the Baker-Perkins type, which is equipped with rotors and thereupon raising the temperature to a range of from about 120° to 180° C. When the mixture has been masticated to a uniform consistency, the tackifying resin and the remainder of the oil are gradually added in order to avoid the formation of lumps. Mixing and heating are continued until a smooth, homogeneous mass is obtained whereupon the remainder of the tackifying resin and the oil are thoroughly and uniformly admixed therewith. The resultant hot melt adhesives are generally produced in bulk form and packaged in release coated containers. The resulting hot-melt pressure sensitive adhesive, once it is heated to a temperature where it will flow readily, can be applied directly to the outer covering layer of the absorbent structure or article or it may be reverse (transfer) coated onto release paper using any of the techniques known in the art, including flow coating, roller coating, knife coating, or the like. The adhesive can also be extruded into place by using a hot-melt extruder or die face.",

    "abstract": "The present invention pertains to a respiration humidifier with an outer jacket, a water feed, a breathing feed line and a breathing gas drain line. A bundle of hydrophobic hollow fibers made of a material that is permeable to water vapor but is impermeable to water is positioned inside the outer jacket. The breathing gas feed line and breathing gas drain line are in flow connection with the interior of the hollow fibers. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Respiration humidifiers are used to humidify the inspiratory air of respirators to physiological values and to optionally beat it. Such devices, which operate according to various principles, are arranged, in general, separated from the respirator. One drawback of the separate arrangement for the user is the lack of clarity of handling, due, among other things, to the large number of different tubing and connections. If a humidifier is integrated within the respirator, the diversity of accessories and ultimately the overall costs can be reduced for the manufacturer, because a completely equipped respirator is offered. A respiration humidifier of this class has been known from U.S. Pat. No. 3,871,373. One drawback of this respiration humidifier is the relative size as well as the additionally necessary components, such as pumps, feed and drain lines. SUMMARY AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION The object of the present invention is to propose an improved, compact and low-maintenance respiration humidifier of a simple design. The object is accomplished by means of hollow fibers having means for electrical heating on their outer circumferential surface. One essential advantage of the present invention is that due to the compact, modular design, the respiration humidifier according to the present invention can be directly integrated in the inspiratory line of the respirator. Another advantage of the present invention arises from the fact that hygienically objectionable contamination of the breathing air can be avoided due to the closed water system. For feeding in water, a water bag containing sterile water is simply connected, and the static pressure of this bag fills the module according to the present invention with water. For example, an intubation kit commonly employed in hospital practice may be used as the supply line. The water connection to the modular respiration humidifier according to the present invention can be designed such that a bacteria filter is arranged at the inlet, so that microorganisms cannot enter even if the water bag is not connected. The respiration humidifier according to the present invention is designed as follows. A bundle of hollow fibers arranged essentially in parallel, preferably made of one of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyurethane, polysulfone, and porous sinted glass, is located in an outer jacket, e.g., one made of a laminated plastic, the length and the diameter of the fibers being selected to be such that a water vapor-permeable area of about 500 to 800 cm 2  is available in the circumferential area in the case of a corresponding number of fibers. The porous sintered glass can be hydrophobized with silicone. In the case of a fiber diameter of 1 to 2 mm, about 200 fibers with a length of about 65 mm are needed in order not to generate an excessively high flow resistance, and in order to obtain the most compact design possible with the desired humidifying capacity. A suitable flow expansion, which is directly in flow connection with a breathing gas feed line and with a breathing gas drain line into and out of the respiration humidifier, is located in the beginning and end areas of the hollow fibers. The water-filled outer area around the hollow fibers, which is in flow connection with the water reservoir via the water feed of the module, is located around the hollow fibers, and is closed by the outer, laminated jacket. The hollow fibers themselves consist of hydrophobic or hydrophobically coated membranes, preferably ones made of PTFE, which let water through in the form of water vapor, but retain liquid water under the given conditions of use. After the water reservoir has been connected and the volume around the hollow fibers has been filled with water due to the static pressure, the entrapped air can flow out of the respiration humidifier via a separate ventilation, e.g., one made of porous PTFE, unless the hydrophobic hollow fibers exert a sufficient ventilating action themselves. The hollow fibers used make it possible to passively establish a nearly constant humidification of the air fed in the range of 90% to 100% relative humidity over the broad range of flow conditions. This means that the flow of gas is always humidified uniformly in continuous operation and in intermittent operation. It is essential for the present invention that the heater is arranged directly around the hollow fibers in the water bath in the jacket of the respiration humidifier, i.e., it is integrated in the humidifier module. It was found that the heat must be fed in as close as possible to the area in which the evaporation is generated. The evaporation takes place in this case on the inside of the hollow fibers on the gas/air side. The basic objective of the present invention is to operate all hollow fibers at the same temperature in order to obtain an extensively uniform breathing gas temperature and humidity over the entire cross section of the humidifier module. Only this can guarantee an optimal utilization of every individual hollow fiber in terms of the release of humidity and heat. Individual hollow fibers might otherwise be too cold and would have an insufficient humidification capacity, whereas others would be too warm and thus they would lead to excessive humidification capacity, as a result of which the humidity would again precipitate as a condensate. Each hollow fiber of the bundle is directly heated electrically according to the present invention. This can be done in the following ways. Individual resistor wires are wound around the hollow fibers and in the longitudinal direction, or they are printed on or applied as strips or films, and, as an alternative and preferably, the hollow fibers are preferably coated from the outside by vapor deposition with a metal used as a resistor heater, and are provided with corresponding current connections. According to another variant of the preparation, the hollow fibers would be arranged on a heating foil in parallel and next to each other. The strip thus equipped would then be rolled up, so that a hollow fiber bundle with direct heating of at least part of the opposite circumferential surface areas of the hollow fibers is formed. The system is operated in practice such that a temperature range of about 40° C. to 45° C. is not exceeded, so that short-term bursts of hot gas, which are sometimes possible in prior-art humidifier systems, are ruled out. For a precautionary disinfection or sterilization, the entire humidifier module can be briefly heated by the integrated heater to a desired temperature, e.g., to 134° C. for 3 minutes. A temperature sensor may be introduced into the water bath for a desired temperature control. This may also be used at the same time to recognize lack of water and a possible overheating that may occur as a result. A possibly desired heater of the airway tubes with temperature control can be operated independently from the humidifier module. Setting of the desired humidity can be performed with this tube heater, which was also used in the prior art. If, e.g., the temperature is higher at the end of the inspiration tube than at the beginning, the relative humidity is reduced. The setting of the desired breathing gas temperature may also be performed directly from the respirator, and the measured values are indicated there. The control and the supply of the humidifier module with the correctly metered thermal energy may also be provided on the respirator, so that the respiration humidifier according to the present invention can also be integrated in a respirator functionally, not only due to its compact, modular design. The various features of novelty which characterize the invention are pointed out with particularity in the claims annexed to and forming a part of this disclosure. For a better understanding of the invention, its operating advantages and specific objects attained by its uses, reference is made to the accompanying drawings and descriptive matter in which preferred embodiments of the invention are illustrated.",

Included among these approaches is the use of a ventilated mattress in which an airflow is created through the mattress to dissipate carbon dioxide accumulation adjacent the infant&#39;s nose and mouth. \n     It is believed that ventilated mattresses, as well as other ventilated furniture such as chairs, sofas, loveseats, etc., would have benefits for individuals other than infants, inclu...",

    "abstract": "The present-invention relates to improved putters with heightened center-of-gravity. BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY An important part of golfing is putting. Accurate putting requires attention to speed/distance and line. Speed/distance is controlled by the velocity and force applied to a ball, while line defines the direction of the moving ball. The line can only be made by the golfer, but the speed can be aided by a more consistent roll. A top spin roll is generally most desired because it is less likely to be affected by bumps on the green which might otherwise effect the line of the ball. Many golf putter designs have attempted to aid the golfer in producing a moving ball that has an appropriate top spin roll. It is an object of the invention to define a new design that facilitates this result. Another problem with accuracy in putting is caused by ground interaction. A golfer usually lines up the putter with the ball (“at address”), brings the club back (“takeaway”), and then hits the ball and follows through. The desired results are obtained when the putter is kept exactly as the golfer intended it. However, the putter is usually touching the ground at address. During takeaway, the putter may interact with the ground (“ground interaction”). The golfer aims to keep the putter slightly above the ground during the rest of the takeaway and follow through. However, sometimes the putter does touch the ground. Even the most carefully manicured course includes some irregularities in its greens. This can affect the aiming of the putter, and hence effect the line of the ball. In recognition of this problem, it is an object of another aspect of the present invention to reduce the amount of interaction between the club and the green. This is preferably done by reducing the surface area of the surface of the club that interacts with the ground, using a new technique. It is often desirable to strike the golf ball near the center of gravity of the ball, i.e., its equator. The equator of a golf ball is usually around 0.75 inches off the ground, since a golf ball has a diameter of 1.5 inches. Another goal of the present invention is to aid the golfer in striking the ball at a consistent location. The present invention features an improved golf putter which includes a pair of ground engaging surfaces attached to downwardly extending areas called herein runners. The runners include downwardly-extending feet which extend from the bottom surface of the putter head at the head&#39;s heel and toe. Each runner has a surface area which is less than the entire area of the bottom surface of the putter. The runner also has a height which depends on the shape and mass of the putter. The height can range from ⅛-⅝ inches. During a stroke, this ground engaging surface becomes the lowermost area of the putter. If this surface does come into contact with the ground, the leading edge of the putter blade (“the blade”) is raised to a level which is slightly below the ball&#39;s equator. Since any putter generally does not touch the ground during a putt, the ball will be struck with an upward blow during a putting stroke. This action facilitates imparting the desirable top-spin roll to the golf ball. The runners also facilitate the blade striking the ball at a location that minimizes undesirable side spin or back spin which otherwise occurs when the ball is putt. The present invention defines improved structural aspects and surfaces which reduce the surface area that usually would come into contact with the ground. This thereby reduces the chance of ground interaction. The base of the runners of the present invention have a reduced ground engaging surface area, thereby reducing their interaction with the ground. The runners have a smaller surface area than the head itself to minimize interaction with the ground. The combined surface area of each runner can be in the range of 0.15-0.35 in 2 . The edge of the runners are preferably formed with a shape to further minimize interaction with the ground during a putting stroke, rounded, angled, or tapered. The positions of the runners also allow the user to place or “set” the putter relative to the ball in a consistent, well-defined way. During the takeaway, the head is more consistently brought back and then moved forward along a straight path which is collinear with the desired path of the ball. This facilitates consistent, accurate putting. As described above, a good putt involves proper speed and direction, including consistent speed and a desired direction from a straight takeaway and straight follow through. The present invention modifies speed by raising the blade, and modifies line by reducing the surface area. Another aspect of the present invention uses an insert at the blade surface that is formed of a different material than the material of the remainder of the golf club. That material may, for example, have an elasticity which is similar to that of the covering of the golf ball (e.g., rubber or plastic). The insert makes it possible to strike the golf ball with a consistent force. The insert also produces a desirable “dead hit” which further facilitates accurate putting.",

    "abstract": "This invention generally relates to a device for supporting a user in a seated position, and in one preferred embodiment, to a chair of the reclining back type. In another preferred embodiment, this invention relates to a chair having automatically adjusting armrests. In a further preferred embodiment, this invention relates to a chair having an adjustable headrest. In a still further preferred embodiment, this invention relates to a chair having an automatically adjusting resistance to tilting that increases in proportion to the weight of the user and as the tilt angle is increased. In a yet further preferred embodiment, the chair has a tilting mechanism which changes the angle of the seat and its support and increases the chair&#39;s angle of maximum recline, as well as providing a forward tilting position. 2. Description of the Related Art Reclining type chairs commonly used in offices usually provide for the back to recline alone, for the seat and back to recline as a unit, or the seat back may recline in a coordinated proportion with the seat. If the back alone pivots, it generally creates a problem known as “shirt tail pull.” This problem is particularly acute if the pivot of the chair back is not coordinated with the natural body action. This problem can also be accentuated by the tendency of the hips of the user to slide forward as the back tilts rearwardly. In chairs where both the seat and back recline as a unit, in the reclined position there is a tendency to lift the legs of the user from the floor creating an undue pressure by the forward edge of the seat against the underside of the legs of the user immediately above the knee. To overcome this problem the pivot point of the reclining action may be moved forward sufficiently to permit the user&#39;s feet to stay on the floor. The undesirable effect of this arrangement is that the body angle between the user&#39;s torso and legs is unchanged and as a result, the user&#39;s eye level drops undesirably when the chair is reclined. In any reclining chair, it is desirable that the recline pivot point be at the center of the body or where the user&#39;s back normally pivots (i.e., an axis through the user&#39;s hip joints). The pivot point of a reclining chair is normally displaced from the ideal pivot point. It is also desirable to have a chair wherein the angle between the user&#39;s torso and his legs opens up to relieve internal congestive body pressures. It is, of course, also desirable to provide a chair wherein the user&#39;s feet remain on the floor and the recline action parallels the natural body action closely enough to avoid the common shirt tail pull problem. It is also desirable to provide a chair which is of simplified construction and yet of clean, pleasing appearance emphasizing the isolated and separate appearance of the seat and back with respect to the supporting frames. My earlier U.S. Pat. No. 4,429,917 shows one approach to solving these problems. U.S. Pat. No. 4,943,114 to Piretti allegedly reports a chair with a compact backrest linkage mechanism that enables the chair backrest and seat to recline. U.S. Pat. No. 5,251,958 to Roericht et al. allegedly reports a chair with a synchronous adjusting device that uses the weight of the user to provide a restoring force to return the chair back to an upright position after a user has reclined in the chair. U.S. Pat. No. 5,486,035 to Koepke, et al., asserts, without providing any showing, that “In such constructions, the difficulty of reclining the chair, i.e., generating the reclining force, increases the further the chair is reclined, and it is common to employ adjusting apparatus for increasing or decreasing the reclining tension of a chair, such adjusting apparatus changing the tension of a spring, or otherwise modifying the reclining mechanism.” Col. 1, l. 29-34. While chairs with arms are well known in the art, heretofore, the arms have been either fixed, or adjustable. If the arms were adjustable, any adjustments have been less than ideal and/or quite cumbersome. Additionally, it was known in the art to put a headrest on a chair, including a reclinable chair. However, such headrests typically provided the chair occupant with very little support, i.e., when the chair is reclined, the headrest maintains its position relative to the back of the chair. Alternatively, if the headrest were to provide the chair occupant with substantial support, the headrest required awkward adjustments. Moreover, while it is believed that some reclining chairs heretofore available have had a means to adjust their resistance to reclining, such adjustments have been less than ideal, and/or very cumbersome and not practicable. Instead, rather than confront the processes necessary to adjust their chairs to fit the needs of their particular body build, most users of chairs use them without making any adjustments. Consequently, any ergometric advantages that might be delivered by the properly tuned chair are not achieved. Thus, there remains a need for a chair that is adjustable to the needs of the individual chair occupant without requiring any substantial effort on the occupant&#39;s part to effect the adjustments. In other words, a substantially self-adjusting ergometric chair. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION It is an object of one embodiment of the present invention is to provide an occupant-weight-operated chair having a reclinable back wherein the chair is of a simple economical construction and lends itself to high production manufacturing and fabrication procedures. A further object is the provision of a tilting chair wherein the frame supporting the seat and back are pivotally connected to the seat and fixedly connected to the back in a manner to emphasize the isolated and separate appearance of the seat and back. An alternative object is to provide armrests that are readily adjusted. These and other objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent as the following description proceeds.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates generally to apparatus and methods for harvesting of blood vessels and more particularly to an apparatus for separating and removing the sapiens vessel of the leg for use in bypass surgery with minimal tissue trauma. 2. Description of Related Art Healthy blood vessels are typically harvested to repair damaged vessels in other more critical parts of a human circulatory system. In particular, the sapiens vein is harvested from a patient&#39;s leg and utilized in bypass surgery where damaged and blocked arteries of the heart region of the patient are bypassed with the healthy blood vessel harvested. Typically, the surgeon will harvest an appropriate length of the leg vessel requiring that the vessel be safely separated from side branch vessels and leg tissue, followed by an appropriate dissection of the end of the harvested vessel. In early surgery of this type, incisions were made along the length of the sapiens vessel to be harvested which was then dissected from the surrounding tissue. More modern surgical techniques have been developed and are utilizing a broad variety of vessel harvesting instruments and apparatus which greatly reduce the trauma to the patient. The following U.S. Patents appear to represent at least a substantial portion of this more modern vessel harvesting technology. U.S. Pat. No. 6,660,016 to Linda discloses an endoscope apparatus for harvesting blood vessels including an endoscope barrel with a plurality of lumens, a handle disposed at a proximal end of the barrel and at lest one member for dissecting and cauterizing a blood vessel. An invention related to devices and methods for removing veins is taught by Spit in U.S. Pat. No. 6,352,544. David, et al., in U.S. Pat. No. 6,241,740 teaches a system and medical device for endoscopically ligating and cutting a body vessel, the improvements including a hinged jaw, an improved delivery system of a ligating clip and a rotating cutting instrument. A surgical instrument comprising an elongated hollow shaft having a longitudinal axis, a lumen, and an optical penetrating tip having a cylindrical portion attached to the distal end of the hollow shaft is taught by Kolata, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 6,206,823. U.S. Pat. No. 6,193,653 to Evans, et al. discloses methods and devices for harvesting vessels comprising a shaft having a handle mounted on one end and a dissecting tip on the other end. A light source is further optionally included and methods for transilluminating a vessel, dissecting the vessel, transecting the vessel and removing the vessel from the body are disclosed. A method and apparatus for the minimally invasive harvesting of veins is taught by Ginn, et al. in U.S. Pat. No. 6,022,313 and devices and methods for minimally invasive harvesting of a vessel are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 5,913,866. U.S. Pat.

U.S. Published Application US2005/0070940 to Genovesi, et al. teaches a method and device for harvesting vessels comprising a cannula-like device including means for identification, capture, manipulation, hemostasis and cleavage of branch vessels. That published application is a continuation application of U.S. Pat. No. 6,818,003 directed to a method and device for harvesting vessels. The harvesting cannula is configured as an elongated, hollow tube and comprised of three sections: a harvesting head, a tubular control segment and a sliding operation arm. Another published application to Hess, et al., US 2003/0065348 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,656,176, disclose endoscope vessel harvesting devices and methods.

    "abstract": "Ophthalmic topical drug delivery is one of the important methods of application, but the existence of cornea barrier, tears&#39; dilution and lacrimal passage&#39;s drainage effect limit the treatments and bioavailability of many topical ophthalmic preparations, especially for the posterior segment disease. In order for a high concentration in the Eyeball Vitreous, repeated intraperitoneal drug administration is necessary. However, repeated administration increases not only the patient&#39;s discomfort, but also the risk of operations and complications. On the other hand, ophthalmic drugs can be absorbed in nasal and oral cavity which increases the toxic or side effects during the treatment. Therefore for local effectiveness, many researchers want to explore a new drug carrier system to maintain the drug concentration for a longer period time, to increase effectiveness and to decrease the risk of complications and to gain the treatment goal. In recent years, many researches find that lots of slow and controlled-releasing agent like liposome and microsphere can maintain drug release for a longer time, and decrease the frequency of drug administration, reduce the drug concentration peak phenomenon, reduce the dosage and the toxicity. Biodegradable microspheres, compared to other agents, have the advantages of simple preparation, better stability and lower cost etc. Among all the drug delivery systems, only the microsphere formulations and solid implants can really result in controlled release, and microspheres formulations have the additional advantage of suspendability in a medium used as eye drops reducing the discomfort in the eyes. Microspheres are microspherical entities formed by dissolving or dispersing drugs in excipients. They are fine and uniform particles, can encapsulate drugs with poor water-solubility, and can be used to prepare drug formulations with sustained effected or for special targets. Usually those with particle size in the range of 1-250 μm are called microspheres, and those between 10-1000 nm are called nanoparticles. Commonly used particles have the size of 200 nm to 40 μm, and those used for ocular drug-delivery have the particle size no more than 10 μm, otherwise patients will feel ocular irritation. If the particles remain in the eyes after the drug-carrying microspheres drop into eyes, the microspheres will be more suitable for sustained and controlled release. As such, preparation of particle-based pharmaceutical formulations typically has a more stringent requirement for the control of the particle size. Among others, pilocarpine, β-receptor blockers, chloramphenicol, hydrocortisone, and Amikacin have been made into such formulations. Povidone iodine (PVP-I) is a complex of polyvinylpyrrolidone and iodine. It is also called iodophor and contains 9-12% effective iodine. It is a powerful disinfectant with a broad spectrum of applications and is strongly effective against viruses, bacteria, fungi, and mold spores. It causes little irritation on skin and has low toxicity and lasting effect, and can be used safely and easily. It basically does not cause irritation on tissue and widely used for skin and mucous membrane&#39;s disinfection, e.g., for pre-surgical cleaning and disinfection of surgical site and wound. The principle of sterilization is mainly through the release of hydrated iodine which has bactericidal effect. Povidone is hydrophilic and can carry iodine to cell membrane. When the complex arrives at the cell wall, the iodine is released and then complexes with amino acids of bacterial protein to denature it and, at the same time, oxidize the active groups of the bacteria&#39;s protoplasmic protein so that the bacteria dies rapidly. Povidone iodine is a very good bactericidal agent with no antibiotic resistance. In common use, povidone iodine&#39;s concentration is between 0.1% and 10%. Current povidone iodine preparations are in the forms of gel, suppository, cream, solution, with concentration ranging from 1% to 10%. (See Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2010 Edition). Povidone iodine eye drops have been widely used for the treatment of ocular infection basically with high concentrations of 5% with toxic effects that cannot be ignored. Grimes and others treated infected eyes repeatedly with 0.02% PVP-I eye drop which has the same germicidal effects as one with concentration of 5.0% povidone iodine but without the toxic affection and irritation. (See Grimes S R et al., Mil. Med., 1992, 157:111-113.) In order to retain a povidone iodine eye drop&#39; sterilizing effect, but also to eliminate its toxicity to eyes, clinical operation usually use PVP-I eye drops with concentration of 0.04% to disinfect eyes with no noticeable toxicity. However, at a low concentration, povidone iodine will degrade quickly and its concentration cannot be effectively maintained at the infected site due to the tear barrier effects. Therefore, in order to reduce the toxic effect on the eyes by povidone iodine at a high concentration meanwhile maintaining its pharmaceutical effect at the infected site, it is often necessary to prepare formulations with low toxicity and long-lasting effect. Among those currently controlled release formulations used for the eyes, ocular implants and microspheres formulations are more practical. In the treatment of ocular infections, application of ocular implants in the infected sites needs assistance by a physician, thereby greatly decreasing the patients&#39; medication compliance. As a result of strong oxidizing potential and acidity of povidone iodine, it is difficult to prepare povidone iodine microspheres from commonly used microsphere materials. Meanwhile, however, the microparticle technologies cannot be used to prepare effective system for the slow release of povidone iodine in the eyes. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The mammalian eye can be divided into two main segments: the anterior segment and the posterior segment. The anterior segment is the front third of the eye that includes the tissues in front of the vitreous humor: the cornea, iris, ciliary body, and lens. Within the anterior segment are two fluid-filled spaces: the anterior chamber and the posterior chamber. The anterior chamber is located between the posterior surface of the cornea (i.e. the corneal endothelium) and the iris. The posterior chamber is located between the iris and the front face of the vitreous. The posterior segment is the back two-thirds of the eye that includes the anterior hyaloid membrane and all tissues behind it: the vitreous humor, retina, choroid, and optic nerve. In some animals, the retina contains a reflective layer (the tapetum lucidum) which increases the amount of light each photosensitive cell perceives, allowing the animal to see better under low light conditions. The present invention generally relates to ophthalmic compositions each comprising a pharmaceutically acceptable excipient (e.g., water) and povidone-iodine (PVP-I) in microspheres formed by PVP-I and sodium alginate, and methods for using same for the treatment or prophylaxis of a disorder of at least one eye tissue. These ophthalmic compositions have the unexpected advantage of long stability (even under light) in an acidic environment (e.g., pH 1˜%) and are able to slowly release PVP-I in a controlled manner over an extended period of time in a neutral environment (e.g., pH 6.8-7.2) which is an ideal ophthalmic slow-release system. In some embodiments, the concentration of PVP-I in the ophthalmic compositions ranges from about 0.01% to about 10% (weight/weight or weight/volume), e.g., from about 0.01% to about 5%, from about 0.1% to about 5%, from about 0.1 to 2.5%, or from about 0.4 to about 2.0%, all by weight. In some embodiments, the PVP-I microspheres&#39; size ranges from 10 nm to 500 μm, e.g., from 10 nm to 1,000 nm, from 1 μm to 500 μm, from 1 μm to 250 μm, from 1 μm to 100 μm, from 100 nm to 100 μm, from 200 nm to 100 μm, from 200 nm to 10 μm, from 200 nm to 1,000 nm, from 500 nm to 1,000 nm, or from 10 nm to 500 nm. In some embodiments, the weight ratio of PVP-I and sodium alginate in the microspheres ranges from about 1:1 to about 1:5 (e.g., 1:1.2, 1:1.5, 1:1.8, 1:2, 1:2.5, 1:3, 1:3.5, 1:4, or 1:4.5). In some embodiments, the ophthalmic composition further includes calcium chloride and PVP-I (not in the microspheres) as stabilizing agents for the microspheres. The concentration of calcium chloride in the composition can range from about 0.08% to about 0.5% (e.g., from about 0.1% to about 0.5%, from about 0.1% to about 0.3%, from about 0.1% to about 0.25%, or from 0.2% to 0.25%) by weight. High calcium concentration may potentially lead to the risk of cataract. Calcium chloride can also be used as microsphere curing agent in preparation of microspheres with the preferred concentration by 1%-5%. The concentration of PVP-I as stabilizing agent can range from about 0.1% to about 5% (e.g., from about 0.1% to about 2.5%, from 0.1% to about 1%, from 0.2% to about 2.5%, from 0.5% to about 2.5%) by weight. In some embodiments, the microspheres&#39; concentration in the composition ranges from about 1% to about 25% (e.g., from about 1% to about 15%, from about 1% to about 10%, from about 5% to about 25%, from about 5% to about 10%, or from about 2.5% to about 10%) by weight.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a new and improved process for treating straw and other lignocellulose containing plant material with anhydrous ammonia to improve the nutritional value of the material. 2. Description of the Prior Art During the years extensive tests have been carried out with the ammoniation of plant material to increase its nutritional value. So far this has not resulted in a satisfactory, economical feasible process which is compatible with the well known Beckmann wet leaching method utilizing caustic alkali (NaOH). A process for ammoniation of agricultural plant material, such as sugar beet pulp and silage, is described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,293,845, H. C. Millar. The material to be treated is transferred to a heated autoclav and ammoniation with anhydrous gaseous ammonia is carried out under elevated temperature and superatmospheric conditions. The treatment will normally last from 15 minutes to 3 hours. A later patent, Norwegian Pat. No. 97581, Flemming Junker, relates to a somewhat similar process and specifies temperatures of preferably 60°-100° C for the ammoniation treatment under pressure. Utilizing ammonia under superatmospheric pressures and elevated temperatures, will according to the patent give practically speaking a total dissolution (decomposition) of the lignocellulose in the material. These prior known methods thus require the use of relatively complicated and expensive pressure apparatus and heating equipment. The prior art discloses that ammoniation by atmospheric pressure and ambient temperatures has also been investigated. According to British Pat. No. 1,280,922 a number of tests were carried out to determine how the ammonia could be intimately and substantially uniformly distributed into the plant material. A series of preliminary tests were carried out on plant material in the form of whole corn plants cut into smaller chops and having a dry matter content of about 45 percent. The chopped material was introduced into a large plastic bag contained inside an outer drum and ammonia was injected, after the air had been evacuated. The plant material in the drum then was stored for 4 months at room temperature. It was found that the incorporation of ammonia by such a method was not uniform, and this was particularly noticable at higher nitrogen levels. Consequently the preferred method of ammoniating at normal pressures and room temperatures was to add ammonia to the plant material in the form of an aqeous solution. Further Junker, in Norwegian Pat. No. 97581, claims that ammoniation by atmospheric pressure and without a specific heat treatment has serious drawbacks and that the elimination of pressure apparatus will give only 50-60% of the desirable alkali binding and accompanying increase in digestibility. Accordingly there does not so far exist a practical dry method for the ammoniation of straw and other plant materials containing lignocellulose working at atmospheric pressures and ambient temperatures. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The main object of the present invention is to provide a simple and inexpensive process for the ammoniation of plant material which can be directly applicable and utilized on individual farms and farmyards, requiring a minimum of investments. A further object of the invention is to provide a palatable product with satisfactory digestibility and improved nutritional value. Another object of the invention is to provide a process which minimizes adverse environmental effects and effluents. All these objects are obtained with the process according to the present invention where an assembly of straw or other plant material containing not less than 60 weight-percent dry vegetable matter is covered by a gas impervious material, and anhydrous ammonia is added in amounts excessive of the sum of the amount required for optimal irreversible nitrogen binding and the amount of reversibly bound nitrogen remaining in the straw after venting, and where the ammonia impregnated material is left at ambient temperature for a period of at least 10 days. We have found a surprisingly strong affinity between ammonia and straw with a dry matter content of at least 60 weight percent. At normal pressure and ambient temperatures such straw is able to absorb ammonia in great excess of the amount required to obtain optimal, irreversible nitrogen binding. The absorbtion is accompanied by a moderate increase in temperature, typically from 20°-40° C. Left at normal pressure and ambient temperature the temperature in the container holding the straw in a short time returns to ambient. This affinity is so strong that a pile of straw made up from several compressed bales of straw and enclosed in a container will be evenly penetrated by ammonia, even with a local injection of liquid ammonia in one of the bales of compressed straw, the ammonia will shortly afterwards have dispersed evenly into all the material in the pile. This is against the teachings of the above mentioned British Pat. No. 1,280,922, which states that the ammonia distribution becomes uneven at higher nitrogen levels. We believe that the high dry matter content in connection with the special fibrous structure of the plant material is of prime importance for the even distribution of ammonia. It is probably required for the straw to contain some moisture to get this absorbtion -- it has occured in our experiments with moisture contents of from 5-40%.",

    "abstract": "This invention is generally directed to pharmaceutical formulations with improved physical and chemical characteristics, comprising gabapentin in tablet form for oral administration. The tablet form can be prepared by spray-coating gabapentin with a binder solution and compressing the spray-coated gabapentin into non-friable, stable tablets. This invention is also generally directed to a method of producing pharmaceutical formulations in tablet form which contain large doses of active drug by spray-coating the active drug with a binder solution and compressing the spray-coated active drug into tablets. 2. Description of the Related Art Prior art methods for improving the compression characteristics of pharmaceutical formulations involve introducing additional excipients, such as microcrystalline cellulose, as compression aids to prevent fracturing of granules and tablets. However, the inclusion of additional excipients can be expensive and time consuming, can effect the stability of the active drug agent, and can increase the size of the tablet. Other methods for improving the compression characteristics of pharmaceutical formulations include dissolving the active drug in a binder solution to form a drug solution, spray drying the drug solution to form a powder and then compressing the powder into a tablet. This method, however, is inefficient because it requires a large amount of binder solution. Moreover, dissolving the active drug in a solution can cause stability problems, polymorph conversion, and changes in the crystalline structure of the drug. U.S. Pat. No. 4,874,614 issued to Becker, discloses a method of preventing the fracture of coated drug granules during the compression process by incorporating into a matrix, along with the granules, microcrystalline cellulose in the amount from 10% to 50% by weight of the total matrix. U.S. Pat. No. 5,725,884, issued to Sherwood et al., discloses the use of a microcrystalline cellulose based excipient comprising microcrystalline cellulose and silicon dioxide to improve the compressibility of the excipient microcrystalline cellulose, not the active drug substance. U.S. Pat. No. 5,534,551, U.S. Pat. No. 4,533,674, U.S. Pat. No. 4,605,666 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,710,519 all disclose a method of producing a compressible tablet by dissolving the active agent in a solvent and a binder then spray drying the solution to obtain a spray dried powder that is suitable for direct compression. IE 3089/90 issued to Augart, et. al., discloses a process for stabilizing pharmaceutical compositions containing gabapentin in solid form. The process entails hydrolyzing gabapentin with a semi-concentrated mineral acid and then converting gabapentin into a solid pharmaceutical composition containing hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidine, crospovidone, maize starch, cyclodextrin, talcum, co-polymer of dimethylaminomethacrylic acid and/or neutral methacrylic acid ester. Various patent applications and patents disclosing processes for preparing the gabapentin, and its methods of use are disclosed in PCT 98/28255, U.S. Pat. No. 4,024,175, U.S. Pat.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has been discovered that pharmaceutical formulations containing the active drug gabapentin can be produced with large doses of gabapentin but still be small enough for a patient to swallow. It has also been discovered that pharmaceutical formulations containing gabapentin in tablet form can be produced having improved characteristics such as hardness, friability and stability. It has further been discovered that the pharmaceutical formulations containing gabapentin can be produced in tablet form by spray-coating gabapentin particles with a binder solution and compressing the spray-coated particles into tablets. This method is also applicable to other pharmaceutical tablet formulations that require large doses of active drug for oral administration. Thus, one aspect of the present invention is a pharmaceutical tablet comprising more than about 76% by weight of gabapentin. A second aspect of the invention is a pharmaceutical tablet comprising more than about 76% by weight of gabapentin, a friability of less than about 1%, a hardness of about 10 kp to about 20 kp and a lactam level, a major degradation product of gabapentin, of less than about 0.4% by weight of the tablet composition. A first preferred embodiment of the invention is that the pharmaceutical tablet comprises more than about 88% by weight of gabapentin. A second preferred embodiment is that the tablet has a friability of less than about 0.8%. A third preferred embodiment is that the tablet has a hardness of about 14 kp to about 16 kp. A fourth preferred embodiment of the invention is that the tablet has a lactam level of less than 0.2%. An additional aspect of the invention is a pharmaceutical tablet comprising more than about 76% by weight of gabapentin, said tablet being formed from gabapentin particles spray-coated with a binder solution, mixed with a disintegrant and a lubricant, and then compressed into the tablet. Another aspect of the invention is a method of producing a pharmaceutical tablet comprising: dissolving binder in a solvent to produce a binder solution; spray-coating the binder solution on gabapentin particles to achieve spray-coated gabapentin particles; and compressing the spray-coated gabapentin particles into a tablet for oral administration to a patient, where the tablet contains more than 76% by weight of gabapentin.

    "abstract": "This invention relates to a patient monitoring system that is compatible with an environment having strong electrical and magnetic field levels, such as that found near a magnetic resonance imaging system. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Although a patient may physically appear to be in good health, cardiovascular conditions, such as stenosis, are difficult for a physician to confirm with just his five senses and training. Preventive care measures cannot be suggested because the physician has insufficient data to make a diagnosis. A magnetic resonance (MR) scanner is a medical diagnostic tool which can provide this data by imaging the anatomy, as well as performing in-vivo, non-invasive, spectroscopic analysis of stable patients. The patient is positioned in a homogeneous polarizing magnetic field B o  and then briefly excited by irradiation with a radio frequency at the Larmor frequency (f=yB o , where y=42.57 MHZ/Tesla). The MR signals emanating from the patient in response to the stimulus are observed. The MR scanner includes a magnet, frequently of solenoidal design, which produces the polarizing magnetic field, typically between 0.2 and 2.0 Tesla. The bore of the magnet has a large diameter to accommodate the RF, gradient, and shim coil assemblies, as well as the patient. A sliding patient tray is used to position the patient within the bore. The patient tray is longitudinally aligned with the magnet at a fixed height for patient positioning. If a patient undergoing a MR scan becomes critically ill, he must be quickly moved outside of the MR scanning room. This is necessary because most of the support equipment, (i.e. a defibrillator) used for critical patient care is not compatible with the MR scanning room environment. In the MR scanning room, there are strong magnetic and electric fields which may adversely affect the operation of the support equipment. Conversely, the support equipment may adversely affect the operation of the MR scanner. The strong magnetic and electric fields found in the MR scanning room make it difficult to monitor a patient&#39;s vital signs. Because of these strong fields, the patient&#39;s vital signs are sometimes observed on monitoring equipment located externally to the MR scanning room. Long cables are then required to connect the patient to the monitoring equipment. These cables are subjected to the strong electric and magnetic fields found in the MR scanning room. These conditions place extreme demands on the shielding properties of the interconnecting cables. The length of these cables may introduce unacceptable signal loss and degradation of the associated physiological parameter measurements. In addition, these cables tend to drape across the patient as they exit the bore of the magnet. This cable placement poses a potential interference to quickly evacuating a patient from the MR scanner in an emergency situation. In addition, the cables are subject to damage should they be run over by the patient transporter during the movement of the patient. As a result of these issues, critical care patients are not always provided with continuous monitoring of their vital signs during MR scanning. A patient monitoring system that is compatible with the MR scanning room environment and does not impede the transport of critical patients out of the scan room is therefore desirable. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A MR scanning room compatible patient monitoring system allows continuous monitoring of a patient&#39;s vital signs during the MR scans. This monitoring system may be mounted on the far end of the MR compatible patient transporter. The transporter is used to transfer the patient to and from the magnet in the MR scanning room. A fiber optic data link connects between the patient monitor, the MR scanner, and the control room. The MR compatible patient monitoring system has an shielded enclosure that acts as a Faraday shield. The patient monitor&#39;s microprocessor, LCD display, a control panel, a magnetic field sensor, a fiber optic data link, and at least one physio module are contained within the shielded enclosure. A clinician can observe the patient&#39;s vital signs on the LCD display and make any adjustments via the control panel.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to the preparation, by chemical synthesis, of methyl ecgonine phosphonates as analogues of transition states for the hydrolysis of the benzoyl ester bond in cocaine, and their linking to carrier proteins. By these methods, the phosphonates are produced rapidly in satisfactory yields. The resulting immunogens elicit the formation, in experimental animals, of antibodies capable of hydrolysis of cocaine. Both these catalytic antibodies and the immunogens used to induce them are potentially useful for the treatment of individuals at risk for the abuse of cocaine. Such compounds also are useful for immunodiagnostic purposes with respect to such individuals. BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION Cocaine is an ecgonine ester compound of the formula: ##STR1## (ref. 1--a list of references appears at the end of the descriptive text. This paper provides an overview of nomenclature. Compound names used in this specification are defined in this article). The abuse of cocaine represents a major threat to the social and economic fabric of many developed countries. Although several dopaminergic agents and the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine have been clinically tested, effective therapies to assist drug-addicted individuals in their return to drug-free life still are not available. Mobilizing the immune system to &#34;block&#34; drugs from reaching their sites of action in the central nervous system represents a potential, but as yet poorly explored, means of therapeutic intervention. It is well known that drugs of abuse can be rendered inactive by disrupting a structural feature either required for the interaction with their respective receptors or necessary for transport. Thus, in cocaine, the presence of the benzoyl ester moiety in the molecule is essential for maintaining its activity. Therefore, if antibodies possessing cocaine-specific esterase activity could be induced, such catalytic antibodies could potentially act in vivo to neutralize the pharmacological effects of the drug in an immunized individual. Enzymes and abzymes (otherwise known as catalytic antibodies) apparently employ a similar mechanism for the catalysis of hydrolysis. Abzymes, as any catalyst, lower the energy required to proceed through the transition state between the starting compound and the respective reaction products. Thus, a catalytic antibody binds to and stabilizes a shape corresponding to the transition state with little or no energy expenditure on the part of the substrate. Depending on the presence of other factors, the substrate then could proceed to the product or to return to its starting form. In the case of hydrolysis, water must be present, since the hydroxyl group of the water, due to its nucleophilic properties, enters the protransition state and forms the proper transition state for the hydrolysis, and the hydrolysis then takes place. Therefore, a catalytic antibody should be ideally made against such a transition state. However, since transition states are unstable by definition, antibodies have to be made against stable molecules which structurally mimic the transition state (transition state analogs). It has been established that the transition state (ref. 2) for carboxylate ester hydrolysis is centered around unstable formally &#34;pentavalent&#34; carbon, and consequently it can be mimicked by a stable phosphonate ester (ref. 3) since phosphorus is stable pentavalent and shapes and charge distribution of both resemble each other fairly closely. However, esters are among the most common functional groups in living organisms, and thus it is essential that the abzyme is devoid of any general esterase activity and is endowed with very specific benzoyl esterase activity in the context of the cocaine molecule. To achieve this objective, it is crucial that the transition state analog does not disrupt structural features defining specificity of interaction between cocaine and the recognition moiety of the abzyme. If this condition is not met, the antibodies made against such transition state analogs will not be sufficiently specific to be practical. It is recognized that polar groups in a molecule tend to be the focal point of B-cell (i.e. antibody reactive) epitopes. In cocaine, there are three polar groups, namely the bridgehead nitrogen (methylated), the methyl ester, and the benzoyl ester. As explained above, since the benzoyl ester is the target for the hydrolysis by a catalytic antibody, the transition state for the hydrolysis of the benzoyl ester can be mimicked by substituting phenylphosphonate for benzoate in the cocaine molecule. Such a phosphonate has to be linked to a carrier protein, as is conventionally required to enhance the immunogenicity of small molecules. Linkers have to be of appropriate length to maintain the transition state analog at the optimal distance from the antibody binding site. If the linker is too short, the carrier protein could interfere sterically, while, if it is too long, the linker may fold back to the protein, so that the transition state analog would adhere to the protein molecule or its fragments after processing. Four sites for anchoring the linker on the cocaine molecule are identifiable (listed in order of increasing synthetic difficulty): (i) a substitution of the N-methyl group by an alkyl chain, the other end of which is bound to a carrier protein (e.g. utilizing the amino group of a lysine in the carrier protein); (ii) a substitution of the methyl ester by a bifunctional molecule, such as a dicarboxylic acid, the other end of which again is bound to a carrier protein, either directly or through an extension chain; (iii) p-substitution at the phenyl ring of the phenylphosphonate group with a chain linked again to a carrier protein directly or through an extension chain; and (iv) a substitution of a ring hydrogen in the ecgonine ring system by a chain of carbon atoms, the other end of which is functionalized so that a bond to a carrier protein can be formed. Although the third choice (iii) appears to be the best one since it disturbs least of all the important recognition elements of cocaine and remains still within the reach of organic synthetic methodology for a possible future mass production, an attempt was described to link a phenylphosphonate analog of cocaine (ref. 4) via an alkyl chain originating in the nitrogen function utilizing anchoring site (i). Although a number of binding monoclonal antibodies have been isolated, none of them was endowed with the desired catalytic activity, thus confirming the conclusion of the discussion hereinabove. At least two attempts have been made utilizing the anchoring site (ii). The transition state analog using a specific linker (ref. 5) was described that using the state of the art methodology made possible isolation of two catalytic monoclonal antibodies with small, albeit detectable catalytic activity. Identical transition state analogs using a different linker to BSA or KLH (compounds 5a, 5b, FIG. 1--ref. 6) gave a polyclonal binding antibody in rabbits, and several binding monoclonal antibodies, none of them endowed with catalytic activity. This result could be expected, as it has been outlined hereinabove.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to apparatus for measuring muscle movement. More specifically, the present invention relates to signal processing of muscle contraction signals generated by a pair of transceivers which are disposed adjacent the muscle to be monitored. The present invention is particularly, though not exclusively, useful for measuring contractions of the heart muscle during or after cardiovascular surgery. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is well known that muscle contractions can be measured by attaching transducers to the muscle and detecting signals generated by the transducers that are proportional to the distance between the attachment points. One device that has been used for this purpose employs a transducer consisting of an elastic tube which is filled with a conductive fluid. To operate this device, the ends of the tube are sutured in tension to the muscle whose displacement or contraction is to be measured. As the muscle moves, the length of the tube changes and, consequently, the electrical resistance of the tube also changes. Unfortunately, such a device has the disadvantage that it must be sutured to the muscle. Thus, it is not able to respond well to very small displacements, or to displacements which occur within a short period of time. In addition, such devices are more prone to cause injury or trauma to the muscle during their attachment and removal. Another device, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,937,212 to Fletcher et al., pertains to a miniature muscle displacement transducer. It senses muscle displacement or contraction utilizing a curved structural beam of high elastic compliance which is connected at its ends to two prongs. A sensitive strain gauge is bonded to the beam to generate an output that is directly related to changes in the beam curvature. As the muscle under observation expands and contracts, the prongs move and the beam curvature correspondingly experiences changes, which are detected by the strain gauge. No suturing is required with this apparatus. Instead, the pair of elongated prongs, which are oriented substantially parallel to one another and disposed in a plane which is substantially perpendicular to the plane of the curved beam, have sharp tips that are insertable into the muscle. The transducer must be fabricated and calibrated, however, to correlate its output signal changes as a function of changes in beam curvature. Moreover, it measures lateral contractions, and due to parallel positioning of the elongated probes, is not well suited to measure displacement between opposite sides of the muscle, such as is required when measuring the ventricular muscle of the heart. It is also well known that ultrasonic transducers can be attached to a muscle to measure the variations in distance between the transducers as an indication of the muscle&#39;s movement and activity. Such ultrasonic transducers provide increased sensitivity, and can detect very small changes in the relative positions of the transducers within very small increments of time. Thus, ultrasonic transducers are able to provide an effective real-time representation of muscle activity. Unfortunately, conventional methods using such crystal ultrasonic transducers require the tranducers be sutured to the muscle to assure the transducers are properly held in place. In addition, the transducers must be properly aligned so the ultrasound energy is adequately focused between the transmitter and receiver to provide useful and accurate muscle activity information. Other transducers using sonomicrometry (e.g. piezoelectric crystals) to detect variations in heart muscle movement, have attempted to solve the problem of maintaining alignment of the crystal transducers. Some have used various shaped crystals which have larger beam widths and greater sensitivity with which to overcome any misalignment. These devices, however, still require implantation in the epicardium using a securing ring. Such a device is disclosed in the article entitled &#34;An Improved Transducer for Measurement of Cardiac Dimensions with Sonomicrometry&#34; by Trigt et al., American Physiological Society, 1981. Yet another genre of transducer is disclosed in co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 383,205, assigned to the same assignee as the present invention, which recognizes the need for a sonomicrometry system that can accurately measure heart contractions to monitor performance of the heart during cardiovascular surgery, and to warn immediately when a problem occurs. This invention provides for heart contraction monitoring without requiring suturing and prealignment of the transducers by attaching the sonic transducers to a transducer caliper for attachment to the heart muscle. With specific regard to the heart muscle, the obvious desirability for relatively small sized transducers, unfortunately, is offset by the relatively low sound pressure levels produceable by these small transducers. Specifically, the generation and processing of meaningful electronic signals from low sound pressure levels is complicated. For example, the sound pressure level of the transmitted ultrasonic signal is on the order of one (1) microvolt. Furthermore, this signal undergoes significant attenuation as it crosses the heart and is occasionally undetected by the receiving transducer. Moreover, the detection problem is compounded by a relatively large amount of sonic background noise in the heart. Consequently, it is often the case that false detection signals are generated by the receiving transducer in response to noise, as opposed to a bona fide measurement transmission. These false signals are preferably rejected during the signal processing in order to present operators with more meaningful data. It will be understood, therefore, that given the inherent complexity of conditioning the relatively weak and often erratic heart measurement signals noted above, a signal processor is desired which can quickly perform relatively complicated signal processing of the signals generated by relatively small sized ultrasonic transducers. Relatively high degrees of processing speed and data flow rate are even more important in light of medically-based requirements for a high degree of heart size measurement accuracy, in addition to the requirement for a relatively large data flow. For example, it can be required that the transducer system suggested above produce 1000 heart size measurements per second, and that each measurement be accurate to within one-tenth of one millimeter. Accordingly, it will be understood that the speed and capacity of digital microprocessors make them attractive as signal processors for the kinds of sonomicrometry devices noted above. In accordance with the discussion above, the present invention recognizes that a need exists to provide a heart contraction monitor which can process, store, and display a large number of measurements per unit time. The present invention also recognizes that a need exists to provide a heart contraction monitor which can recognize and reject heart size measurement signals that are unreasonably large or small. In addition, the present invention recognizes that a need exists to provide a heart contraction monitor which can control and monitor the pulsing of a sonic transducer system for measuring heart size. Finally, the present invention recognizes that a need exists to provide a heart contraction monitor which is relatively easy to operate and cost effective to manufacture. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An apparatus for determining the magnitude of heart muscle contractions comprises an ultrasonic transmitter and an ultrasonic receiver which are respectively positioned in sonic alignment at selected points on the surface of the heart muscle. The apparatus further comprises a microprocessor that is electronically connected to a counter and the counter, in turn, is electronically connected to both the ultrasonic transmitter and ultrasonic receiver. As intended here, the ultrasonic transmitter is used for generating a series of pulses of ultrasonic energy that are each sent from the transmitter, through the heart muscle, to the receiver. For each pulse transmission, the counter digitally measures the time it takes each pulse of ultrasonic energy to transit the heart muscle between the transmitter and the receiver. These digitally measured pulse transit times are then electronically transferred from the counter to the microprocessor, where a plurality of sequential pulse transit times are summed during a predetermined sampling period. This sum is then averaged to generate a digitized signal which is representative of the distance between the transmitter and the receiver during the sampling period. In order to evaluate and analyze the distance signals as indications of heart muscle contractions, the signals generated by the counter are transferred to the microprocessor. At the microprocessor, the signals are sequentially processed to create a time history of the distances between the transmitter and the receiver. This time history is electronically storable for archival purposes and is also presentable in selected segments to visually show the magnitude of the contractions of the heart muscle. In order to use meaningful data for the generation of the muscle contraction time history, any obviously erroneous transit times which could greatly distort a distance signal are ignored by the microprocessor. Specifically, any transit times which would indicate a heart size that is, for example, in the range of twenty-five to thirty percent (25%-30%) greater, or lesser, than should be reasonably expected, are not used by the microprocessor in the generation of the distance signal. Further, in the event no usable transit times are received by the microprocessor during the sampling period, the distance signal for that sampling period is given an inherently meaningless value of zero. As intended for the present invention, the ultrasonic transmitter is excited at a frequency of approximately one kilohertz (1 KHz). Thus, approximately one thousand (1000) pulses of ultrasonic energy transit the heart muscle between the transmitter and the receiver each second. Further, each distance signal is preferably generated using eight (8) sequential transit times. Consequently, approximately 7500 distance signals are generated each minute. For the presentation of a muscle contraction time history using calculated data, the generated series of distance signals can be presented in a time sequence on either hard copy (i.e. paper) or on a liquid crystal display. Thus, sequential heart muscle contractions can be viewed over a preselected time interval (e.g. three seconds). Further, during each such time interval, the microprocessor is able to record and store the measured data pertaining to the maximum and minimum values of the distance obtained during signals the preselected time interval. With this data, long term trends for heart muscle contractions can be viewed and evaluated. The novel features of this invention, as well as the invention itself, both as to its structure and its operation, will be best understood from the accompanying drawings, taken in conjunction with the accompanying description, in which similar reference characters refer to similar parts, and in which:",

    "abstract": "Embodiments described herein relate to an apparatus and method for detection and treatment of atrial fibrillation. More specifically, embodiments described herein relate to an apparatus and method for detection and treatment of atrial fibrillation using distributed bipolar electrodes placed on the surface of the heart to detect the earliest onset of fibrillation. The heart has four chambers, the right and left atria and the right and left ventricles. The atria serve as primer pumps to the ventricles which in turn pump blood to the lungs (the right ventricle) or the aorta and the remainder of the body (the left ventricle). The heart is essentially and electromechanical pump, which contracts and pumps blood by means of a wave of depolarization that spreads from the atria to the ventricles in a timed fashion through a series of conduction pathways. Cardiac arrhythmia is a condition afflicting the heart and is characterized by abnormal conduction patterns which in turn can affect the pumping efficiency in one of more chambers of the heart. It can occur in either the atria, ventricles or both. Particular types of Atrial arrhythmia can cause a condition known as atria fibrillation (AF) in which the pumping efficiency of the atria are compromised. Instead of contracting in a coordinated fashion, the left or right atria flutter with little or no pumping efficiency. During an episode of AF, the normal electrical impulses that are generated by the sino-atrial node (the SA node), the natural pacemaker of the heart are overwhelmed by disorganized electrical impulses, known as ectopic foci that may originate in the atria or pulmonary veins, leading to conduction of irregular impulses to the atria and the ventricles. This can result in an irregular heartbeat, known as an arrhythmia which may occur in episodes lasting from minutes to weeks, or years. Left unchecked, AF often progresses to become a chronic condition. Atrial fibrillation is often asymptomatic, and while not immediately life-threatening, may result in palpitations, fainting, chest pain (angina), or congestive heart failure. Patients with AF have a significantly increased risk of stroke and pulmonary embolism due to the tendency of blood to pool and form clots or emboli in the poorly contracting atria which are then sent to the lungs in the case of the right atria causing pulmonary embolism, or the brain causing stroke. Atrial fibrillation may be treated with medications, implanted ventricular defibrillators or surgical procedures. The current medications used either slow the heart rate or revert the heart rhythm back to normal. However patients must remain on medication for life and many patients cannot be successfully treated with medication. Implanted ventricular defibrillators may be used to deliver a series of high voltage electric shocks to convert AF to a normal heart rhythm in a technique known as synchronized electrical cardioversion. However, these shocks are extremely painful and may cause the patient to pass or literally be knocked to the ground from the shock. Surgical and catheter-based therapies may also be used to ablate or destroy portions of the atria and pulmonary veins containing the ectopic and other foci responsible for the generation of arrhythmias causing AF; however these require open heart surgery, cardiac catheterization or both and have met with limited success. Thus, there is a need for improved methods and devices for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.",

    "abstract": "The invention is directed to devices, systems, and methods for improving the function of a heart valve, e.g., in the treatment of mitral valve regurgitation. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION I. The Anatomy of a Healthy Heart The heart (see  FIG. 1 ) is slightly larger than a clenched fist. It is a double (left and right side), self-adjusting muscular pump, the parts of which work in unison to propel blood to all parts of the body. The right side of the heart receives poorly oxygenated (“venous”) blood from the body from the superior vena cava and inferior vena cava and pumps it through the pulmonary artery to the lungs for oxygenation. The left side receives well-oxygenation (“arterial”) blood from the lungs through the pulmonary veins and pumps it into the aorta for distribution to the body. The heart has four chambers, two on each side—the right and left atria, and the right and left ventricles. The atria are the blood-receiving chambers, which pump blood into the ventricles. A wall composed of membranous and muscular parts, called the interatrial septum, separates the right and left atria. The ventricles are the blood-discharging chambers. A wall composed of membranous and muscular parts, called the interventricular septum, separates the right and left ventricles. The synchronous pumping actions of the left and right sides of the heart constitute the cardiac cycle. The cycle begins with a period of ventricular relaxation, called ventricular diastole. The cycle ends with a period of ventricular contraction, called ventricular systole. The heart has four valves (see  FIGS. 2 and 3 ) that ensure that blood does not flow in the wrong direction during the cardiac cycle; that is, to ensure that the blood does not back flow from the ventricles into the corresponding atria, or back flow from the arteries into the corresponding ventricles. The valve between the left atrium and the left ventricle is the mitral valve. The valve between the right atrium and the right ventricle is the tricuspid valve. The pulmonary valve is at the opening of the pulmonary artery. The aortic valve is at the opening of the aorta. At the beginning of ventricular diastole (i.e., ventricular filling)(see  FIG. 2 ), the aortic and pulmonary valves are closed to prevent back flow from the arteries into the ventricles. Shortly thereafter, the tricuspid and mitral valves open (as  FIG. 2  shows), to allow flow from the atria into the corresponding ventricles. Shortly after ventricular systole (i.e., ventricular emptying) begins, the tricuspid and mitral valves close (see FIG.  3 )—to prevent back flow from the ventricles into the corresponding atria—and the aortic and pulmonary valves open—to permit discharge of blood into the arteries from the corresponding ventricles. The opening and closing of heart valves occur primarily as a result of pressure differences. For example, the opening and closing of the mitral valve occurs as a result of the pressure differences between the left atrium and the left ventricle. During ventricular diastole, when ventricles are relaxed, the venous return of blood from the pulmonary veins into the left atrium causes the pressure in the atrium to exceed that in the ventricle. As a result, the mitral valve opens, allowing blood to enter the ventricle. As the ventricle contracts during ventricular systole, the intraventricular pressure rises above the pressure in the atrium and pushes the mitral valve shut. FIG. 4  shows a posterior oblique cutaway view of a healthy human heart  100 . Two of the four heart chambers are shown, the left atrium  170 , and the left ventricle  140  (not shown are the right atrium and right ventricle). The left atrium  170  fills with blood from the pulmonary veins. The blood then passes through the mitral valve (also known as the bicuspid valve, and more generally known as an atrioventricular valve) during ventricular diastole and into the left ventricle  140 . During ventricular systole, the blood is then ejected out of the left ventricle  140  through the aortic valve  150  and into the aorta  160 . At this time, the mitral valve should be shut so that blood is not regurgitated back into the left atrium. The mitral valve consists of two leaflets, an anterior leaflet  110 , and a posterior leaflet  115 , attached to chordae tendineae  120  (or chords), which in turn are connected to papillary muscles  130  within the left atrium  140 . Typically, the mitral valve has a D-shaped anterior leaflet  110  oriented toward the aortic valve, with a crescent shaped posterior leaflet  115 . The leaflets intersect with the atrium  170  at the mitral annulus  190 . In a healthy heart, these muscles and their chords support the mitral and tricuspid valves, allowing the leaflets to resist the high pressure developed during contractions (pumping) of the left and right ventricles. In a healthy heart, the chords become taut, preventing the leaflets from being forced into the left or right atria and everted. Prolapse is a term used to describe the condition wherein the coaptation edges of each leaflet initially may coapt and close, but then the leaflets rise higher and the edges separate and the valve leaks. This is normally prevented by contraction of the papillary muscles and the normal length of the chords. Contraction of the papillary muscles is simultaneous with the contraction of the ventricle and serves to keep healthy valve leaflets tightly shut at peak contraction pressures exerted by the ventricle. II. Characteristics and Causes of Mitral Valve Dysfunction Valve malfunction can result from the chords becoming stretched, and in some cases tearing. When a chord tears, the result is a flailed leaflet. Also, a normally structured valve may not function properly because of an enlargement of the valve annulus pulling the leaflets apart. This condition is referred to as a dilation of the annulus and generally results from heart muscle failure. In addition, the valve may be defective at birth or because of an acquired disease, usually infectious or inflammatory. FIG. 5  shows a cutaway view of a human heart  200  with a prolapsed mitral valve. The prolapsed valve does not form a tight seal during ventricular systole, and thus allows blood to be regurgitated back into the left atrium during ventricular contraction. The anterior  220  and posterior  225  leaflets are shown rising higher than normal (i.e., prolapsing) into the left atrium. The arrows indicate the direction of regurgitant flow. Among other causes, regurgitation can result from redundant valve leaflet tissue or from stretched chords  210  that are too long to prevent the leaflets from being blown into the atrium. As a result, the leaflets do not form a tight seal, and blood is regurgitated into the atrium. FIG. 6  shows a cutaway view of a human heart  300  with a flailing mitral valve  320 . The flailing valve also does not form a tight seal during ventricular systole. Blood thus regurgitates back into the left atrium during ventricular contraction, as indicated by the arrows. Among other causes, regurgitation can also result from torn chords  310 . As an example,  FIG. 7  shows a cutaway view of a human heart where the anterior leaflet  910  has torn chords  920 . As a result, valve flailing and blood regurgitation occur during ventricular systole. As a result of regurgitation, “extra” blood back flows into the left atrium. During subsequent ventricular diastole (when the heart relaxes), this “extra” blood returns to the left ventricle, creating a volume overload, i.e., too much blood in the left ventricle. During subsequent ventricular systole (when the heart contracts), there is more blood in the ventricle than expected. This means that: (1) the heart must pump harder to move the extra blood; (2) too little blood may move from the heart to the rest of the body; and (3) over time, the left ventricle may begin to stretch and enlarge to accommodate the larger volume of blood, and the left ventricle may become weaker. Although mild cases of mitral valve regurgitation result in few problems, more severe and chronic cases eventually weaken the heart and can result in heart failure. Mitral valve regurgitation can be an acute or chronic condition. It is sometimes called mitral insufficiency. III. Prior Treatment Modalities",

    "abstract": "The invention relates to the field of ultrasound diagnosis of the cardiovascular systen, particular methods and devices for providing both ultrasound amplitude images and Doppler data from blood flow. 2. Relation to Prior Art Techniques for ultrasonic blood flow velocity measurement based on the Doppler principle and echo amplitude imaging employing ultrasonic pulses are regarded as prior art, and the invention relates to a combination of these for virtually simultaneous measurements in real time. The method may be implemented by making small modifications in commercial imaging and blood velocity measuring apparati and interconnecting these through a central control unit. The image of the biological structure is shown on a suitable display screen, and the region in which the blood flow velocity is measured is shown on the same screen. A useful spectrum analysis of the received Doppler signal may also be shown on the display and possibly printed out on a suitable printer. The object of the invention is to simplify the aiming-in of the ultrasonic head or transducer(s) during Doppler measurement of blood velocity, by utilizing the echo amplitude image for determining the region in which the blood velocity is measured. By combining the blood velocity measurement with a dimensional measurement of blood vessels, it is possible to estimate or calculate the actual volume flow in the vessel. A very important consideration when using equipment of the type concerned here is that the Doppler signal is presented in audible form, for example in a loudspeaker. The operator carrying out an investigation will to a high degree use the information being presented via the audio Doppler signal, in order to seek regions in the blood system in which more detailed measurement or imaging may be of interest. Therefore, it is very important that the Doppler signal presented audibly is not substantially disturbed or distorted. Equipment for two-dimensional imaging of biological structures in real time on the basis of the amplitude of echos from a short ultrasonic pulse, is commercially available. Such known equipment is found in two versions: Equipment based upon sectorial scan of the ultrasonic beam which may be obtained either with a phase controlled transducer arrangement (array), or with a mechanically steerable transducer. Equipment based upon a linear scan of the ultrasonic beam which is obtained either with electronic selection of elements in a linear array of transducers, or with a linear mechanical movement of a single transducer. Equipment for ultrasonic Doppler measurement of blood flow velocity is also commercially available and there are two fundamental methods: Pulsed Wave Ultrasonic Doppler Measurement: This makes possible a depth resolution along the ultrasonic beam so that one may measure the velocity in a small region. There may also be used multi-depth sampling so that it will be possible to measure the velocity at several depths simultaneously. The pulse wave method has a disadvantage to the effect that there is a limitation of the maximum velocity which may be measured, given by the pulse rate repetition and ultrasonic frequency which is employed. Continuous Wave Ultrasonic Doppler Measurement: With this method there will not be obtained any depth resolution along the ultrasonic beam. In exchange there is no limitation of the maximum velocity which may be measured. There are commercial instruments available which can select either pulsed wave or continuous wave operation. There is also commercially available equipment which combines echo amplitude imaging and Doppler blood velocity measurements. Three principles have been used: (a) The image is frozen on the display during manual control and the ultrasonic head is utilized for Doppler measurement of blood velocity. (b) Every second ultrasonic pulse which is emitted is utilized for Doppler velocity measurement and intermediate pulses are utilized for echo amplitude imaging. In other words, the pulses alternately serve the Doppler measurement and the amplitude imaging. This gives a simultaneous measurement of Doppler frequency and amplitude image in real time at the cost of reduced pulse repetition frequency for the Doppler instrument [1]. (c) Finally there is a design in which several Doppler pulses are emitted as a contiguous train having repetitive interruptions for a single echo amplitude imaging pulse, for example after every tenth Doppler pulse [2]. The above methods of interrelating amplitude imaging and Doppler measurement have deficiencies and disadvantages as follows: (i) With the frozen image, movements of the measuring head or the object of measurement when the image is frozen, will give faulty indications of the region in which the velocity is measured. (ii) With alternate emission of Doppler and imaging pulses, the emission rate of the Doppler pulses will be reduced so that the maximum velocity which may be measured, is reduced.",

With sufficient intensity, duration and repetition rate, the induced electrical currents may evoke action potential of neurons, muscle fibers and endocrine cells. The advantage of the methods using magnetic field compared with electrotherapeutical methods is that changing magnetic field therapy does not require contact with the patient and can be performed through clothing. With magnetic field treatments, the stimulating signal does not pass through the skin. Rather, the electrical currents are induced directly in the stimulated tissue.

The balloon is arranged to receive a fluid therein that inflates the balloon. The catheter further includes first and second electrodes within the balloon arranged to receive there-across a high electrical voltage at an initial low current. The high electrical voltage causes an electrical arc to form across the first and second electrodes within the balloon.

The system further includes a power source that provides the first and second electrodes with the high electrical voltage at the initial current and that terminates the high electrical voltage in response to the high current flow through the first and second electrodes. The power source includes a current sensor that senses current flowing through the first and second electrodes.

    "abstract": "A peanut food product with reduced levels of allergenic protein Ara h1 is produced by initiating the germination process in raw peanuts, holding the peanuts in moist conditions for a period of time, typically something like 48 hours, roasting the peanuts, and then performing an assay for Ara h1 to verify that a reduced level has been achieved. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIG. 1  is a flow chart showing an embodiment of the invention. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Peanuts contain certain proteins which cause allergic reactions in some people. One of these proteins is known as Ara h1. It has been discovered that the amount of Ara h1 in peanuts may be reduced or eliminated by the method disclosed herein. The method comprises two steps. First, raw peanut seeds are put into contact with water and maintained in an environment suitable to cause the germination process and embryo development to be initiated. Then, after about 48 hours, the seeds are gathered and roasted. A suitable time and temperature for this roasting has been found to be 60 minutes in a home-style, non-convection oven at a temperature of 350 F. After the roasting step, the peanuts may then be subjected to an assay for determining the presence of Ara h1 to verify that the resulting product is, indeed, hypoallergenic. It has been found that both of these steps are required for the hypoallergenic effect to be observed. Peanuts which are roasted without undergoing the germination process retain high levels of Ara h1. Unroasted peanuts which are subjected to germinating conditions even for 48 hours or more also test with high levels of Ara h1. It is only when peanuts are subject to germinating conditions for an effective period of time, and then roasted, that a greatly decreased level of Ara h1 is observed. The experimental procedure for implementing this invention in the laboratory was as follows. Reference numbers pertain to Drawing  FIG. 1 : BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1  is a flow chart showing exemplary steps of the inventive method. 1. Raw (that is, unroasted) peanuts  101 , without shells, but with the brown paper skin intact, were obtained from Whole Foods, a Seattle-area grocery vendor.   2. The nuts were surface sterilized  102  by soaking in a 10% solution of Clorox bleach for 15 minutes.   3. The nuts were then double rinsed with sterile water, and then moistened by soaking in sterile water for 6 hours.   4. A sterile paper towel moistened with sterile water was then placed in a glass tray, the nuts were layered atop the towel, and a similar covering towel was placed on top. The towels and nuts were formed into a roll, enclosed in a layer of plastic films to retain moisture, and kept in sterile conditions at room temperature (22 C) for given lengths of time. This step initiated the germination process of the seeds. A length of time  103  of about 48 hours was found effective.   5. The nuts were then taken from the towel roll and subjected to heat treatment, roasting  104 , and then assay  105 , so that the results of roasting could be determined.",

    "abstract": "Typical products  19  which are treated in the fryer  10  include, for example, onion rings as well as other vegetables; meats such as chicken and beef as well as fish. These food products as choice can be first dipped in a viscous batter and then covered with a layer of bread crumbs or similar coating which adheres to the batter, thus increasing the weight of the product. Unless handled carefully in the cooking operation, a portion of the breading or other coating will not adhere to the product and will fall into the cooking oil which is undersirable as discussed above. Desribed below are steps which materially reduce the amount of brad and batter material stripped from the product through the cooking operation when such products are so breaded. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A number of successfully marketed food products, chicken, beef, fish, filled dough, vegetables, etc. sometimes are prepared by coating or battering the product and covering the coating with bread crumbs or the like and frying thereafter. During the frying step in which the product is either partially or fully cooked, it is highly desirable that as much of the breading or other coating be retained on the product and that a very minimum of the coating slough off into the cooking oil. When particles of the coating break away from the product, this results in a lower production yield and the fines sloughed off contaminate the frying oil. These breading and product fines must be removed from the frying medium on a regular basis to avoid degrading the cooking oil to a point where it must be supplemented by a higher quality oil or else removed for recycling. This event places a high economic burden on control of the cooking oil as well as control on the battered and breaded product. Maintaining a balance between product yield and oil quality has been a challenge which faced food processors over a long period of time. This is true as well of the non breaded and battered products that comprises the bulk of the market. Prior art equipment and techniques were developed in attempts to minimize the removal of breading or other coatings from the underlying food product. In the conventional hot oil cooking fryer substantial turbulence or “boil” is generated when the relatively cold uncooked food product is dropped into the hot cooking oil. This turbulence contributed to removal of portions of coatings and continued to a lesser degree as the product is conveyed through and cooked in the hot oil bath. To overcome this undesirable effect food processors turned to cooking the products in batch cookers where the relative motion between the product and the cooking oil would be quite low, although the initial turbulence or “boil” was always present. Other procedures involved cooking in ovens after applying an oil spray coating as a preparatory step to the oven cooking. Gentle handling of the coated product while cooking was a desired goal but rarely achieved to complete satisfaction for high product yields with high production output. It is highly desirable to minimize the relative motion between the bread and battered product and the cooking medium, whether the cooking medium is cooking oil or a process cooking vapor. This is evident because a rapidly moving cooking medium is more than likely the cause of portions of the bread coating to be removed from the product which thereby reduces the yield on the one hand and produces contamination of the cooking medium on the other. Where the choice is made to cook a breaded and batter product in cooking oil there are substantial advantages in using the minimum practical amount or volume of cooking oil. However where the product fryer has a large bath of cooking oil, the large air-oil surface and the consequent exposure of the cooking oil to air causes the oil to degrade. Replacement of the complete oil bath or make-up oil must be supplied to maintain or uphold the desired cooking oil quality. Shoed the oil degrade significantly, there will be caused an “off taste” to be imparted to the product. This must be guarded against to avoid product rejection for quality control reasons as well as to postpone the costly replacement of the degraded oil. In the prior art use of a reduced volume of cooking oil has been thought to be impractical where high product output is the goal. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION AND OBJECTS In summary, the invention is comprised of an improved fryer for treating a food product with hot cooking oil gently dispensed from above onto the food product. The food products are normally mechanically delicate. The fryer is comprised of a housing defining an enclosed cooking zone and having exhaust vents for withdrawing cooking vapors and odors therefrom. A main endless conveyor with variable speed drive is provided for transporting the food product through the cooking zone and includes a conveyor belt through which cooking oil may flow freely. A submerger conveyor may be provided arranged superimposed on the main conveyor, for submerging products which tend to float. A plurality of cooking oil inlet distribution stations are spaced longitudinally apart along said main conveyor and are arranged above the product carrying conveyor belt a distance sufficient to permit the product to pass thereunder. The cooking oil distribution stations extend substantially the full-width of the conveyor belt for treating the food products as they are carried through the fryer housing. Each cooking oil inlet distribution station includes a cooking oil reservoir of relatively small surface area exposed to the steam/air atmosphere and equipped with at least one overflow weir permitting the cooking oil to flow there over in an unbroken vertical curtain downwardly onto and over such food product carried upon the conveyor belt. A cooking oil feed conduit serves to supply each cooking oil distribution station, the feed conduit having multiple discharge openings disposed in the reservoir below the atmosphere-oil surface level so that as oil flows over as the weir in a curtain enrobing the product, the reservoir is resupplied with oil beneath the oil liquid level. Another feature permits cooking a product while it is fully submerged in cooking oil in which application the distribution station provides for the gentle return to the fryer of the externally heated cooking oil while maintaining a substantially uniform oil temperature along the length of the fryer. In another aspect the invention comprises an improved process for treating a food product such as one which typically carries a pre-cook coating that is fragile and easily dislodged if safeguards are not taken, comprising the steps of providing a fryer having an endless conveyor including a conveyor belt through which oil can flow freely, and providing a volume of cooking oil in the fryer, and maintaining the oil level such that the food products carried on the conveyor are not completely submerged in the cooking oil, placing such food products with the fragile coating on the conveyor at a loading station for treatment in the fryer, then moving the food products towards an unloading station while dispensing from above the conveyor and onto the product at least one smooth, flowing curtain of hot oil, and controlling the oil flow so that it flows downwardly, continuously in a curtain of oil covering coating and enveloping the food product on the conveyor sometimes referred to as an “enrobing” process—and then removing the treated food product from the fryer at the unloadig station. A general object of the invention is to provide an improved breaded products fryer for continuously processing a breaded and battered product that is fragile by applying cooking oil to the product from dispensing stations arranged above the product such that the oil will free fall in a curtain onto the product and cook the product in an enrobing action. Another object of the invention is to provide an improved breaded products fryer of the type described wherein the volume of cooking oil utilized is substantially less than that in prior art fryers of similar capacity and where in the tendency of oil to degraders correspondingly less than in prior art fryers. Still another object of the invention is to provide an improved breaded products fryer wherein a continuous product conveyor is arranged in a fryer pan such that the return run of the conveyor continuously sweeps the conveyor bottom moving loose bits of product, crumbs and other fines to a fines removal facility or oil outlet sump on the fryer which may be positioned proximate to the product inlet end of the fryer. Yet another object of the invention is to provide a fryer of the type described wherein the product conveyor belt is arranged with a return run outside of the fryer pan and with an oil return sump positioned proximate to the product discharge end of the fryer. Another object of the invention is to provide an improved breaded products fryer of the type described which is equipped with a product hold-down conveyor super-imposed upon the principal product conveyor. Still another object of the invention is to provide a new and improved continuous process for treating products including a breaded and battered food product by gently flowing cooking oil over the product as the product is conveyed through the frying process, whether the product is fully or partially submerged or completely exposed and not submerged in the cooking oil. Yet another object is to provide an improved process of cooking a breaded and battered food product by supplying a plurality of downwardly flowing curtains of cooking oil flowing upon the food product enrobing it as it moves through the cooking process. In accordance with the foregoing object, it is a further object to provide for a multi-zone frying process wherein cooking oil is applied to the food products at a plurality of locations along the cooking path at preselected oil temperatures, such temperatures being either uniform or following preselected cooking oil temperature curves to more advantageously cook a wide variety of food products. Still another object is to provide a process as described above wherein cooking oil turbulence is materially reduced at the moment of hot cooking oil contact with the cold uncooked product thereby reducing the forces tending to remove coatings from the food product and producing a highly improved cooked product yield and a superior product in which the surface coating is not partially or fully lost, which loss would expose the “meat” and render the finished product inferior in the eyes of the consumer.",

Art Background \n         [0004]    In open chest surgery, and particularly for cardiac surgery, the sternum is split with chest saw and is held open by a retractor. The sternum is a short bone in the middle of the chest to which all of the ribs are attached either directly, or indirectly. The ribs attached to the top of the sternum are shorter than the ribs attached to the bottom of the sternum. Accordingly, when the chest is opened using the retractor, more stress is placed on the shorter upper ribs than the longer lower ribs, as explained in more detail below. Such stress causes various problems including broken ribs. \n         [0005]    Typical prior art retractors, also termed sternal spreading or chest spreading retractors, comprise two elongated meta...",

    "abstract": "It is an object of this invention to provide sterile body implants comprising body derived whole structures having as a major component collagens in the form of extracellular matrix from which has been removed cellular membranes, nucleic acids, lipids, and cytoplasmic components. It is an object of this invention to provide novel body implants from living bodies which can replace and repair body structures and which is non-antigenic to the body. Another object of this invention is to provide improved methods for treating body tissues to enable their reimplantation in the bodies of others to repair and replace selected body structures. Still another object of this invention is to provide an improved method for forming extracellular matrix from structures taken from the body and to provide methods of using such matrix materials in the body. The method of this invention broadly comprises forming a body implant from a body tissue which has been treated with a denaturing detergent to obtain the structure in extracellular matrix form. In the preferred method of treating body tissue to remove cellular membranes, nucleic acids, lipids and cytoplasmic components and form extracellular matrix having as its major component collagens and making the body tissue suitable for use as a body implant, a first non-denaturing detergent is used to remove cytoplasmic cell membranes but not nuclear membranes while preventing degradation of extracellular matrix. A second strong denaturing detergent is then used to dissolve nuclear membranes after which both detergents are removed while maintaining the tissue in sterile form for use as a body implant. Preferably the first detergent is used with a protease inhibitor and may or may not have a DNase added. Thus, the first soaking of the body tissue removes cell membranes and disrupts lipids but also does not allow the proteases present in the cells to digest or destroy collagens present. The DNA can be partially solubilized and partially removed by either natural DNase or added DNase. In a second step preferably after washing away the first detergent, a denaturing detergent is used to unfold proteins remaining and solubilize them and also remove nuclear membranes. The use of a first step soaking with the non-denaturing detergent permits partial hydrolysis and partial removal of DNA from the tissue material so that highly viscous DNA does not interfere with the action of the second detergent. The highly viscous DNA is modified prior to its complete removal in the second detergent step. In subsequent steps, the detergent is removed preferably by extensive washing which can be for several hours or days at room temperature. In a third step, the extracellular matrix formed can be sterilized as with ethylene oxide or irradiation as known and maintained sterile for subsequent use. The whole structures such as carotid arteries that have been treated in accordance with this invention can e lyophilized for subsequent implantation or maintained sterile in a liquid base under conventional conditions. In some cases, glutaraldehyde or other cross-linking treatments can be used as is known for tissue structures. Such cross-linking may be desired in certain implants. It is a feature of this invention that the body implants can retain the biologically relevant histoarchitecture of the tissue which they are replacing or repairing. The body implants retain physical properties such as strength, resiliency, density, insolubility and permeability. The primary structure of the extracellular matrix in a physical form having biologically relevant spatial arrangements retained along with certain collagens and proteins which are important for regulated ingrowth of new cells. Grafts and other tissues can serve as suitable conduits for recellularization when reimplanted in a body and the recellularization occurs in a biologically relevant fashion to obtain an implant which retains many of the natural physical properties of graft or other tissues. When used in grafts, the implants do not show strong thrombogenic interactions with flowing blood except at extremely small diameters (less than 100 micrometers). The body implants of this invention are of cell-free extracellular matrix which contains a significant portion of the original tissue mass retaining physical properties in regard to strength and elasticity and has components which are largely collagens but also comprise glycosaminoglycans and proteins closely associated with collagen such as the basement membrane complex, laminin and fibronectin. In the cell-free extracellular matrix of this invention which is formed from body tissues other than bone and particularly from blood vessels and ligaments, elastin is a major component along with collagens but usually in somewhat lower amounts than collagens. This varies with different tissue types and in certain tissue such as ligaments, resultant extracellular matrix thereof has more elastin than collagen. As used herein, extracellular matrix shall mean such material as described above in this paragraph formed by having been extracted with at least one detergent. DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Natural body tissues from animals and man such as pig, cow, dog, norse and the like can be used as starting materials to form the body implants of the present invention. Minimized antigenic properties can often be obtained when the same species is used for the starting material as to be used for the implanting although as a practical matter, when dealing with implants for man, the species is often other mammals for derivation of the starting material. The starting tissues are preferably the same as the tissues where the materials are going to be implanted. For example, vascular valves can be replaced with vascular valve materials from another body which had been treated according to this invention. Arteries and veins can be used for replacing arteries and veins and the like. Bones and teeth can be used for replacing bones and teeth and skin for replacing skin. However, in many cases, as for example in skin grafts, various high strength tissue materials can be used as the starting material such as pericardium and dura matter which can be used as a skin implant to dress burn wounds and the like. In all cases, the body implants are formed from body tissues obtained upon autopsy or sacrifice without prior fixation with preservatives, tanning agents or deleterious enzyme treatments. Preferably the tissue to be treated is obtained in a fresh state and treated immediately in accordance with the methods of this invention. Basically detergents are used to remove cellular components from tissues not previously altered by treatment with enzymes, fixatives, protein denaturants, cross-linking agents, sterilants and the like. After treatment of the tissue with detergents, additional steps are taken to remove detergent residues, obtain a sterilized implant which can be maintained sterile and in some cases adding improved physical properties to the implant such as cross-linking for increased strength in certain tissue types. The body implants fall into four general types which includes vascular prostheses such as carotid artery replacement, and general vein and artery replacement in the body, heart valves and patches, burn dressings and coverings, and tooth and bone implants. Preferred body implants include vascular prostheses from explanted human arteries and human umbilical cords for implantation in humans; arteries and veins from primates, dogs and other animals for implantation in humans; venous prostheses complete with valves from explanted human veins for implantation in humans or from animal veins for implantation in humans. Heart valves can be taken from human autopsy or donor tissue for implantation in humans or the source can be slaughterhouse animal tissue for implantation in humans. Pericardium, pericardial sac, dura mater, omentum, mesentery and conjunctiva from human autopsy donor tissue, or from slaughterhouse animals can be used in surgical reconstruction. Bone pieces, cartilage and ligaments from human autopsy or animal tissue can be used in surgical reconstruction. Tooth implants can be obtained and treated and reimplanted in human teeth sockets to provide prosthetic devices. Skin or gut of animal origin can be used for burn wound dressing. Freshly explanted tissues rich in extracellular matrix such as arteries, veins, umbilical cords, skin, bone, teeth, cartilage, intestinal wall, ligaments, and the like are preferred for use. Other body implants can be formed in accordance with the present invention. The original body tissues and structures used are such that they can be treated with detergents of this invention to obtain materials which have the required non-immunogenicity, non-thrombogenicity and favorable surface characteristics for ordered recellularization. Muscle tissues are not preferred for use. According to the preferred detergent processing method, excised living tissue is preferably soaked with a solution of a non-denaturing detergent such as an aqueous solution of Triton X-100, a trademarked product of Rohm and Haas Company of Philadelphia, Pa. such as a 1% solution with from 0.5 to 20% being acceptable. The purpose of the first soaking detergent is to remove the cellular membrane and proteins by disrupting lipids. The solution is preferably changed at least two or three times and preferably more until clear washings are obtained. This first detergent step is preferably carried out at room temperature with the exchange of soaking detergent preferably changed every hour for the first three to five hours. The temperature can vary greatly and can be from 1° C. to 40° C. with exposures of from a few hours to several days. The pH is preferably held between 6 and 8 but can vary between 4 and 9. In some cases, protease inhibitors are used to prevent degradation of the extracellular matrix and preferably prevent naturally occurring proteases from attacking collagens. In some cases, natural protease inhibitors provide sufficient protection. The protease inhibitors can include collagenase inhibitors such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid in concentrations of from 1 to 25 millimolar, sulfhydryl protease inhibitors such as NEM in concentrations of from 1 to 25 millimolar and serine protease inhibitors such as PMSF in concentrations of from 0.2 to 1 millimolar. The temperature is maintained above the Kraft point of the detergent or temperature at which there is no phase separation. Preferably 1-24 hour periods are used at temperatures of from 10° to 30° C. In some cases DNase can be used along with the first detergent. This allows the DNA present to be solubilized and partially removed by either natural DNase or the added DNase. Even if the DNase is not added, DNA is removed and solubilized. The DNase if added can pass through the nuclear membrane and enter the nucleus. Any DNA remaining after the first detergent treatment step is in a non-viscous form which does not act to restrict diffusion of detergent and proteins remaining in the treated material during a second detergent step.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to golf balls, and more particularly, to a golf ball having improved dimples. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Golf balls generally include a spherical outer surface with a plurality of dimples formed thereon. Conventional dimples are circular depressions that reduce drag and increase lift. These dimples are formed where a dimple wall slopes away from the outer surface of the ball forming the depression. Drag is the air resistance that opposes the golf ball&#39;s flight direction. As the ball travels through the air, the air that surrounds the ball has different velocities and thus, different pressures. The air exerts maximum pressure at a stagnation point on the front of the ball. The air then flows around the surface of the ball with an increased velocity and reduced pressure. At some separation point, the air separates from the surface of the ball and generates a large turbulent flow area behind the ball. This flow area, which is called the wake, has low pressure. The difference between the high pressure in front of the ball and the low pressure behind the ball slows the ball down. This is the primary source of drag for golf balls. The dimples on the golf ball cause a thin boundary layer of air adjacent to the ball&#39;s outer surface to flow in a turbulent manner. Thus, the thin boundary layer is called a turbulent boundary layer. The turbulence energizes the boundary layer and helps move the separation point further backward, so that the layer stays attached further along the ball&#39;s outer surface. As a result, there is a reduction in the area of the wake, an increase in the pressure behind the ball, and a substantial reduction in drag. It is the circumference portion of each dimple, where the dimple wall drops away from the outer surface of the ball, which actually creates the turbulence in the boundary layer. Lift is an upward force on the ball that is created by a difference in pressure between the top of the ball and the bottom of the ball. This difference in pressure is created by a warp in the airflow that results from the ball&#39;s backspin. Due to the backspin, the top of the ball moves with the airflow, which delays the air separation point to a location further backward. Conversely, the bottom of the ball moves against the airflow, which moves the separation point forward. This asymmetrical separation creates an arch in the flow pattern that requires the air that flows over the top of the ball to move faster than the air that flows along the bottom of the ball. As a result, the air above the ball is at a lower pressure than the air underneath the ball. This pressure difference results in the overall force, called lift, which is exerted upwardly on the ball. The circumference portion of each dimple is important in optimizing this flow phenomenon, as well. By using dimples to decrease drag and increase lift, almost every golf ball manufacturer has increased their golf ball flight distances. In order to optimize ball performance, it is desirable to have a large number of dimples, hence a large amount of dimple circumference, which are evenly distributed around the ball. In arranging the dimples, an attempt is made to minimize the space between dimples, because such space does not improve aerodynamic performance of the ball. In practical terms, this usually translates into 300 to 500 circular dimples with a conventional-sized dimple having a diameter that ranges from about 0.120 inches to about 0.180 inches. When compared to one conventional-size dimple, theoretically, an increased number of small dimples will create greater aerodynamic performance by increasing total dimple circumference. However, in reality small dimples are not always very effective in decreasing drag and increasing lift. This results at least in part from the susceptibility of small dimples to paint flooding. Paint flooding occurs when the paint coat on the golf ball fills the small dimples, and consequently decreases the aerodynamic effectiveness of the dimples. On the other hand, a smaller number of large dimples also begin to lose effectiveness. This results from the circumference of one large dimple being less than that of a group of smaller dimples. U.S. Pat. No. 4,787,638 teaches the use of grit blasting to create small craters on the undimpled surface of the ball and on the surface of the dimples. Grit blasting is known to create a rough surface. The rough surface on the land surface of the ball may decrease the aesthetic appearance of the ball. Furthermore, these small craters may be covered by paint flooding. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,059,671, 6,176,793 B1, 5,470,076 and 5,005,838, GB 2,103,939 and WO 00/48687 disclose dimples that have smooth irregular dimple surfaces. These smooth irregular dimple surfaces, however, could not efficiently energize the boundary layer flow over the dimples. One approach for maximizing the aerodynamic performance of golf balls is suggested in U.S. Pat. No. 6,162,136 (“the &#39;136 patent), wherein a preferred solution is to minimize the land surface or undimpled surface of the ball. The &#39;136 patent also discloses that this minimization should be balanced against the durability of the ball. Since as the land surface decreases, the susceptibility of the ball to premature wear and tear by impacts with the golf club increases. Hence, there remains a need in the art for a more aerodynamic and durable golf ball. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a golf ball with improved dimples. The present invention is also directed to a golf ball with improved aerodynamic characteristics. These and other embodiments of the prevent invention are realized by a golf ball comprising a spherical outer land surface and a plurality of dimples formed thereon. The dimples have a plurality of sub-dimples to energize the airflow over the dimpled surface. The undimpled land surface, therefore, may remain robust to prevent premature wear and tear. The sub-dimples may have a myriad of shapes and sizes and may be distributed in any pattern, concentration or location. The sub-dimples may have a concave configuration, convex configuration or a combination thereof. In another aspect of the invention, the dimples may have radiating arms emanating from the center of the dimple or a location proximate the center, or from a hub. Preferably, the radiating arms are evenly distributed throughout the dimple. The radiating arms may have a plurality of shapes. At least some of the radiating arms may selectively protrude into the land surface or undimpled surface of the ball to improve the airflow over the land surface of the ball.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a chemical composition and a method for reducing cholesterol as well accomplishing weight loss in humans, whereby a human ingests the chemical composition in recommended dosages prior to eating a meal, and thereby facilitates the binding of undigested fat to a fibrous agent for rapid elimination from the human body. 2. Description of the Related Art In this day and age, many people&#39;s lifestyles have become less physically active. A natural result of a sedentary lifestyle is the tendency to gain weight. Indeed, it is commonly thought that many people are now over-weight with obesity being a growing problem. Due to this trend, countless efforts have been made to help people control their weight. As a few examples, many have proclaimed to have won the “battle of the bulge” with a specific diet program or a particular exercise program. Others have explored hypnosis and other mechanisms for controlling the appetite of an individual. Still others in the scientific arena have formulated sugar substitutes and are pursuing fat substitutes as methods to reduce the caloric intake of an individual hopefully, without sacrificing the taste of otherwise highly fattening foods. While these efforts are generally capable of aiding many in their fight to lose weight or to maintain a desired weight, many are in general, ineffective or simply not practical. For example, some good meaning souls have tried in earnest to follow a particular diet plan but eventually, fall off the plan lacking will-power to continue for weeks and months at a time. This is equally true of those who try hypnosis and similar weight-loss gimmicks. Finally, some view sugar substitutes as being tasteless or worse, as carrying an intolerable health risk, given that some studies have linked them to carcinogens and/or the formation of brain tumors. It has been appreciated in recent years that the fat content of foods eaten are a major culprit behind human weight gain. For example, regardless of the type of fat present in a food product, fat has the highest caloric value per gram —about 9 calories per gram—of any food group. It is understood that the body tends to store fat for future use, rather than to utilize it immediately, and this factor helps lead to weight-gain. However, in recent years it has been recognized, that there is a connection between the amount of fat stored in the body and the level of cholesterol in the body. A diet high in fat is more likely to result in the development of higher cholesterol levels. As cholesterol has been indicated as a factor in arteriosclerosis or hardening of the arteries, the risk for heart disease and/or a heart attack is elevated when a diet high in fat is followed. Unfortunately, fat also makes many food items more tasty—whether butter on bread, dressings on salads, sour cream on potatoes, or frosting on cake—and are therefore, difficult to eliminate entirely from one&#39;s diet. Thus, fat usually finds its way into the body. Once it does so, a healthy body automatically secretes lipase, an enzyme that accelerates synthesis of fats, i.e., breaking down the fat molecule. The majority of all fats in foods are present in “triglyceride form”, which the body seeks to break down by removing the glycerol molecule from the triglyceride and thereby, release the free fatty acids. Once this occurs, the body is well on its way to absorbing the fat and likely, storing same instead of utilizing it for energy. From the foregoing, it will be understood that there remains an appreciable need in the art for a product which facilitates a person&#39;s efforts to lose weight and/or to control his or her weight and yet which is safe and easy to implement. There remains a need in the art for a product and method which aids a person in losing weight or in maintaining a stable weight, which does not rely exclusively on will power. Any such product or method should not interfere with the taste of foods. Ideally, any such product or method would permit a person to eat the foods that they most like, without being as mindful of fats contained therein. Preferably, such product or method would prevent the body from absorbing the fat in such foods once they have been eaten and further, would aid the body in rapid elimination of the absorbed fats in a safe and comfortable manner. In turn, the rapid elimination of fats subsequent to ingestion and prior to digestion, would have a highly beneficial effect in preventing the build-up or accumulation of harmful cholesterol. The present invention is designed to satisfy the needs in the art and is believed to represent a significant advance in improving a person&#39;s health by reducing harmful cholesterol and concurrently facilitating weight loss by means of the rapid elimination of the fat from the human body. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a novel, chemical composition for ingestion by humans which aids in reducing cholesterol, facilitates weight loss and fosters the maintenance of a stable weight. In particular, when the chemical composition of the present invention is ingested by a human prior to eating a meal, the composition acts to absorb and bind undigested fat to a fibrous agent so as to promote its rapid elimination from the human body. In accordance with this invention, the novel composition is moisture activated such that it remains inert and can be formed into capsules, preferably conveniently sized for ingestion by a human, and will remain inert until it comes into contact with water, bodily fluids or other liquids. The composition comprises a mixture of oat bran generally in an amount of about 83% to 85% by weight, glucosamine HCL generally in an amount of about 6% to 8% by weight, glucomannan generally in an amount of about 5% to 6% by weight, an amount of apple pectin or other fruit or vegetable pectin generally in an amount of about 2% by weight and stearic acid generally in an amount of about 1% to 2% by weight of the composition. Upon contact with moisture, the composition begins to break down and becomes activated. Once activated, the composition acts quickly, usually within 30 seconds to seek and attach itself to undigested fats such as oils and the like, and typically, within about 2 minutes will form a small mass of undigestible fibrous material. Additionally, a method for using the chemical composition is also described, which comprises the steps of forming a capsule of generally about 500 to 700 milligrams containing the chemical composition and having a human ingest at least one to four of these capsules with generally about eight ounces of water generally about fifteen to about twenty minutes before a meal. A primary object of the present invention is to provide a chemical composition and method of treatment which serve as a convenient and effective means for reducing the quantity of fat digested and/or absorbed by the human body, thereby aiding in a significant reduction of harmful cholesterol levels in the body as well as a reduction of cholesterol build-up or deposits in the cardiovascular system. Another primary object of the present invention is to provide a chemical composition which seeks out, attaches and binds undigested fat ingested by a human to a fibrous agent, forming an undigestible mass which can easily and rapidly be eliminated from the human&#39;s body. A feature of the chemical composition according to the present invention is that it is moisture activated and therefore, is inert and can be formed into and stored as conveniently sized capsules until being ingested by a human and activated by coming into contact with bodily secretions whether water or other liquid. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a chemical composition which includes a blend of fibrous material for aiding the human body in rapid elimination of waste. A feature of the present invention, in the form of one 500 milligram capsule, is that it can absorb up to twelve times its own weight or generally about 3 to 6 grams of undigested fats. These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent from the detailed description, which follows.",

    "abstract": "Fat blends which include saturated vegetable fats in combination with polyunsaturated vegetable oils have been noted for dietary and/or cooking use. For example, Choi et al., [24(1) Lipids 45, 1989] describe cholesterol synthesis in rats with the feeding of safflower oil or linseed oil blended with palm olein in purified diets containing 10% fat. Suzuki et al., (Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho JP 01, 262,753 [89,262,753] 19 Oct 1989), describe the use of 40-90% natural palm oil and 60-5% natural vegetable oil in deep frying. Lim et al., [39(12) Yukagaku 1045, 1990] describe the increased oxidative stability of soybean oil blended with crude or refined palm oil or refined palm kernel oil. Murakami et al., [41(3) Yukagahu 196, 1992] describe the feeding of soybean oil blended with an equal weight of palm stearin in diets containing 20% fat in which cholesterol metabolism was monitored in rats. Kajimoto et al., [44(6) Nippon Eiyo, Shokuryo Gakkaishi 499, 1991] describe the blending of soybean oil or rapeseed oil with palm oil, and the blending of soybean oil, rapeseed oil and palm oil to enhance the oxidative stabilities of the polyunsaturated oils. Han et al., [23(4) Han&#39; guk Sikp&#39;um Kwahakhoechi 465, 1991] describe the stabilization of soybean oil against thermal and oxidative degradation by blending with an equal or greater proportion of palm oil. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Applicant has determined that in the consumption of dietary fat (as natural triglycerides) it is important to maintain a specific ratio of saturated fatty acids to polyunsaturated fatty acids (at least 0.5:1 but less than 2:1) in the absence of cholesterol. Particularly, it is useful to ingest palm oil, palm olein or its equivalent as the source of the saturated fatty acid. Thus, the present invention relates to the dietary use of a cholesterol-free composition and mixture of two or more vegetable fats and/or oils, in which a balanced proportion of at least one saturated fatty acid such as palmitic acid, is provided together with an approximately equal proportion of at least one polyunsaturated fatty acid such as linoleic acid in the dietary fat. Such a composition will increase HDL cholesterol and increase the HDL/LDL ratio (or decrease the LDL/HDL ratio) in the serum of mammals including humans and other primates. According to the present invention, a method is described for increasing the HDL/LDL ratio in human serum in which the HDL concentration increases while the LDL concentration remains essentially constant or decreases. Accordingly, when daily injested fat in the human diet is provided at a level such that it accounts for approximately 30% of the total dietary energy (as currently recommended by the nutritional research community), the saturated fatty acids including palmitic acid, or lauric and myristic acid must constitute between 20% and 40% by weight of the daily dietary fat, and the polyunsaturated fatty acids including linoleic acid must constitute between 15% and 40% by weight of this fat to maximize the serum HDL/LDL ratio. As one example, a cholesterol-free natural triglyceride fat blend containing equal proportions of approximately 30% by weight palmitic acid and 30% by weight linoleic acid plus linolenic acid is useful in the present invention. For this invention to be completely effective, it is important that certain cholesterolemic components be substantially absent from the diet. These components include but are not limited to dietary cholesterol and trans fatty acids, e.g., triglycerides containing elaidic acid produced during partial hydrogenation of vegetable oils. Illustrating this point with a human nutritional study, Sundram et al. (9 FASEB J. 000, 1995, Abstr.) have shown that exchanging trans 18:1 [elaidic acid] for cis 18:1 [oleic acid] caused a large increase in LDL and a decrease in HDL (where trans and cis 18:1 represented respectively, 7% and 16% of the dietary energy). This result and effect is opposite to the desired effect of the present invention. Applicant has determined that a moderate proportion of saturated fatty acids is beneficial for increasing the HDL/LDL ratio in human serum and that a large proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids in the dietary fat may, surprisingly, be undesirable in depressing this ratio. Such advantages are achieved when the diet is essentially free of trans fats (e.g., elaidic) and represents the actual profile of fatty acid intake of the human. Thus, in a first aspect, the invention features a method of increasing the HDL concentration and the HDL/LDL concentration ratio in human serum. This is achieved by providing a balance between a sufficient and required proportion of cholesterol-free saturated fatty acids in the daily dietary fat of a human, and a sufficient and required, but not excessive proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids including linoleic acid in dietary fat. The remaining proportion of fatty acids and energy from dietary fat is provided by monounsaturated fatty acids including oleic acid. This means that the saturated fatty acids must constitute between 20% and 40% by weight of the daily dietary fat (based upon dietary fat accounting for 30% of the total dietary energy consumption). It also means that linoleic acid must constitute between 15% and 40% by weight of this dietary fat. These constituents will provide the required proportional intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids and thereby enhance the formation of HDL from VLDL and/or decrease the clearance of HDL. An excessive proportional intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids is also avoided in such a formulation to assure a sufficient dietary availability of saturated fatty acids which are required for sufficient VLDL synthesis and HDL production. In preferred embodiments, the cholesterol-free saturated fatty acids include palmitic acid, lauric acid and myristic acid; the proportion of monounsaturated fatty acids in the daily dietary fat is between 20% and 50% oleic acid and no greater than 1% elaidic acid (or other unnatural trans fatty acids) by weight; the polyunsaturated fatty acids include linoleic acid and at least one other polyunsaturated fatty acid selected from the group including α-linolenic acid, eicosapentenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexenoic acid (DHA); and the proportion of saturated fatty acids in the daily dietary fat is at least 20% by weight and dietary fat has less than 5% by weight stearic acid. In a second related aspect, the invention features a method of stabilizing or decreasing the LDL concentration in human serum by providing saturated fatty acids in the daily diet in a proportion between 20% and 40% by weight of the daily dietary fat (based upon dietary fat accounting for 30% of the total dietary energy consumption), and maintaining a proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (including linoleic acid) in the daily diet at the expense of monounsaturated fatty acids (including oleic acid and/or elaidic acid). The linoleic acid constitutes between 15% and 40% by weight of dietary fat. Removal of plasma VLDL remnants and LDL is maximized by this formulation, and the production of LDL is reduced. In a third related aspect, the invention features a method of increasing the HDL and stabilizing or decreasing the LDL concentration in human serum by providing saturated fatty acids in the daily diet in a proportion between 20% and 40% by weight of the daily dietary fat (based upon dietary fat accounting for 30% of the total dietary energy consumption), whereby the production of VLDL, as the HDL precursor, is adequately sustained and is not limiting in HDL biosynthesis. In addition, the method includes maintaining a proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acids (including linoleic acid) in the daily diet at the expense of monounsaturated fatty acids (including oleic acid and/or elaidic acid), wherein linoleic acid constitutes between 15% and 40% by weight of dietary fat, whereby VLDL catabolism to HDL is facilitated and hepatic clearance of VLDL remnants and LDL is enhanced. In a fourth related aspect, the invention features a method of increasing the HDL concentration and the HDL/LDL concentration ratio in human serum by the dietary consumption of foods prepared using a cholesterol-free blended fat composition containing a ratio of one part by weight polyunsaturated fatty acids to at least one part by weight saturated fatty acids. The blended fat composition includes linoleic acid and at least one saturated fatty acid selected from the group including lauric acid, myristic acid, and palmitic acid. The linoleic acid constitutes between 15% by weight and 40% by weight of the composition and saturated fatty acid constitutes between 20% and 40% by weight of the composition. In this way, adequate dietary levels of saturated fatty acids in the absence of cholesterol stimulate VLDL synthesis and secretion by the liver, and adequate dietary levels of linoleic acid enhance LPL activity and generation of HDL from VLDL while stimulating tile removal of VLDL remnants and LDL, and concommitently decreasing CETP activity and HDL catabolism. In preferred embodiments of the above aspects, the foodsource of saturated fatty acids includes at least one vegetable fat selected from the group including palm fat, coconut fat and cocoa butter; the palm fat is selected from the group including palm oil, palm olein, and palm kernel oil; the food source of polyunsaturated fatty acids includes at least one vegetable oil selected from the group including corn oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, soybean oil, cottonseed oil, canola oil, and peanut oil; the polyunsaturated fatty acids include linoleic acid and linolenic acid; wherein linolenic acid is contributed by soybean oil, canola oil, edible flax seed oil, and/or perrilla seed oil; within the blended fat composition is provided a proportion of at least one part by weight cholesterol-free saturated fat to one part by weight polyunsaturated fat to stabilize the polyunsaturated fat against oxidation; the oxidation-resistance of the blended fat composition upon heating to a temperature of 100° C. or greater in air is increased by at least 20% compared to the oxidation resistance of the polyunsaturated fat component when heated separately from the blended fat composition; essentially all of dietary fat is provided in a nutritionally balanced liquid and/or solid formula diet in which dietary fat accounts for between 15% and 458 of the total dietary energy consumption; the dietary fat accounts for between 208% and 30% of the total dietary energy consumption; the compositions noted above are used in place of dietary consumption of foods prepared using a blended fat composition, that is, such foods are substituted with the dietary consumption of a nutritionally balanced liquid formula diet prepared using a blended fat composition in which the total fat content therein accounts for between 15% and 45% of the total dietary energy consumption; daily dietary fat or foods contain a blended fat composition including one part by weight of at least one polyunsaturated vegetable oil selected from the group including corn oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, soybean oil, cottonseed oil, canola oil, and peanut oil blended with at least one part by weight of vegetable fat including saturated fatty acids; the vegetable fat is selected from the group including palm fat, coconut fat and cocoa butter; and the palm fat is selected from the group including palm oil, palm olein, and palm kernel oil. In a fourth related aspect, the invention features a method of increasing the HDL concentration and the HDL/LDL concentration ratio in human serum by the dietary consumption of foods. These foods are prepared using at least one modified fat selected from the group including a chemically interesterified fat, an enzymatically interesterified fat, and a synthetic fat. The modified fat includes one part by weight polyunsaturated fatty acids and at least one part by weight saturated fatty acids selected from the group including lauric acid, myristic acid, and palmitic acid. The polyunsaturated fatty acids constitute between 15% by weight and 40% by weight of modified fat, and the saturated fatty acids constitute between 20% and 40% by weight of modified fat. In this way adequate dietary levels of saturated fatty acids in the absence of cholesterol stimulate VLDL synthesis and secretion by the liver, and adequate dietary levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids enhance LPL activity and generation of HDL from VLDL while stimulating the removal of VLDL remnants and LDL and concommitently decreasing CETP activity and HDL catabolism (FIG. 1). Preferably, the weight ratio of saturated fatty acids to polyunsaturated fatty acids included in dietary fat, modified fat, or blended fat composition ranges from 0.5: 1.0 to 2.0: 1.0; and the weight ratio is approximately (±20) 1 to 1. In a fifth related aspect, the invention features a liquid and/or solid dietary composition suitable for human or animal ingestion for increasing the HDL concentration and the HDL/LDL concentration ratio in the blood serum. Essentially all of dietary fat which accounts for between 15% and 45% of the total dietary energy in liquid formula diet, is provided by a blended fat composition containing one part by weight polyunsaturated fat and at least one part by weight cholesterol-free saturated fat. The blended fat composition includes linoleic acid and at least one saturated fatty acid selected from the group including lauric acid, myristic acid, and palmitic acid. The linoleic acid constitutes between 15% by weight and 40% by weight of the composition, and saturated fatty acid constitutes between 20% and 40% by weight of composition. In preferred embodiments, dietary fat accounts for between 20% and 30% of the total dietary energy in the liquid formula diet; the saturated fatty acid is predominantly palmitic acid; and a reduction in cardiac arrythmia accompanies the increase in HDL concentration and the increase in HDL/LDL concentration ratio. Suitable sources for cholesterol-free fats containing saturated fatty acids include saturated vegetable fats such as palm fat, coconut fat, and cocoa butter. Palm oil, palm olein, and palm kernel oil are particularly useful sources for the saturated fatty acids. Suitable sources for polyunsaturated fatty acids include the vegetable oils which are rich in linoleic acid such as corn oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, soybean oil, and cottonseed oil for example. The above-mentioned vegetable fats and oils can be blended in appropriate ratios according to the content of the above-mentioned saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids therein, to produce dietary fat blends having the recommended proportions by weight of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids (see Tables I and II for the fatty acid content of various vegetable fats and oils as derived from published data [Agriculture Handbook No. 8-4, U.S.D.A. Science and Education Administration, Composition of Foods: Fats and Oils]).",
    "full_text": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n     This invention relates to fat blends and methods for their manufacture and use in foods to stabilize or lower the low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL or LDL-C) concentration and increase the high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL or HDL-C) concentration in human serum. \n     Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the major cause of death in the USA and other affluent nations. Plasma cholesterol, more specifically the LDL/HDL ratio, is highly correlated with risk of CHD as documented by Willett and Sacks, 324 N. Eng. J. Med. 121, 1991. The accumulation of LDL in the arterial intima is thought to lead to its oxidation, which in turn results in cascading events that induce arterial occlusion and thrombosis. High concentrations of HDL appear to block LDL oxidation and reduce the atherogenic potential of LDL. Thus, dietary means which decrease the LDL/HDL ratio (or increase the HDL/LDL ratio), especially means which would increase HDL, are desirable. Perlm...",

    "abstract": "The present invention is a dynamic splint for supporting and actively and passively mobilizing the ankle joint, while accommodating any joint component movements. The mechanism may be utilized to apply a selected force in a gradual and continuous manner or in a discrete and cyclical manner. The mechanism operates on the heel, and is adjustable for either flexing or extending of the heel as desired. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the patient&#39;s heel is placed in a heel cup. The heel cup is attached to a ball and socket joint. The ball and socket joint, in turn is attached to a force-applying element such as a spring-filled cylinder arrangement. The cylinder arrangement is attached to the lower leg with a releasable leg cuff or equivalent attachment means. In operation the spring-filled cylinder exerts a continuous passive force between the lower leg and the calcaneus. The direction of this force urges the heel either upward or downward, depending on the configuration of the spring-filled cylinder for the chosen mode of operation, in order to cause dorsiflexion or plantarflexion along with ancillary component movements. The ball and socket joint which carries the force between the lower leg portion and the heel portion of the apparatus allows the heel and therefore the entire foot to move in the path of least resistance in order to allow normal articulation to occur at the individual joint surfaces. By placing the force-applying mechanism behind the foot and applying the force to the ankle through a heel cup, the mechanism achieves a mechanical advantage to lever the heel to overcome the gastroc/soleus muscle. The invention can also be utilized to brace the ankle joint to allow the patient to put weight on the foot and allow a predetermined extent of mobility of the joint, but not to the extent causing pain or trauma. It can also be used to hold the joint in a desired position, such holding the calcaneus in a downward position to allow the patient to walk and swing the foot without striking the toes. In another embodiment of the invention, the force applied by the spring-filled cylinder between the lower leg and the heel may be cycled in a selected manner to cause repeated and controlled flexing and extending of the ankle joint. The cycling may be accomplished with a suitable drive means such as a programmable stepper motor engaged with a threaded shaft and a microswitch or potentiameter to reverse the direction at desired levels of flexing and extending.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to a urine sampler for use in conducting urinalysis at schools, hospitals, test centers and the like. 2. Description of the Prior Art Urinalysis, a test that can provide important information for early detection of diseases of the internal organs and otherwise determining the state of the subject&#39;s health, can be conducted with no discomfort to the subject and with minimal trouble to those conducting the test. This has led hospitals and test centers to routinely test the urine of large numbers of new patients, persons having medical checkups, hospitalized patients and others. Ordinarily, the subject goes to a toilet to collect a urine sample in a paper cup and then either places the cup on a designated shelf in a lavatory or dips a test paper into the urine and places only the wetted test paper at a designated place. After a prescribed number of the paper cups containing the samples have been collected from the designated lavatories etc. and brought to the laboratory, the samples are analyzed. This conventional method of analyzing urine samples collected in paper cups has a number of drawbacks. One is that some people have difficulty getting the urine into the paper cup. This is particularly true of female and elderly persons, who frequently also get urine on their hands and clothing. The method thus has a sanitation problem. In addition, much care is required in handling the collected samples because there is a danger of tipping over the cup when immersing a test paper in the urine or of spilling urine from the cup when carrying it to the designated place. When, as is frequently the case, a large number of urine samples are tested throughout the day, the wide-mouthed cups, which have to be placed side by side, take up considerable space so that a fairly large area has to be reserved for storing them until the time of testing. There is also a danger of losing all or part of the contents of some of the cups by dropping or tilting them at the time of moving them to the laboratory. This not only fouls the surroundings but may make it impossible to test some samples. Another problem is that many subjects collect larger samples than necessary. As a result, when the samples of a large number of subjects are brought together, they produce a pungent odor which may distract and lower the working efficiency of the doctors, nurses and other personnel who conduct the urinalysis. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of this invention is to provide a compact urine sampler which is extremely easy to use for collecting a urine sample of the minimum required quantity and which enables the collected sample to be safely transferred, without spilling, to a sealed container. For achieving this object, one aspect of the invention provides a urine sampler having a stick-shaped main body constituting a urine collection device. The stick-shaped main body is a cylindrical stick closed at least at one end and having a plurality of urine collection apertures formed in the wall thereof. Another aspect of the invention provides a urine sampler comprising a urine collector and a urine storage capsule, wherein the urine collector has a long rod-shaped handle, a conical urine collection member constituted continuously with the handle and provided with urine collection apertures and a urine accumulator constituted continuously with the base of the urine collection member, and the urine storage capsule has a cutter for cutting a portion of the urine collector, a urine container for receiving urine flowing in from the urine collector and a lid. With the urine sampler according to either of these aspects of the invention, when urine is passed onto the urine collection apertures of the stick-shaped main body or the urine collection apertures of the urine collector, the minimum required amount of urine passes through the urine collection apertures to be stored inside the stick-shaped main body or in the urine accumulator. By holding the urine sampler by the long rod-shaped handle and urinating onto the urine collection apertures, the user can easily cause a urine sample of the minimum required volume to be collected through the urine collection apertures into the urine accumulator. Moreover, in the arrangement in which the urine collector and the urine storage capsule are separately constituted, after urine has been collected in the urine accumulator, the accumulated urine can be transferred to the urine container by forcing the cutter of the urine container onto the bottom of the urine accumulator so as to pierce the bottom of the urine collector and allow the urine to flow from the urine accumulator into the urine container. Then once the urine container has been tightly closed with the lid, the urine storage capsule can be carried or transported standing upright with the collected urine stored therein.",

These properties are furnished by the extracellular matrix composed of collagen types II and other minor collagen components and a high content of the proteoglycan aggrecan. In general, the fibrillar collagenous network resists tensile and shear forces while the highly charged aggrecan resists compression and interstitial fluid flow. The low friction properties are the result of a special molecular composition of the articular surface and of the synovial fluid as well as exudation of interstitial fluid during loading onto the articular surface (Ateshian, 1997; Higaki et al., 1997; Schwartz and Hills, 1998). Articular cartilage is formed during the development of long bones following the condensation of prechondrocytic mesenchymal cells and induction of a phenotype switch from predominantly collagen type I to collagen type II and aggrecan (Hall, 1983; Pechak et al., 1986). Bone is formed from cartilage when chondrocytes hypertrophy and switch to type X collagen expression, accompanied by blood vessel invasion, matrix calcification, the appearance of osteoblasts and bone matrix production. In the adult, a thin layer of articular cartilage remains on the ends of bones and is sustained by chondrocytes through synthesis, assembly and turnover of extracellular matrix (Kuettner, 1992). Articular cartilage disease arises when fractures occur due to physical trauma or when a more gradual erosion, as is characteristic of many forms of arthritis, exposes subchondral bone to create symptomatic joint pain (McCarty and Koopman, 1993). In addition to articular cartilage, cartilaginous tissues remain in the adult at several body sites such as the ears and nose, areas that are often subject to reconstructive surgery. 2) Cartilage Repair: The Natural Response Articular cartilage has a limited response to injury in the adult mainly due to a lack of vascularisation and the presence of a dense proteoglycan rich extracellular matrix (Newman, 1998; Buckwalter and Mankin, 1997; Minas and Nehrer, 1997). The former inhibits the appearance of inflammatory and pluripotential repair cells, while the latter emprisons resident chondrocytes in a matrix non-conducive to migration. However, lesions that penetrate the subchondral bone create a conduit to the highly vascular bone allowing for the formation of a fibrin clot that traps cells of bone and marrow origin in the lesion leading to a granulation tissue. The deeper portions of the granulation tissue reconstitute the subchondral bone plate while the upper portion transforms into a fibrocartilagenous repair tissue. This tissue can temporarily possess the histological appearance of hyaline cartilage although not its mechanical properties (Wei et al., 1997) and is therefore unable to withstand the local mechanical environment leading to the appearance of degeneration before the end of the first year post-injury. Thus the natural response to repair in adult articular cartilage is that partial thickness lesions have no repair response (other than cartilage flow and localized chondrocyte cloning) while full-thickness lesions with bone penetration display a limited and failed response. Age, however, is an important factor since full thickness lesions in immature articular cartilage heal better than in the adult (DePalma et al., 1966; Wei et al., 1997) and superficial lacerations in fetal articular cartilage heal completely in one month without any involvement of vasculature or bone-derived cells (Namba et al., 1998). 3) Current Approaches for Assisted Cartilage Repair Current clinical treatments for symptomatic cartilage defects involve techniques aimed at: 1) removing surface irregularities by shaving and debridement 2) penetration of subchondral bone by drilling, fracturing or abrasion to augment the natural repair response described above (i.e. the family of bone-marrow stimulation techniques) 3) joint realignment or osteotomy to use remaining cartilage for articulation 4) pharmacological modulation 5) tissue transplantation and 6) cell transplantation (Newman, 1998; Buckwalter and Mankin, 1997). Most of these methods have been shown to have some short term benefit in reducing symptoms (months to a few years), while none have been able to consistently demonstrate successful repair of articular lesions after the first few years. The bone marrow-stimulation techniques of shaving, debridement, drilling, fracturing and abrasion athroplasty permit temporary relief from symptoms but produce a sub-functional fibrocartilagenous tissue that is eventually degraded. Pharmacological modulation supplying growth factors to defect sites can augment natural repair but to date insufficiently so (Hunziker and Rosenberg, 1996; Sellers et al., 1997). Allograft and autograft osteochondral tissue transplants containing viable chondrocytes can effect a more successful repair but suffer from severe donor limitations (Mahomed et al., 1992; Outerbridge et al., 1995). 4) Bone-Marrow Stimulation The family of bone marrow-stimulation techniques include debridement, shaving, drilling, microfracturing and abrasion arthroplasty. They are currently used extensively in orthopaedic clinical practice for the treatment of focal lesions of articular cartilage that are full-thickness, i.e. reaching the subchondral bone, and are limited in size, typically less than 3 cm 2  in area. Use of these procedures was initiated by Pridie and others (Pridie, 1959; Insall, 1967; DePalma et al., 1966) who reasoned that a blood clot could be formed in the region of an articular cartilage lesion by violating the cartilage/bone interface to induce bleeding from the bone into the cartilage defect that is avascular. This hematoma could then initiate the classical cascade of wound healing events that leads to successful healing or at least scarring in wounds of vascularized tissues (Clark, 1996). Variations of the Pridie drilling technique were proposed later including abrasion arthroplasty (Childers and Ellwood, 1979; Johnson, 1991) and microfracturing (Rodrigo et al., 1993; Steadman et al., 1997). Abrasion arthroplasty uses motorised instruments to grind away abnormally dense subchondral bone to reach a blood supply in the softer deeper bone. The microfracture technique uses a pick, or an awl, to pierce the subchondral bone plate deep enough (typically 3–4 mm), again to reach a vascular supply and create a blood clot inside the cartilage lesion. Practitioners of the microfracture technique claim to observe a higher success rate than drilling due to the lack of any heat-induced necrosis and less biomechanical destabilisation of the subchondral bone plate with numerous smaller fracture holes rather than large gaps in the plate producing by drilling (Steadman et al., 1998). Yet another related technique for treating focal lesions of articular cartilage is mosaicplasty or osteochondral autograft transplantation (OATS) where cartilage/bone cylinders are transferred from a peripheral “unused” region of a joint to the highly loaded region containing the cartilage lesion (Hangody et al., 1997). There is no universal consensus among orthopaedists on which type of articular cartilage lesion should receive which type of treatment. There is also a lack of rigorous scientific studies that demonstrate the efficacy of these treatments for particular indications. Thus the choice of treatment for cartilage lesions is largely dependent on the training, inclinations and personal experience of the practitioner. Reasons for this lack of consensus are multifold but include the variability in the type of lesion treated and a variable if not uncontrolled success in the formation of a “good quality” blood clot. Some of the problems associated with forming a good quality blood clot with these procedures are 1) the uncontrolled nature of the bleeding coming from the bone, which never fills up the cartilage lesion entirely 2) platelet mediated clot contraction occurring within minutes of clot formation reduces clot size and could detach it from surrounding cartilage (Cohen et al., 1975) 3) dilution of the bone blood with synovial fluid or circulating arthroscopy fluid and 4) the fibrinolytic or clot dissolving activity of synovial fluid (Mankin, 1974). Some of these issues were the motivation behind some studies where a blood clot was formed ex vivo and then cut to size and packed into a meniscal defect (Arnoczky et al., 1988) or an osteochondral defect (Palette et al., 1992). Something similar to the classical wound healing cascade then ensued to aid healing of the defect. This approach did clearly provide more filling of the defect with repair tissue, however the quality of the repair tissue was generally not acceptable, being predominantly fibrous and mechanically insufficient. Some probable reasons for a less than satisfactory repair tissue with this approach are 1) continued platelet mediated clot contraction 2) the lack of viability of some blood components due to extensive ex vivo manipulation and 3) the solidification of the clot ex vivo which precludes good adhesion to all tissue surfaces surrounding the cartilage defect and limits defect filling. In summary, current clinical procedures practised by orthopaedists for treating focal lesions of articular cartilage mostly depend on the formation of a blood clot within the lesion. However the ability to form a good quality blood clot that fills the lesion and contains all of the appropriate elements for wound healing (platelets, monocytes, fibrin network etc) in a viable state produces inconsistent and often unsatisfactory outcomes. One of the embodiments of the present invention ameliorates this situation by providing a composition and method for delivering these blood borne wound healing elements in a full-volume non-contracting matrix to an articular cartilage lesion. 5) Biomaterials and Growth Factors Several experimental techniques have been proposed to repair cartilage lesions using biomaterials and growth factors, sometimes each alone but often in combination. The analogy with the above-described family of bone-marrow stimulation techniques is clear. The fibrin scaffold of the blood clot could be replaced with a prefabricated biomaterial scaffold and the natural mitogenic and chemotactic factors in the blood clot could be replaced with user-controlled quantities and species of soluble elements such as recombinant growth factors. Examples of this approach include the use of fibrin glues to deliver recombinant proteins such as insulin-like-growth factors (Nixon et al., 1999) and transforming growth factors (Hunziker and Rosenberg, 1996). Other biologics have been combined with generic biomaterials such as polylactic acid (PLA), polyglycolic acid (PGA), collagen matrices and fibrin glues including bone morphogenetic proteins (Sellers et al., 1997; Sellers, 2000; Zhang et al. Patent WO 00/44413, 2000), angiotensin-like peptides (Rodgers and Dizerega, Patent WO 00/02905, 2000), and extracts of bone containing a multiplicity of proteins called bone proteins or BP (Atkinson, Patent WO 00/48550, 2000). In the latter method, BP soaked collagen sponges needed to be held in the cartilage defect using an additional fibrin/thrombin based adhesive, creating a rather complex and difficult to reproduce wound healing environment. Coating the biomaterial with fibronectin or RGD peptides to aid cell adhesion and cell migration has been done (Breckke and Coutts, U.S. Pat. No. 6,005,161, 1999). Some previous methods have combined bone-marrow stimulation with post-surgical injection of growth hormone in the synovial space with limited success (Dunn and Dunn, U.S. Pat. No. 5,368,051, 1994). Specific biomaterials compositions have also been proposed such as mixtures of collagen, chitosan and glycoaminoglycans (Collombel et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,166,187, 1992; Suh et al., Patent WO 99/47286, 1999), a crushed cartilage and bone paste (Stone, U.S. Pat. No. 6,110,209, 2000), a multicomponent collagen-based construct (Pahcence et al., U.S. Pat. No. 6,080,194, 2000) and a curable chemically reactive methacrylate-based resin (Braden et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,468,787, 1995). None of these approaches has reached the clinic due to their inability to overcome some of the following problems 1) lack of retention and adherence of the biomaterial in the cartilage defect 2) lack of sustained release of active forms of these molecules at effective concentrations over prolonged periods of time 3) multiple and uncontrolled biological activities of the delivered molecules 4) cytotoxicity of acidic degradation products of PGA and PLA 5) inappropriate degradation kinetics or immunogencity of the carrier biomaterial and 6) undesirable systemic or ectopic affects (calcification of organs) of the active biologics. The successful implementation of these approaches awaits the solution to some or all of these issues. 6) Cell Transplantation Techniques involving cell transplantation have provoked much recent interest due to their ability to enhance cartilage repair by introducing into articular defects, after ex vivo passaging and manipulation, large numbers of autologous chondrocytes (Grande et al., 1989; Brittberg et al., 1994 and 1996; Breinan et al., 1997), allogenic chondrocytes (Chesterman and Smith, 1968; Bently and Greer, 1971; Green, 1977; Aston and Bently, 1986; Itay et al., 1987; Wakatini et al., 1989; Robinson et al., 1990; Freed et al., 1994; Noguchi et al., 1994; Hendrickson et al., 1994; Kandel et al., 1995; Sams and Nixon, 1995; Specchia et al., 1996; Frankel et al., 1997; Hyc et al. 1997; Kawamura et al., 1998), xenogenic chondrocytes (Homminga et al., 1991), perichondrial cells (Chu et al., 1995; Chu et al., 1997), or autogenic and allogenic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Wakatini et al., 1994; Butnariu-Ephrat, 1996; Caplan et al., 1997; Nevo et al., 1998). The cell transplantation approach possesses some potential advantages over other cartilage repair techniques in that they 1) minimise additional cartilage and bone injury, 2) reduce reliance on donors by ex vivo cell production, 3) could mimic natural biological processes of cartilage development, and 4) may provide tailored cell types to execute better repair. One technique using autologous chondrocytes is in the public domain and is commercially available having been used in several thousand US and Swedish patients www.genzyme.com). In this technique chondrocytes are isolated from a cartilage biopsy of a non-load bearing area, proliferated during several weeks, and re-introduced into the cartilage lesion by injection under a sutured and fibrin-sealed periosteal patch harvested from the patient&#39;s tibia. Knowledge of its efficacy has been questioned (Messner and Gillquist, 1996; Brittberg, 1997; Newman, 1998) and is unfortunately not known due to the lack of completion of an FDA requested controlled and randomised clinical trial. Recent animal studies indicate that the injected passaged autologous chondrocytes contribute very little to the observed healing and that the outcome is similar to that obtained using bone-marrow stimulation (Breinan et al., 1997 and Breinan et al., 2000). Thus the surgical preparation of the defect could be the main factor inducing repair, in this procedure as well. Nonetheless, due to the enormous potential benefit of cell transplantation, a large number of patents have been granted in the past two years to protect aspects of autologous chondrocyte processing (Tubo et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,723,331, 1998; Villeneuve, U.S. Pat. No. 5,866,415, 1999), as well as the use and preparation of adipocytes (Mueller and Thaler, U.S. Pat. No. 5,837,235, 1998; Halvorsen et al., Patent EP 1 077 253, 2001), hematopoeitic precursors (Peterson and Nousek-Goebl, U.S. Pat. No. 6,200,606, 2001), amniotic membrane cells (Sackier, 1997), mesenchymal stem cells (Caplan and Hayneworth, U.S. Pat. No. 5,811,094, 1998; Naughton and Naughton, U.S. Pat. No. 5,785,964, 1998; Naughton and Willoughby, U.S. Pat. No. 5,842,477, 1998; Grande and Lucas, U.S. Pat. No. 5,906,934, 1999; Johnstone and Yoo, U.S. Pat. No. 5,908,784, 1999), and general techniques using chondrocytes/fibroblasts and their progenitors, epithelial cells, adipocytes, placental cells and umbilical cord blood cells (Purchio et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,902,741, 1999), all for use in cartilage repair. 7) The Cell Delivery Problem Cell transplantation for assisted cartilage repair necessarily involves a technique to deliver and retain viable and functional transplanted cells at the site of injury. When cells are grown ex vivo with or without a support matrix, press-fitting may be used by preparing an implant that is slightly larger than the defect and forcing it therein (Aston and Bentley 1986; Wakatini et al., 1989; Freed et al., 1994; Chu et al., 1997; Frankel et al., 1997; Kawamura et al., 1998). Press-fitting necessitates the use of a tissue that is formed ex vivo and thus not optimised for the geometric, physical, and biological factors of the site in which it is implanted. Suturing or tacking the implant can aid retention (Sams and Nixon, 1995) although sutures are known to be an additional injury to the articular surface inducing yet another limited repair process (Breinan et al., 1997). Biological glues have been attempted with limited success (Kandel et al., 1995; Jurgenson et al., 1997). When the implant is not amenable to press fitting, such as with contracting collagen gels or fibrin clots, or when cells alone without a support matrix are implanted, often a sutured patch of periosteum or another similar tissue is used to retain the implant material within the defect site (Grande et al., 1989; Brittberg et al., 1994; Grande et al., 1989; Brittberg et al., 1996; Breinan et al., 1997). Such a technique may benefit from an ability of the periosteum to stimulate cartilage formation (O&#39;Driscoll et al., 1988 and 1994), but suffers again from the introduction of sutures and the complex nature of the operation involving periosteal harvesting and arthrotomy. Cells have also been delivered to deep full thickness defects using a viscous hyaluronic acid solution (Robinson et al., 1990; Butnariu-Ephrat, 1996). As with cell sources for cartilage repair, there are several recently published patents for delivery vehicles in cartilage repair ranging from gel matrices (Griffith et al., 1998; Caplan et al., 1999), to sutures and fibres (Vacanti et al., 1998; Vacanti and Langer, 1998a and 1998b), to screw type devices (Schwartz, 1998), and magnetic systems (Halpern, 1997). Taking together the above, current cell delivery techniques for cartilage repair are clearly not optimal. A desirable cell delivery vehicle would be a polymeric solution loaded with cells which solidifies when injected into the defect site, adheres and fills the defect, and provides a temporary biodegradable scaffold to permit proper cell differentiation and the synthesis and assembly of a dense, mechanically functional articular cartilage extracellular matrix.",

Indwelling catheters may also be used to aspirate fluids such as blood from the patient for diagnostic procedures or to drain fluids for other therapeutic purposes. An indwelling catheter may, for example, include a proximal portion extending outside the skin or inside a pocket under the skin, while a distal tip extends through the body often along a tortuous path to enter a target body structure—e.g., the superior vena cava. To reduce trauma to tissue along this path, indwelling catheters are often made smaller in diameter, resulting in reduced flow rates.

    "abstract": "This invention relates to a catheter having a balloon at its distalmost end, and having means for adjustably controlling the stiffness of the catheter shaft, and more particularly to a convertible-type balloon catheter having stiffener means disposed within the catheter. Balloon catheters are utilized for insertion into the human body into lumens therewithin. The catheters are of necessity made of a flexible plastic extrusion such as polyethelene, polyester or polyamide. Advancement and manipulation of a catheter requires a certain stiffness or pushability of the catheter itself, by the physician, without injuring the patient in which the catheter is placed. A number of approaches have been made, in attempting to provide stiffness to catheters. U.S. Pat. No. 4,964,853 to Sugiyama et al shows a balloon catheter having a braided wire member disposed within the catheter body itself in a mesh-like manner. Mesh is imbedded in the wall of the inner tube. U.S. Pat. No. 4,875,841 to Higgins shows a balloon catheter having a coiled wire arranged within the proximalmost hub, which coiled wire extends in an uncoiled manner within the body of the catheter shaft itself. The coil and the wire itself being co-rotatable so as to provide rotational stiffness to the catheter. U.S. Pat. No. 4,822,345 to Danforth shows a variable stiffener balloon catheter, for percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures. This patent to Danforth shows a method of providing for variable flexibility, by the use of a longitudinally extended balloon arranged along the exterior of the catheter shaft. Pressurization or depressurization of this balloon is effectuated by a syringe, which pressurizably controls the rigidity of the balloon itself. A further embodiment of this concept of Danforth utilizes relatively stiff wires running through channels in the periphery of the catheter, the wires adding the stiffness to the catheter. The preformed catheter assembly shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,738,667 to Galloway discloses a sheath which is slideably mounted over the catheter so as to be moved from the proximal to the distal end, to straighten out the distal end during insertion and removal of the catheter from a body. The catheter assembly shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,737,152 to Alchas shows a stylet or stiffening wire arranged within a lumen connected to the closed distal end of the catheter and also there is a loop on its proximalmost end. The loop is arranged in a rotatable knob to facilitate rotation of the distal end of the catheter while providing stiffness, while the proximal end is turned. U.S. Pat. No. 4,586,923 issued to Gould et al shows a curving tip catheter having a catheter body which includes a sheath of braided wire having a meshlike configuration positioned around the wall of the tubular body to provide tortional stiffness to the body relative to the flexible tip. In an alternative embodiment, a relatively stiff but bendable inner plastic tubing can be inserted within the tubular body to provide tortional stiffness to that body. In a somewhat similar vein, U.S. Pat. No. 4,516,972 to Sampson shows a guiding catheter having a helically wound ribbon of flexible material embedded within the wall of the catheter, so as to provide tortional rigidity and stiffness. In yet a further embellishment on the idea of stiffening a balloon catheter, U.S. Pat. No. 4,448,195 to LeVeen et al shows a reinforced balloon catheter which has a guidewire adapted to be inserted for stretching the catheter when it is inserted into a blood vessel to stiffen the catheter and position it. In an alternative arrangement, a braided shell wire reinforcement is used within the braids, which are placed at the beginning and endings of the thinned portion of the catheter. U.S. Pat. No. 4,033,331 to Guss et al, discloses a contour or stiffening wire slideably disposed within a lumen extending substantially the full length of the catheter. Slight retraction of the stiffening wire from the distal end of the lumen permits catheter to assume a predetermined curvature thereat. It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a catheter having variable stiffness capabilities therewithin. The catheter of the present invention should overcome the problems of the prior art by getting the physician to properly adjust the rigidity or stiffness of the catheter shaft according to the particular situation that warrants it in conjunction with the capability of utilizing the catheter shaft in a convertible manner between a “rapid-exchange” mode and an “over-the-wire” mode. Angioplasty “over-the-wire” balloon catheters are known. Simpson et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,323,071 describes a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) dilatation catheter that is advanced through the vasculature of a patient over a previously inserted guidewire that is threaded through a guidewire lumen that extends the full length of the catheter. “Rapid-exchange” balloon catheters are also known. Bonzel, U.S. Pat. No. 4,762,129 describes a dilatation catheter in which a short sleeve extends through the balloon and is sealed off from the interior of the balloon. The sleeve has a guidewire lumen extending therethrough. A permanently imbedded stabilizing wire, that makes the catheter by itself pushable without the use of a removable stiffener or stylet, extends the entire length of the catheter to the distal end of the balloon. Yock, U.S. Pat. No. 5,061,273 describes a rapid-exchange angioplasty catheter having a short guidewire lumen though greater than 10 cm in length, extending through the balloon and through a portion of the catheter shaft proximal of the balloon. Horzewski et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,748,982 describe a rapid-exchange catheter having, in manufacture, a passage extending through the full length of the catheter. A port is located in the side of the catheter shaft some distance from the distal end of the catheter. A distal portion of the passage extending from this port, through the balloon, functions as a guidewire passage. A slit extends longitudinally from the port in the side of the catheter shaft to a region adjacent the balloon, permitting the guide wire to be removed therethrough. A permanent plug blocks the passage immediately proximal of the port in the side of the catheter shaft. A stainless steel stiffener mandrel that is tapered at its distal end is provided in the portion of the lumen that is proximal of the plug. Crittenden et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,988,356 and Euteneur et al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,171,222, teach catheters capable of both over-the-wire and rapid-exchange modes of operation, but without use of a side port to receive a guidewire. Both of these patents disclose a catheter having a guidewire lumen extending through the full length of the catheter and having a slit extending from a location near the proximal end of the catheter shaft to a distal location located proximal of the balloon. The slit enables a guidewire to be stripped from the catheter shaft through the slit or merged into the slit. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention comprises a balloon catheter having a catheter shaft with at least three lumens extending from the proximal to the distal ends thereof. The first and second lumens may preferably but not necessarily be of cresent shape in cross-section, and the third lumen is of circular cross-section. At least one of the cresent shaped lumens has a stiffening mandrel extending therethrough. In a preferred embodiment, the third lumen has a side opening arranged relatively close yet proximal to the balloon at the distal end of the catheter assembly. The balloon on the distal end of the catheter shaft is in fluid communication with one of the cresent shaped lumens. The first shaped lumen has a closed distalmost end, at the proximal end of the balloon. The third lumen, preferably of circular cross-section, extends from the proximal end of the catheter shaft, and through the balloon, open at its distalmost end at the distal end of the balloon. The third lumen is adapted to receive a guidewire, either through the entire length thereof, or from an opening proximal of the balloon and through to its distalmost end. In a preferred embodiment, a guidewire is adaptable to enter the third “distal” lumen at its opening at the distalmost end of the catheter and extend through that lumen, through the balloon, and exit out the side opening through the sidewall of the catheter, proximal of the balloon. The side “guidewire” opening of the third lumen being disposed through the wall of the catheter shaft at a location which is also proximal to the distal end of the stiffening mandrel in the first cresent shaped lumen. This rapid exchange mode with a guidewire extending partway through may occur with a stiffening stylet disposed within the third lumen, the stylet extending up to a location adjacent the side opening, from the proximal end of the catheter. This same lumen, a portion of which is utilized for the “rapid-exchange” mode, is utilized in its entire length, for the catheter in its “over-the-wire” mode, where a guidewire enters the distal opening of the third “distal” lumen, and exits at the proximal end of the catheter at the proximal end of that third lumen, through a connector or adaptor. The present invention thus comprises a multiple lumen catheter (at least three lumens) having proximal and distal ends, the proximal end having a Y-connector thereat for adaptation of inflation devices or control functions, the distal end comprising an inflatable elongated balloon.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to fishing lures. More particularly, the invention is a snag-resistant fishing lure having a blade member uniquely attached to a weighted jig body to substantially minimize the risk of losing the lure to an underwater snag and to provide an intense vibrating action as movement through water displaces the blade from side to side. The present fishing lure may be configured to dive or to run toward the water surface on retrieval by varying the position on the blade member where the fishing line is attached. 2. Description of the Related Art Losing a fishing lure to a snag is a common risk faced by virtually all sport fishermen. Numerous jigs are designed to create a high degree of snag-resistance by molding fiber or wire “weed-guards” in front of the hook. Weed-guards effectively lessen the number of snags, but at the expense of lessening the chances of hooking a fish when the fish strikes because the wire weed guard interferes with the fish taking the hook. The fish must first bite through the weed guard, and the pressure against the fish&#39;s mouth may be felt by the fish and discourage the fish from taking the hook. In addition to snag-resistance, it is desirable for a fishing jig to include a blade or other feature to create motion, and to reflect light, to give the jig a simulated natural swimming motion resembling a minnow or other food source for the sport fish being sought. While many jigs are designed to attract fish in novel ways, none achieve a controlled vibrating action or address the problem of snagging without the aid of weed-guards in front of the hook point. There is a need for a lure that includes features pertaining to snag avoidance without clumsy weed guards, and which also produces an underwater movement that is attractive to fish. U.S. Pat. No. 5,974,723, issued on Nov. 2, 1999 to J. Taibi, illustrates a weed shielding spinner type fishing lure that incorporates a wire weed guard to prevent snagging of the lure. U.S. Pat. No. 5,857,283, issued Apr. 7, 1997 to J. D. Perrick, discloses a fishing lure including a blade having edges that, beginning at the rear edge and going toward the front edge, first converge then diverge towards a blunt, rounded front point, with a hook dressed with feathers, winding thread or the like attached to a rounded rear edge of the blade. The blade includes a slight bend at the rear edge and a slight bend at the front edge, both bends contributing to causing a more life-like motion in the movements of the lure as it is retrieved. U.S. Pat. No. 2,463,889, issued Mar. 8, 1949 to A. C. Lundemo, describes a fishing lure including an elongated spoon having a flat portion, an intermediate portion and a concave portion. A hook is attached to the concave portion and a staple passes through the intermediate portion for the purpose of connecting to a line. The shape of the elongated spoon causes the lure to move in a sporadic and random fashion, as opposed to a rhythmic pattern. U.S. Pat. No. 2,948,984, issued Aug. 16, 1960 to W. Crawford, discloses a fishing lure including a concave spoon having a weighted plug attached to one end and a hook attached to the other end. The spoon also has two holes centrally and longitudinally aligned for the purpose of attaching the lure to a line. The shape of the spoon causes the lure to vibrate depending on the speed of retrieval, thereby attracting fish. Other related patents pertaining to fishing lures include U.S. Pat. No. 1,910,742, issued May 23, 1933 to E. H. Binns (fishing lure including concave spoon and dressed hook attached); U.S. Pat. No. 2,051,978, issued Aug. 25, 1936 to A. C. Accetta (fishing lure including a concave spoon, hook, and fins); and U.S. Pat. No. 5,113,615, issued May 19, 1992 to A. Drachkovitch (spinning spoon fishing lure, including a blade mounted on a swivel and a flexible shaft having hooks attached). None of the above inventions and patents, taken either singly or in combination, is seen to describe the instant invention as claimed. Thus, a snag-resistant fishing lure solving the aforementioned problems is desired. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The snag-resistant fishing lure comprises a blade member uniquely attached to a weighted jig body to substantially minimize the risk of losing the lure to an underwater snag and to provide an intense vibrating action as movement through water displaces the blade from side to side. The jig itself is a generally conventional jig, comprising a weighted body with a fishing hook extending rearward, and an eyelet extending forward. Such a conventional jig is often made by simply casting the weighted body onto the shank of a fishing hook, with the fishing hook eyelet or a separate eyelet piece extending from the front of the weighted body and the hook portion extending rearward. A centrally aligned hole is positioned close to the front edge of the blade member. The jig eyelet is attached to the blade member through the hole with the hook facing upward. The size of the hole and the proximity of the jig&#39;s weighted head to the flat edge keep the hook facing upward, even upon contact with an underwater obstacle. Additionally, the blade is limited in its side-to-side movement by contact between the blade edge and either the jig body or the eyelet. The limited side-to-side movement of the blade creates a quick, controlled, oscillating blade action that imparts a natural swimming motion to the lure, emulating prey species movements. The snag-resistant fishing lure&#39;s blade and weighted jig configuration prevents the hook from rolling downward toward potential snagging obstacles on the bottom. The jig hook is maintained in an upright position by the blade during retrieval. In a conventional jig, the head of the jig tends to hit an underwater obstruction first, causing the hook to rotate and snag the obstruction. With the present invention, the hook pivots upward when the jig&#39;s head contacts a snag because of the unique coupling mechanism between the blade and the jig. It is not allowed to roll because of the blade&#39;s elongated front edge and the proximity of the jig body to the front edge of the blade. Such features greatly reduce the chances of snagging.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to compositions for topical application to the skin which comprise 1-aroyl-N-(2-oxo-3-piperidinyl)-2-piperazine carboxamides and the use of such compositions to provide benefits to the skin. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The desmogleins are a family of transmembrane proteins which play an important role in cell adhesion, ensuring that cells within tissue are bound together. In skin, they are major components in desmosomes. Desmosomes are cell-cell adhesion complex between epithelial and certain other cell types. They provide mechanical integrity to keratinocytes by linking to keratin intermediate filaments. Desmogleins form the glue that attaches adjacent skin cells, keeping the skin intact. Desmoglein 1 and 3 are both expressed in stratified squamous epithelia. Desmoglein 1 is dominantly expressed in the differentiated upper layer of epidermis, and Desmoglein 3 is mostly found in basal and suprabasal layers. The differential expression pattern of Desmogleins is important for regulating epidermal functions. Changes of Desmoglein 1 and 3 expression pattern in animal models disrupts keratinocyte proliferation and barrier function of skin. An anticipated benefit for the stimulation of Desmogleins would be an increase in anchoring and adhesion between keratinocytes leading to firmer skin and fewer wrinkles. Collagen is the body&#39;s major structural protein and is composed of three protein chains wound together in a tight triple helix. This unique structure gives collagen a greater tensile strength than steel. Approximately 33 percent of the protein in the body is collagen. This protein supports tissues and organs and connects these structures to bones. In fact, bones are also composed of collagen combined with certain minerals such as calcium and phosphorus. Collagen plays a key role in providing the structural scaffolding surrounding cells that helps to support cell shape and differentiation, similar to how steel rods reinforce a concrete block. The mesh-like collagen network binds cells together and provides the supportive framework or environment in which cells develop and function, and tissues and bones heal. Collagen is created by fibroblasts, which are specialized skin cells located in the dermis. Fibroblasts also produce other skin structural proteins such as elastin (a protein which gives the skin its ability to snap back) and glucosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs make up the ground substance that keeps the dermis hydrated. In order to signal or turn on the production of skin structural proteins, fibroblast cells have specially shaped receptors on their outside membranes that act as binding sites to which signal molecules with a matching shape can fit. When the receptors are bound by the correct combination of signal molecules (called fibroblast growth factors, or FGFs), the fibroblast begins the production of collagen. The stimulation of collagen gives the skin its strength, durability, and smooth, plump appearance. Dermatopontin is a protein component of the extracellular matrix which is located primarily on the surface of the collagen fibers in the skin. Dermatopontin is believed to play important roles in cell-matrix interactions and matrix assembly (collagen fibrillogenesis). Investigation of dermatopontin knockout mice confirm the involvement of dermatopontin in skin elasticity and collagen accumulation, as the elastic modulus of skin was reported to be 57% lower and collagen content was 40% lower in dermatopontin-null mice than in wild-type mice. Takeda et al., “Targeted disruption of dermatopontin causes abnormal collagen fibrillogenesis,”  J. Invest. Dermatol.,  2002 September; 119(3):678-83. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide new compositions and methods for stimulating collagen I, desmogleins, and/or dermatopontin production. It is a further object of the invention to improve the overall appearance of skin, including treating, reversing, and/or preventing signs of aging, such as skin wrinkles, by stimulating collagen I, desmogleins, and/or dermatopontin production with cosmetic compositions comprising effective amounts of 1-aroyl-N-(2-oxo-3-piperidinyl)-2-piperazine carboxamides. The foregoing discussion is presented solely to provide a better understanding of nature of the problems confronting the art and should not be construed in any way as an admission as to prior art nor should the citation of any reference herein be construed as an admission that such reference constitutes “prior art” to the instant application. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the foregoing objectives and others, it has surprisingly been found that 1-aroyl-N-(2-oxo-3-piperidinyl)-2-piperazine carboxamides are potent stimulators of collagen I, desmogleins, and/or dermatopontin production and thus are beneficial agents against various signs of intrinsic aging and photo-aging of skin. In one aspect of the invention, cosmetic compositions are provided for improving the aesthetic appearance of skin comprising, in a cosmetically acceptable vehicle, an effective amount of a collagen I, desmogleins, and/or dermatopontin enhancing 1-aroyl-N-(2-oxo-3-piperidinyl)-2-piperazine carboxamide having the structure of formula I:",

    "abstract": "Proceeding from the state of the art, the object on which the invention is based is to propose an apparatus for the storage and handling of cigarettes, which, by the use of containers for receiving a cigarette stock, has a considerably larger storage capacity and which allows easier handling during the distribution of the stored cigarettes. To achieve this object, the apparatus according to the invention is characterized in that a plurality of storage units (units consisting of a plurality of containers) are received in a container magazine, the storage units being arranged one above the other and, if appropriate, next to one another within the container magazine in the region of at least one vertical conveyor, the storage units being capable of being fed to the filling station in succession and the individual containers of being filled or emptied in succession within the latter. The apparatus according to the invention accordingly proceeds from storage units which each consist of a plurality of containers arranged next to one another. A plurality of storage units of this type are received in a container magazine. The storage units can be integrated fixedly into the container magazine. However, more advantageous is a handling such that the storage units can, as required, be extracted individually and severally from the container magazine or fed to the latter. According to the invention, in the region of the container magazine, the individual containers are filled and/or emptied, preferably in the region of a stationary filling station. The containers of each storage unit are moved in succession into the filling or emptying station. For this purpose, the container magazine is equipped with cross-conveyors which allow the storage units to be transported relative to a filling or emptying member. A further subject of the invention is the design and handling of the containers, specifically individually or as part of a storage unit. According to the invention, to make it easier to fill and/or empty a container, during a filling (or emptying) phase, guide members for the cigarettes can be introduced into the container via an at least partially open side of the latter and can be moved out of the container gradually in conformity with the filling or emptying operation. These guide members are designed, in particular, in such a way that they form, within the container, a funnel-shaped movement cross section for the cigarettes which leads to a lower central extraction orifice. The guide members are arranged in a stationary manner and penetrate into the particular processed container only in the region of the filling or emptying station. A further special feature of the invention relates to measures in connection with the filling and emptying of the containers, namely for the operations for the opening and closing of a filling orifice of a container. This purpose is served, according to the invention, by closing flaps of the container which, when the filling orifice is open, form a lateral limitation of the conveying channel for the cigarettes.

Such is achieved by control of the time of firing of the respective transducer elements. The scan of the ultrasound beam is accomplished by pulsing the ultrasound elements at different relative times to produce each beam (or “line”). Accordingly, as the relative timing of the energizations of the respective transducer elements changes, the azimuth taken by the beam moves in the direction of the scan. Since the focusing of the ultrasound beam occurs through the control of the time of firing of the respective elements, the focus is predetermined at the time of firing of the elements. It is a characteristic of an ultrasound beam, at its focus, that a maximum level of ultrasound pressure is present. This feature is important when a contrast agent is utilized during the ultrasound imaging action. The most widely used contrast agent comprises microbubbles that produce a strong nonlinear response when illuminated by an ultrasound beam. If the ultrasound beam exhibits, at its focus, an acoustic pressure which exceeds a threshold value, the contrast agent microbubbles can be burst. Use of this phenomenon during flow imaging enables a user to determine the time required to re-perfuse a flow region after the contrast agent therein has been destroyed by a high pressure ultrasound beam. In current ultrasound systems, only one transmit focus is typically present per acoustic line or beam. To achieve the benefits of multiple transmit foci along a single scan direction, the prior art has used a “splice mode” wherein multiple acoustic lines are generated along the same azimuth, but with different focal depths as a result of altered timing of energizing pulses to the transducer elements. Data from the multiple co-linear acoustic lines are then combined to form a single composite image line with multiple foci. Other than the splice mode, a sector scan format used by current ultrasound systems produces focus loci which are semicircles that are centered at the apex of the scan. The concentration of acoustic power at the focal point of an ultrasound beam provides a number of benefits. The echo signal-to-noise ratio in a region of interest is generally greater in echo signals received from the beam&#39;s focal point. Greater destruction of a contrast agent is achievable at the beam&#39;s focal point. This is especially useful in harmonic imaging methods that include subtraction of pre and post destruction image data. As stated above, current ultrasound systems exhibit loci of focal points that are positioned along fixed, regular curves, e.g., in a sector scan, the locus of all beam foci are along a semicircle. There are, however, many anatomical features that present irregular outlines which are not aligned with the regular loci of focal points found in current ultrasound systems. For instance, when imaging cardiac walls, it would be desirable to control the loci of the ultrasound beam focal points to track the cardiac walls so as to achieve improved imaging thereof, or when contrast agent is being used, to enable improved its imaging or destruction. Accordingly, due to the variability of anatomical structures, it would be useful to enable the user to define a path over which beam foci would track so as to enable an improved imaging of irregular anatomical structures. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides a method for controlling, in an ultrasound system, the loci of maximum power regions (e.g., focal points) of plural transmit lines of an ultrasound scan. Initially, a region being imaged is displayed and the user superimposes on the display a desired path to be traced by the loci of focal points of a scanned ultrasound beam. Data defining the path is then used to control an ultrasound transducer to produce a sequence of ultrasound beams that scan the region and to adjust the foci of the individual ultrasound beams so that they track the desired path. It is preferred that a graphical input device be used to trace the path of the loci on the display. The invention further enables data derived from the selected loci of maximum power regions to enable adjustment of both power and focal depth of the respective beams.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to an instrument and apparatus for performing vasectomies and more particularly to an instrument which will clamp the vas deferens in two places and simultaneously sever a section of the vas deferens between the clamps. 2. Description of the Prior Art The use of the vasectomy operation to render a male sterile has become increasingly popular. The operation is generally performed as an office procedure under local anesthetic with the patient awake. Many male patients prefer the operation to be performed with only the surgeon present. The procedure as most commonly performed involves locating the vas deferens in the scrotal sac, and elevating the vas by manipulation to a subcutaneous position. A skin incision is made over the vas and a segment of the vas is isolated from the surrounding tissue. Next a pair of hemostats is applied to the vas and the segment therebetween is excised. The cut margins of the vas are then ligated with a nonabsorbable or an absorbable suture, returned to the sac, and the incision sutured closed. When the surgeon is working alone, the handling of the several instruments needed is awkward and time consuming. For example, it is difficult to suture the cut margins while holding and positioning a hemostat. This step must be performed twice for each side. There has been a long felt need for a surgical instrument with which the surgeon could contact the vas, install a pair of ligating clips to the vas, and simultaneously cut the vas between the clips. Thus, the time from making the incision to suturing the incision after the procedure would be greatly shortened. Ideally, such instrument or the operative parts thereof should be disposable. It is known in the art to utilize ligature clips which are installed using special clip applying forceps as shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,434,795 to Mericle. However, these and known similar instruments apply one clip at a time. A pair of clips or cuffs joined by a filament of body implantable material is taught by Bliss in U.S. Pat. No. 3,766,926 for use in performing a vasectomy for the purpose of holding the severed ends of the vas deferens in a spaced relationship such that a reversal of the vasectomy operation could be performed at a later date. Bliss does not teach any specific instrument for applying his prosthesis. Brodsky et al disclose a vasectomy procedure and instrument in U.S. Pat. No. 3,716,056 which assists the surgeon in lifting the vas from the underneath side and out of the scrotum of the patient. However, no provision is made for closing the ends of the severed vas in the Brodsky instrument. Instruments are known for clamping and cutting an umbilical cord. For example, Mattler in U.S. Pat. No. 4,026,294 shows a device for clamping and then cutting an umbilical cord in separate and distinct clamping and cutting steps. However, this instrument is bulky and unsuited for use in performing the vasectomy procedure. Another similar instrument is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 2,524,337 to Whittaker. Whittaker shows a single blade cutter having a scissors like structure with holding clips disposed on either side of the cutter jaws. These clips are adapted to hold a pair of serrated clamps which are temporarily attached to the umbilical cord and the scissors like structure utilized to cut the cord. Neither the size nor the design of the Whittaker device is suitable for use in a vasectomy procedure. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention comprises a forceps like instrument having a pair of opposing jaws having a width on the order of 1 to 2.5 cm. The upper jaw includes a centralized, longitudinal aperture and a ligature clip-holding groove on either side of the aperture. Opposing the upper jaw is a lower jaw having a cutter receiver surface including a pair of longitudinal parallel slots. On either side of the receiver surface is a groove for holding a clip aligned with the grooves in the upper jaw. Projecting from the receiving surface is a smooth, hook-like guide. A pair of lateral stop surfaces is provided to the rear of the upper and lower jaws to restrain closing of the jaws to a preselected distance. As will be understood, the jaws are operated by a pair of spring loaded handles, preferably having a finger hole in each handle. The spring biases the jaws open. The instrument is preferable made from stainless steel or other suitable metal. The aperture in the upper jaw of the instrument is adapted to receive a disposable rectangular cutting block. The cutting block includes a base portion which may be formed from plastic which snugly fits the jaw aperture and has a pair of thin cutting blades mounted at right angles to the block surface and spaced apart about 1 cm. In use, the block is inserted in the upper jaw aperture such that the two cutting blades oppose the slots in the lower jaw receiver surface. A ligature clip is installed in each of the two sets of grooves along the outer edges of the jaws. The clips are required to be implantable and may be formed from stainless steel, titanium or the like. A suitable clip is the Hemoclip® available from Ethicon. Similar clips are available from Weck. Alternatively, clips formed from absorbable material are suitable. To install the clips and the cutting block, the invention includes a jig which is supplied in a sterile package containing forms for holding a pair of clips in the exact spacing required by the instrument. Between the clips, a block is provided which holds the cutter block assembly. A recess in the base of the jig is shaped to confirm to the hook-like guide of the instrument. To load the clips and the cutter block into the jaws of the instrument, the open jaws are placed over the jig and moved downward such that the cutter block slides into the upper jaw slot, the lower jaw guide enters the recess in the jig and the two clips slide into the grooves in the upper and lower jaws. The instrument is withdrawn from the jig and is then ready for use. After the instrument is loaded, the surgeon makes the required incision in the scrotal sac, picks up the vas deferens with the hooked guide of the lower jaw of the instrument, causing the vas to slide into the clips as it lays across the receiving block. When the vas is in the proper position, the surgeon closes the jaws causing the clips to close and clamp the vas and the cutter blades to cut out a 1 to 2.5 cm section of the vas. As will be understood, this procedure can be performed very smoothly and quickly. The jaw stops permit a desired degree of closure of the clips on the vas without crushing the walls thereof. The instrument is then removed and opened with the severed section of the vas captured between the two blades which can be removed for pathology. The cutter assembly is discarded and the instrument may be reloaded for the other side.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to chemicals for controlling plant virus diseases and also to a control method using such chemicals. 2. Description of the Prior Art It is known that the plants such as tobacco, tomato, Spanish paprika, potato, cowpea, French bean, cucumber, water melon, strawberry, melon, Chinese cabbage, radish and the like, which are cultivated in various manners of culture such as fieled culture, glasshouse culture, etc., tend to suffer from mosaic diseases and dwarfing diseases to plant viruses such as a tobacco mosaic virus (hereinlater abbreviated as TMV), cucumber mosaic virus (hereinlater abbreviated as CMV), cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (hereinlater abbreviated as CGMMV), potato virus X (hereinlater abbreviated as PVX), lettuce mosaic virus (hereinlater abbreviated as LMV), melon necrotic spot virus (hereinlater abbreviated as MNSV) and the like, thus frequently incurring a great deal of damage to these plants. Since these plant viruses generally exist in various plants, weeds, seeds, soils, roots remaining in soil, the plant suffers readily contagion to the viruses by the suction of plant juice by the insects, by artificial contact (such as with farm appliances, hand, or clothes), or by the contact with the virus-containing soil during transplantation or planting, etc. If a primary contagion takes place, there is a danger that the plant virus spreads throughout the field or other culture systems by the artificial contact such as the farming work. Various chemicals for controlling such plant virus diseases are known including: antibiotics and base in nucleic acid-like substances both of which have a function of suppressing multiplication of plant viruses; and the juices of plants such as dyer&#39;s grape (Phytaracca decandra), goosefoot, carnation, etc., and polymeric materials derived from living body such as casein, alginic acid, etc both of which have a function of preventing contagion of plant viruses to the plants. However, most of the former substances exhibit toxicity against man and domestic animals as well as plants and thus have never been used in practical application. The latter substances are of natural origin and thus a difficulty is encountered in mass-producing the substances having uniform composition. Only one instance which has been practically used is a chemical containing sodium alginate as a principal component (wettable powder of alginic acid: Registration No. 13440 at the Minister of the Agriculture and Forestry, Japan). Therefore, if a plant has been once infected with a disease in the culture field, the secondary contagion is generally prevented by a passive manner that the infected plants are removed and burnt up as soon as we find. We have made an intensive study to develop an agricultural chemical for controlling plant virus diseases which is innoxious and high in efficacy and, as a result, found that polymers of dialkylaminoalkyl acrylate derivatives or dialkylaminoalkyl methacrylate derivatives show high activity of controlling plant virus diseases. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Thus, an object of the present invention is to provide an agricultural chemical for plant virus control which is innoxious and high in control efficacy. Another object of the invention is to provide a control method using the chemical of the just-mentioned type. According to the present invention, these objects are attained. This invention relates to a chemical for controlling plant virus diseases which containing an effective amount of a homopolymer of a compound expressed by the general formula: ##STR1## (wherein R 1  represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group, R 2  represents a linear or a branched alkylene group containing from 2 to 5 carbon atoms, R 3  and R 4  independently represents a lower alkyl group, R 5  represents a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group, and X represents a halogen atom, an acid radical or a lower alkylsulfuric acid radical) or a copolymer of the compound of formula (I) with at least one copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer, and relates to a control method using the chemical. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, there is used a polymeric substance of the compound having the general formula (I) above described as an effective component to control plant virus diseases. In a compound the general formula (1), R 1  represents a hydrogen atom or a methyl group; R 2  represents a linear or a branched alkylene group containing from 2 to 5 carbon atoms, preferably dimethylene, trimethylene, tetramethylene group or ethylene group having at least one side chain methyl group, such as iso-propyl group, tert-butyl group; R 3  and R 4  may be same or different, represent a lower alkyl group, preferably an alkyl group containing from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, concretely a methyl group, a ethyl group or a propyl group; R 5  represents a hydrogen atom or a lower alkyl group, preferably a hydrogen atom or a alkyl group containing from 1 to 3 carbon atoms, concretely a methyl group, a ethyl group or a propyl group; X represents a halogen atom such as a chlorine atom, a bromine atom and an iodine atom, an inorganic acid radical such as NO 3  and 1/2(SO 4 ), a lower fatty acid radical such as HCOO, CH 3  COO and C 2  H 5  COO or a lower alkyl sulfuric acid radical such as CH 3  SO 4  and C 2  H 5  SO 4 , preferably a chlorine atom, a bromine atom, an iodine atom, an inorganic acid radical, a fatty acid radical containing from 1 to 3 carbon atoms or an alkyl sulfuric acid radical containing from 1 to 3 carbon atoms in the alkyl moiety thereof. In case of R 5  is a hydrogen atom, X is selected from a halogen atom, a inorganic acid radical and a lower fatty acid radical, and in case of R 5  is an alkyl group, X is selected from a halogen atom and a lower alkyl sulfuric acid radical. The following are examples of dialkylaminoalkyl acrylate derivatives or dialkylaminoalkyl methacrylate derivatives according to formula (I), dimethylamino(α-methyl)ethyl methacrylate hydrochloride, dimethylamino(β-dimethyl)ethyl methacrylate acetate, dimethylaminotrimethyl methacrylate sulfate, dimethylammonium (β-dimethyl)ethyl methacrylate methylsulfate, dimethylammonium(β-dimethyl)ethyl methacrylate bromide, diethylammonium(α-methyl)ethyl methacrylate chloride, dimethylammoniumethyl acrylate methylsulfate, dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate hydrochloride. It is known that the compound of formula (I) can be prepared by either quaterizing a compound expressed by the general formula (II) ##STR2## (wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3  and R 4  have the same meanings as defined in the foregoing formula (I), respectively) with an alkyl halide such as methyl chloride, methyl bromide, methyl iodide, ethyl bromide or the like or with an alkylsulfuric acid such as dimethylsulfuric acid or diethylsulfuric acid, or neutralizing the compound of formula (II) with an acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, sulfamic acid or acetic acid. The preparation of the polymer, an effective component of the chemical according to the invention, from the compound of formula (I) is feasible by any of known techniques. For instance, the polymer can be obtained by subjecting to polymerize the compound of formula (I) alone or in combination with at least one copolymerizable ethylenically unsaturated monomer in the manner of a precipitation or a suspension polymerization in the presence of a catalyst for the polymerization. Examples of the ethylenically unsaturated monomers copolymerizable with the compound of formula (I) include nonionic monomers such as lower alkyl esters of unsaturated carboxylic acids, i.e., methylacrylate, ethylacrylate, methylmethacrylate and the like, acrylamide, methacrylamide, vinylpyrrolidone, acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, vinylacetate, vinyl methyl ether, vinyl ethyl ether, ethylene, isobutylene and the like, cationic monomers such as vinyl pyridines, p-dimethylaminomethylstyrene and the like. Of these, acrylamide and methacrylamide are preferred. When a copolymer is used as the effective component of the chemical of the invention, the content of the compound of formula (I) in the copolymer should be within a range of above 10 mol %, preferably above 30 mol %. A polymer and copolymer of this invention are water-soluble or water-suspensible, preferably water-soluble. Therefore, when the ethylenically unsaturated monomers in the copolymer are water-insoluble, the rate of said monomer in a compound limited within a rage of from 1 to 20 mol %. The intrinsic viscosity of polymers may be within a rage of from 0.3 to 15.",

    "abstract": "My invention provides an apparatus which remedies the problem of providing CPAP oxygenation to the non-ventilated lung. Briefly, oxygen flowing at a constant rate (5 L/minute) is connected to the nozzle of a hollow, cylindrical device. The opposite end connects to the lumen of a double-lumen endotracheal tube which in turn leads to a lung which is not being ventilated. A graduated vent opening allows the escape of oxygen under pressure. Pressure within the system ranges from 5 to 10 cm. H 2  O and the oxygen pressure will obviously be transmitted to the lung as well. This gentle and constant pressure will allow some alveoli to be stented open, thereby allowing the blood passing through them to become oxygenated. Typically, less than 1% of the oxygen will flow into the lung while more than 99% escapes through the vent. As the level of CPAP is increased, more and more alveoli become stented open to allow progressive improvements in oxygenation. In this way, situations of critical hypoxemia are remedied. Surgery is able to continue unimpeded because no active ventilation is occurring; that is, the operated lung remains relatively small and constant in size and configuration since no active expansion and contraction occur. A small removable cap is present on the end of the apparatus. When the cap is removed, one can attach an anesthesia bag which will fill with oxygen to the pressure generated within the system. From time to time, it may be helpful to initially open previously closed alveoli by squeezing the bag and transiently generating greater pressure within the system. When the pressure then falls to that set by the apparatus, the now opened alveoli will be kept open by the CPAP generated by the device. In one embodiment of my invention, the CPAP device includes a shorter outer cylinder which is snugly and rotatably disposed on one end of a long hollow inner cylinder. This end of the long inner cylinder is designed to fit onto the proximal end of one lumen of a double-lumen endotracheal tube. The removable cap is inserted in the opposite end of the long inner cylinder. A cylindrical fitting extends from a side portion of the long inner cylinder for attachment to an oxygen tube connected to a source of oxygen delivered at a constant flow rate. Both the inner and outer cylinders have an elongated slot cut in them to form means for continuously venting the oxygen such that, when the cylinders are rotated with respect to each other, the slots cooperate to form a larger or smaller opening to provide for varying degrees of pressure of the oxygen delivered to the single lumen and, in turn, to the non-ventilated lung of a patient during thoracic surgery. The slots are always at least partially in line, so that there is always a means for permitting oxygen to escape the device. In one modification of my invention, the venting means takes the form of a tab slidable in an elongated slot formed in a single hollow cylindrical member in such a manner that there always is some degree of opening of the slot. In another modification, the venting means takes the form of a series of aligned holes provided in a single hollow cylindrical member. Further, a plastic strip having a series of corresponding projections thereon is arranged such that the projections sealingly engage a variable number of the holes but in such a manner that at least one hole always being open. In still another modification, the venting means is similar to that described above, except several individual closure members are employed to close a variable number of holes with at least one hole always being open.",

    "abstract": "The foregoing objects of the invention, along with various features and advantages, are achieved in a basketball goal having a support structure adapted to be mounted to a backboard and a rim structure, including a rim, mounted to said support structure. The rim structure moves relative to the support structure by a rim support assembly including a shock absorber. The rim support assembly moves said rim structure from a horizontal position to a nonhorizontal position upon application of a predetermined force to said rim. The shock absorber minimizes the vibrations that the rim support assembly encounters when the rim structure is in the horizontal position and when the rim structure returns to the horizontal position. In another aspect of the invention the basketball goal further includes a support structure adapted to be mounted to a backboard and a rim structure, including a rim, mounted to the support structure. The basketball goal further includes a rim support assembly including a shaft and a clamp including a mating portion. The clamp has a clamped position engaged with the shaft in the mating portion of the clamp for maintaining the rim in a horizontal position. The clamp further includes an unclamped position wherein the mating portion of the clamp is disengaged from the shaft enabling the rim to swing downwardly in an arcuate path. A coiled spring is operatively mounted to the clamp for maintaining the clamp in the clamped position, and for permitting the clamp to assume the unclamped position and move in the arcuate path upon application of a predetermined force to the rim. There is a rigid member, extending through the spring, having a looped end surrounding the shaft mounted for swinging movement along another arcuate path upon application of the predetermined force, thereby preventing damage to said spring when said clamp assumes said unclamped position. The clamp further includes a pin extending through the clamp enabling the clamp to pivot about the pin when the predetermined force is applied to the rim. An engagement device then is used to engage the pin so that the pin is directed in an opening of the clamp and thus improves the tolerance of the opening. Further aspects of the invention will become apparent upon reading the following detailed description of the exemplary embodiments of the invention in conjunction with the accompanying drawings. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS Exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown in the following drawings wherein: FIG. 1 is side view of an exemplary embodiment of the breakaway basketball rim incorporating the invention; FIG. 2 is a side view of the embodiment shown in FIG. 1 with the rim in a breakaway position inclined from the horizontal; FIG. 3 is a front view of the embodiment shown in FIG. 1; FIG. 4 is a sectional view of the embodiment of FIG. 1, taken along lines 4--4 of FIG. 3; FIG. 5 is a sectional view partially cutaway, of the embodiment of FIG. 1, taken along lines 5--5 thereof; FIG. 6 is a sectional view, partially cutaway, of the embodiment of FIG. 1, taken along lines 6--6 of FIG. 3; FIG. 7 is a sectional view, partially cutaway, of the embodiment of FIG. 1 with the rim in the breakaway position shown in FIG. 2; FIG. 8 is a sectional view of a portion of a pivot assembly for the rim shown in the embodiment of FIG. 1; FIG. 9 is a view of another portion of the mounting assembly for the rim shown in the embodiment of FIG. 1; FIG. 10 is a rear view of an embodiment of the clamp employing bumpers; and FIG. 11 is a side view of the embodiment of the clamp of FIG. 10.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates generally to medical apparatus and methods, more specifically to instrument immobilizers and even more specifically, but not by way of limitation to an apparatus and methods for anchoring an intracranial probe or lead to the cranium. Implanting medical devices within the cranium is an increasingly important approach for treatment of disorders such as Parkinson&#39;s Disease, essential tremor and dystonia. This approach may also be used to treat a wide array of neuropsychiatric problems, such as depression, epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disorder, obesity and chronic pain. Most of these devices interact with the brain by delivering current through an implanted probe to modulate brain activity. In addition, infusion of drugs through a permanently implanted probe has been proposed as a primary treatment, or as an adjunctive treatment to electrical stimulation, for Alzheimer&#39;s and Parkinson&#39;s Diseases, among others. As part of the implant procedure, the probe must be stabilized in the brain. Ideally, any prosthetic device is attached directly to the tissue on which it operates, in this case, the brain. Direct attachment of electrical and chemical probes to brain tissue is impractical. A more easily implementable solution is a system of flexible probes that bend and float with the brain as the brain moves within the cranial cavity. Such probes are secured to the cranium. In this manner, mechanical forces from outside the cranium are prevented from acting on the brain-to-probe interface. There are a number of current techniques for securing a probe to the cranium. For example, in one approach, a permanently implanted probe is fixed by a sliding door which closes to form a slot just wide enough to slightly compress and grip the body of the probe. A common feature of such devices is that they grip the probe somewhere within the craniotomy opening, and that the slot has a fixed orientation relative to the cranium. In another approach, the probe passes through a narrow aperture at the center of a craniotomy opening. The probe is held in place by a surgeon as it is bent over into a slot leading to the exit from the device. Hinged arms swing into place to narrow the slot and anchor the probe within the slot. Current anchoring devices are typically positioned over the craniotomy opening, and they are attached to the cranium with several peripheral screws. An implantable lead is placed through the cranial opening and the lead is gripped by two opposing thin bars. In some cases, it is possible to damage the lead by crushing it between the thin bars. It would therefore be desirable to grip the lead with wider bars to more evenly distribute the gripping force over a greater axial length of the implantable lead. It would also be desirable to provide a more stable mounting for the skull-mounted portion of the anchoring device. Additionally, current devices often have a small opening for receiving the lead and thus it would be desirable to provide an anchoring device having a wider opening for the lead, to permit adjustment of lead position for optimal placement, especially when using a large multi-channel probe array, a feature shared by only a few currently available anchoring systems. 2. Description of the Background Art Prior patents and publications describing anchors for cranial probes include: U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,328,813; 5,464,446; 6,044,304; 2004/0267284; 2005/0192594; and WO 2004/026161. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention generally provides an anchor for securing an implantable lead within tissues in a patient. The terms “lead” and “probe” will be used interchangeably with one another in this disclosure, as will the terms “anchor base” and “cylinder.” Often the lead may comprise an electrode or a catheter, and the lead is often implanted into brain tissue through a craniotomy in the patient&#39;s skull. A current and/or therapeutic agent may be delivered through the lead to the tissue and the anchor is usually composed of materials that are compatible with magnetic resonance imaging. The anchor may be fabricated from metals that do not interfere with MRI and/or polymers such as polyphenylene sulfide, polyetheretherketone (PEEK), polyetherimide, polyimide, polysulfone and the like. In a first aspect of the present invention an apparatus for securing an implantable lead within tissue of a patient comprises a base that is adapted to be secured to a patient&#39;s skull adjacent a craniotomy. The base has an upper surface, a lower surface and a central passage therebetween which is adapted to receive the implantable lead. The apparatus also includes a cover that can be releasably coupled to the base so as to substantially cover the central passage and also to capture the lead therebetween. A first rotating member or door, is coupled with the base and is rotationally movable so as to meet and engage the lead at a plurality of positions within the central passage. Rotating the door also adjusts the position of an opening within the central passage in which the lead may pass through and also closes or reduces the size of the central passage while still allowing the lead to pass therethrough. Often, the first rotating member comprises a removable insert that is adapted to releasably grip the lead and that may be received in a recessed region of the rotating member. The removable insert is usually adapted to be removably coupled to the first rotating member with a rotationally actuated tool that may be coupled to the first rotating member. The first rotating member may have a surface defining a wedge shaped or indented region that is adapted to receive and align the tool. The apparatus may have a pin or rivet engaged with the first rotating member that secures the first rotating member to the base while allowing rotation of the first rotating member relative to the base. The first rotating member may also have a surface that defines a receptacle that is adapted to receive a tool for turning the first rotating member into a desired position so as to engage the lead and fix the lead into a position. The first rotating member may further comprise a resilient end that is adapted to releasably grip the lead. The resilient end may lie in the same plane as the first rotating member and may be composed of an elastomer. The resilient end often is constructed with a substantially solid core while sometimes it may be porous. Often the resilient end comprises surface features that are adapted to capture the lead. The surface features may include a plurality of convex or concave regions adjacent to one another or the surface features may be scallops. Sometimes the surface features may comprise a plurality of resilient fingers that extend outward from the resilient end. The surface features may also comprise combinations thereof. The apparatus may further comprise a ratchet mechanism that is adapted to restrict the first rotating member to motion in one direction. Often the apparatus also comprises a fixing element such as a set screw that is adapted to immobilize the first rotating member. The apparatus also often comprises a second rotating member that is coupled with the base and a spacer may be used to separate the first and second rotating members from one another. The second rotating member is rotationally movable so as to meet and engage the lead at a plurality of positions within the central passage. Rotating the second door also adjusts the position of an opening within the central passage in which the lead may pass through and also closes or reduces the size of the central passage while still allowing the lead to pass therethrough. Usually, the first and second rotating members are movable independently of one another and they may be retained in the base with a retaining member such as a ring. Also, the first and second rotating members may lie in the base adjacent to one another. Sometimes the second rotating member comprises a removable insert that is adapted to releasably grip the lead. The insert on the second rotating member may take the same form as the insert on the first rotating member. Often the resilient end on the first rotating member lies in a plane between the first and second rotating members. The apparatus may further comprise a locking mechanism coupled with the first and second rotating members. The locking mechanism locks the first and second members together thereby preventing relative motion therebetween. The locking mechanism may be a detent and comprise a protuberance on either the first or second rotating member and a receptacle for receiving the protuberance on the other rotating member. These features allow the rotating members to snap into position with one another thereby ensuring the lead is gripped therebetween. Often, the apparatus further comprises one or more tabs that extend radially outward from the base. The tabs are adapted to be secured to the skull adjacent the craniotomy. The tabs often define apertures that can receive a fastener such as a screw, thereby securing the base adjacent the craniotomy. Sometimes the base is cylindrical and may be sized to fit at least partially within the craniotomy, and at least a portion of the base may be securely press fit into the craniotomy. The base may comprise a discrete upper and a discrete lower portion that are fastened together, or the base may be of unitary construction. The base may be recessed at least partially into the craniotomy, or the lower surface of the base may sit substantially flush with the top of the skull. The base may also have one or more receptacles that are adapted to releasably receive at least a portion of the cover. Often, the upper surface of the base defines one or more channels that are sized and shaped to accept the lead after the lead has been disposed therein. The base may also be adapted to receive and retain other surgical instruments such as instrument positioning guides or other reference devices often used during neurosurgery. These other surgical instruments may releasably lock with a flange in the base, a retaining member in the base or any other portion of the base or components therein. Often the cover is adapted to be removably coupled to the base. Sometimes the cover comprises one or more legs that are adapted to releasably snap fit into engagement with the base. Alternatively, the legs may be disposed on the base or on a retaining member that fits in the base. The cover may have a surface that defines one or more channels that are sized and shaped to accept the lead after it has been disposed therein. One or more plugs may be placed into the channels or a gasket may be disposed between the cover and the base in order to seal any gaps therebetween. In another aspect of the present invention, a system for securing an implantable lead within tissue of a patient comprises an apparatus for securing the implantable lead within tissue. The apparatus comprises a base adapted to be secured to a patient&#39;s skull adjacent a craniotomy, the base having an upper and lower surface and a central passage therebetween. The implantable lead is often disposed in the central passage. The apparatus also comprises a first rotating member coupled with the base and having a removable insert adapted to engage the lead. A retaining pin may couple the insert with the first rotating member. The first rotating member is rotationally movable so as to meet and engage the lead at a plurality of positions within the central passage. Rotating the door also adjusts the position of an opening within the central passage in which the lead may pass through and also closes or reduces the size of the central passage while still allowing the lead to pass therethrough. The system also includes a tool having a proximal end, a distal end and a handle, the tool being adapted to introduce and remove the removable insert to or from the first rotating member.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to medical imaging. More particularly, this invention relates to reconstruction of an anatomic structure from relatively sparse data. 2. Description of the Related Art Medical catheterizations are routinely carried out today, for example, in cases of cardiac arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, which occur when regions of cardiac tissue abnormally conduct electric signals to adjacent tissue, thereby disrupting the normal cardiac cycle and causing asynchronous rhythm. Procedures for treating arrhythmia include surgically disrupting the origin of the signals causing the arrhythmia, as well as disrupting the conducting pathway for such signals. By selectively ablating cardiac tissue by application of energy, e.g., radiofrequency energy via a catheter, it is sometimes possible to cease or modify the propagation of unwanted electrical signals from one portion of the heart to another. The ablation process destroys the unwanted electrical pathways by formation of non-conducting lesions. It is desirable in such procedures to provide a convenient representations of the cardiac anatomy to the operator. For example, the left atrium is a complicated 3-dimensional structure, the walls of which have dimensions, which differ from person to person, although all left atria have the same underlying shape. The left atrium can be divided into a number of substructures, such as the pulmonary vein, the mitral or bicuspid valve and the septum, which are conceptually easy to identify. The sub-structures also typically differ from person to person, but as for the overall left atrium, each substructure has the same underlying shape. In addition, a given substructure has the same relationship to the other substructures of the heart, regardless of the individual differences in shapes of the substructures. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A collection of sparse data, known as a “point cloud”, typically associated with a coordinate system, may be produced by imaging systems during a medical catheterization. Disclosed herein are methods and systems for developing a feature-rich 3-dimensional reconstruction of an anatomic structure from a point cloud, e.g., a point cloud obtained from a heart or portion thereof. The point cloud may be relatively sparse. When using a point cloud to reconstruct a 3D model of the heart, there is a question of an appropriate resolution of the reconstruction. A low resolution gives a rough reconstruction but works well with low-density point clouds. A high resolution gives a much more feature rich reconstruction, but is more prone to errors when applied to low density point clouds (holes and disconnected floating elements). This can be overcome by manually setting separate resolutions for separate regions of the reconstruction. However, the manual process is uncomfortable and takes some time. An automatic approach is preferable. There is provided according to embodiments of the invention a method of 3-dimensional cardiac reconstruction, which is carried out by inserting a probe into a heart of a living subject, the probe has a mapping electrode, urging the mapping electrode into contacting relationships with a tissue in plurality of regions of interest of the heart, acquiring electrical data from respective locations in the regions of interest, representing the locations of the electrical data as a point cloud, reconstructing a model of the heart from the point cloud, applying a set of filters to the model to produce a filtered volume, segmenting the filtered volume to define components of the heart, and reporting the segmented filtered volume, wherein at least one of the above steps is implemented in computer hardware or computer software embodied in a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium. In an aspect of the method, reconstructing a model and applying a set of filters are performed iteratively using portions of the point cloud until a stop condition is met. The stop condition may include one of a failure to achieve a progressively higher resolution of the filtered volume in a predetermined number of iterations, an expiration of a preset time interval and a completion of a predetermined number of iterations. According to an additional aspect of the method, applying a set of filters includes applying respective subsets of the set of filters in successive iterations thereof. According to yet another aspect of the method, the subsets are chosen randomly. According to still another aspect of the method, the subsets are chosen according to a search strategy. According to a further aspect of the method, applying a set of filters includes making a determination that the filtered volume has a resolution that exceeds a resolution of the filtered volume of a preceding iteration of applying a set of filters, and responsively to the determination, using the filtered volume as an input to a subsequent iteration of reconstructing a model and applying a set of filters. A further aspect of the method is carried out after segmenting the filtered volume by storing respective instances of the segmented filtered volume, and combining the instances of the segmented filtered volume into a composite volume, and displaying the composite volume. There is further provided according to embodiments of the invention an apparatus for carrying out the above-described method.",

Overtime, this oxygen deprivation ultimately affects the ability to perform daily activities including beneficial exercises which may then lead to other health problems. As such, it is well known that the ability to distribute oxygen to other organs within the body via the bloodstream is critical to not only increasing endurance, but maintaining and enhancing life as well. Without a proper breathing technique, users will always feel tired and unable to perform basic tasks. Furthermore, the ability to properly breathe aids in retarding the aging process, and revitalizes muscles for a long life. Accordingly, there exists a need for a means by which a user can be easily taught proper breathing techniques, and have such techniques reinforced so that such techniques become rote and easily reproduced in one&#39;s daily life. The use of the training device and method of use provides users the benefits of proper and healthy breathing, and helps teach them to breathe properly even when not using the invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The inventor has recognized the aforementioned inherent problems and lack in the art and observed that there is a need for a training device providing a method for assisting in training for a more effective breathing technique. It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a training device, comprising a support frame which comprises of a foot platform and a seat platform which are vertically upstanding and secured near an end of the foot platform. The device also comprises a training device assembly which has a rotating member, a transmission in mechanical communication with the rotating member via a pair of linkage members and secured within a housing attached to the rotating member, a pair of reciprocating handlebars each in mechanical communication with one (1) of the pair of linkage members, a device frame securing the rotating member and the housing to the foot platform, a processor configured to be in electrical communication with a power source, a display in electrical communication with the power source and located on the frame, a sensing means in mechanical communication with the rotation member and the transmission, and an abdominal pad adjustably attached to an upper end of a post, the post having a lower end attached to the housing. The device also comprises a resistance mechanism which is attached to each of the pair of handlebars. The foot platform also comprises a plurality of casters along the bottom surface. The support frame is secured to an upper surface of the foot platform using a plurality of fasteners which may be brackets. The seat platform may consist of a bench seat. The abdominal pad is designed with an outer curve which is adapted to align with the curves of a given user&#39;s abdomen. The abdominal pad comprises a plate affixed to a rear side of the pad and a fixture affixed to the plate opposite the pad. The fixture is capable of being secured at a given user&#39;s desired position along the post. The fixture consists of a hand knob, a threaded shaft mechanically secured to the hand knob and a support frame which has an aperture. The fixture is capable of traveling along the post and secured in place by the threaded shaft. The threaded shaft also has a captive feature which prevents the removal of the threaded shaft from the fixture. The method for using the device is as follows: step one (1), having a user obtain a device as described above; step two (2), having the user apply a force to the seat platform; step three (3), having the user adjust the abdominal pad to abut the user&#39;s abdomen; step four (4), having the user apply a force by pressing his or her abdomen against the abdominal pad; step five (5), having the user apply an alternating force by motioning the pair of reciprocating handlebars back and forth, resulting in the spinning of the rotating member; step six (6), having the user breath during steps one through five (1-5) through his or her nose and exhaling through his or her mouth; step seven (7), having the user continue the motioning, pressing, and breathing steps for a minimum of five minutes; step eight (8), having the user physically engage the display while performing the motioning, pressing, and breathing steps to regulate and monitor the user&#39;s performance; step nine (9), having the user adjust the resistance mechanism attached to each of the pair of handlebars to a desired greater or lesser force; step ten (10), having the user adjust the fixture along the length of the post; and lastly step eleven (11), having the user turn the hand knob which cause the threaded shaft to secure the fixture in place along the post.",

Such devices long have been popular for use by persons with asthma to deliver vapor medications stored under pressure, through a chamber, and ultimately, to an inhaler which is placed in the mouth of the person requiring the medication. The medicine which is dispersed in asthma inhalers, however, is vaporized liquid, which is placed in a pressure dispenser associated with the inhaler. Whenever a dosage of medicine is to be delivered, a valve is momentarily opened to dispense and vaporize the stored liquid for inhalation by the user. \n     In recent years, experimentation has been undertaken for delivering powdered medicine by way of an inhaler.

    "abstract": "This invention relates to robotic arms, and in particular to a release mechanism to allow for interchangeable arms. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In the field of robotics there has been considerable development of robotic arms having a tip following capability. Such arms can carry a workload or tool and can be used for inspection and repair in confined spaces, for instance within a jet engine or the human body. A major advance in tip following technology for robotic arms is described in our co-pending Patent Application No. WO 0216995. This application discloses a robotic arm comprising a plurality of longitudinal segments, each of which comprises one or more passive links and a control link. Control ropes or cables are provided that terminate at the control link at the end of each segment, so that by varying the length of the ropes, the arm can be caused to bend and adopt various planar or spatial shapes and configurations. This may be done for example by winding each control rope on or off a spindle using a rotary actuator or pulling the rope directly using a linear actuator. The actuators are located at the proximal end of the arm and are controlled for example by a computer control system. The ropes are generally located in the guide holes disposed towards the outer circumference of the arm. These arms are suitable for a number of operations which may require the work head at the distal end of the arm to be at adapted or changed for the intended purpose, possibly also with appropriate changes to the control means to provide the desired operation of the arm and the work head. Interchangeable work heads are widely used. However these typically involve location of rigid elements and feed through of services, for instance power and data. Certain work heads may also require additional control ropes for motion control of the work head, which ropes must also pass through the arm. This makes exchanging a work head more complicated, such that it would be advantageous to exchange both the arm and the work head together, whilst retaining the same actuators and control and power systems. The exchangeable component at the distal end (ie the arm and work head) tends to be lower cost than the proximal system end. Furthermore other factors such as wear, or sterilisation requirements, or a change in task, may make exchange of the entire arm preferable to exchange of the work head only. In order to do this, the exchange or release interface must enable mechanical and electrical power and electronic signals to be transferred. Furthermore the exchange process should not be time consuming, and should be straightforward in comparison with the task to be conducted by the arm. In order to provide an arm which is capable of ‘tip following’ along a predefined path in space in which there is little room for variance or deviation from the defined path, it is necessary to maintain the appropriate length of and tension in each control rope. In practice, due to build variance and operational effects, rope length and tension cannot be assumed. It is therefore essential that, when exchanging an arm, the control rope length and tension are managed. Furthermore the exchange may be required mid-procedure. It will be appreciated that in such circumstances the replacement arm of the same or different design as the original arm should operate in an equivalent manner. When exchanging an arm the operating algorithm may need to be changed. An arm may have different operating characteristics or may be identical except for some specific calibration parameters that are unique to a particular arm. Furthermore during the exchange process some actions are common to all control ropes, e.g. disengagement, and some actions of the specific to individual control ropes, e.g. tension control. It is advantageous to simplify the release and connect mechanisms, and where possible to use single mechanisms to achieve an action for multiple axes. There is, therefore, a need for a robotic arm in which the arm is interchangeable upon a given actuator and motor assembly, where differences in hardware or function may be managed with minimal intervention from the operator, and the coordinated exchange of a number of control ropes may ensure that control rope tension and position are maintained or re-established during the process. U.S. Pat. No. 6,866,671, U.S. Pat. No. 6,331,181 and U.S. Pat. No. 6,491,701 (Tierney) each describe a releasable tool attachment mechanism for a surgical robot. The tool uses wire ropes to transfer mechanical power from actuators through the interface to the various joints located at the tool tip. The interface also allows data to be exchanged bi-laterally. Within the tool four ropes are wound around four capstans and terminated. The releasable coupling is made between a rotating capstan and a rotating motor. The capstan is on the tool side of the exchange, which increases the cost and bulk of the tool. Also the rope is required to wrap around the capstan which leads to increased wear and reduced control of rope length due to unequal rope tension during wrap and unwrap. Furthermore the capstans are free to rotate. This means that the mechanism can be back driven and that stored energy in the rope may cause the capstan to unwind. U.S. Pat. No. 7,331,967 (Lee) describes a variation of Tierney in which three rope to rope connections are managed across three rotary couplings. This solution is complex with multiple rope pulleys and complex mechanisms to manage the coupling process. Grid type end to end connections are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 6,858,005 (Ohline) which present a different technical problem. It would be expected that the actuator associated with each rope will be of larger diameter than the rope. Hence there must be means of fanning out interface connections to the actuators. One method of achieving this is to use pulleys. These pulleys must be located some distance from the release mechanism unless the release junction is able to ride around the pulleys. Wrapping ropes around pulleys will also lead to more rapid rope wear. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a robotic arm arrangement comprising an elongate arm having a plurality of longitudinally extending control cables for controlling the position of the arm, a corresponding plurality of actuators for actuating the control cables, and a releasable coupling arrangement between each cable and the associated actuator, the coupling arrangement comprising a coupling member, in which each coupling member extends radially outwardly of the arm, and is arranged such that the actuators produce axial movement of the cable. Thus the actuators may be positioned radially around the arm, and the ropes or cables may extend axially out of the end of the arm for linear motion. With this arrangement the cables may stay substantially within the arm diameter, so that the arm may be replaced more simply. Each control cable may be equipped with an engagement member, for instance a swaged spherical ferrule, for engagement with a cooperating part associated within one end of the coupling members. Each coupling member may for example be equipped with a cup that can engage with the ferrule. The linear actuation of the control cable may thus be achieved by axial motion of the one end of the coupling members, and disengagement or reengagement may be achieved by radial motion of the one end of the coupling members. With such an arrangement, the actuators may be provided as an ‘actuator pack’, in which the actuators are arranged around an aperture for receiving the proximal end of the arm. For example the arm may have an ‘end of arm’ plate (i.e. at the end of the working part of the arm), with the cables extending axially out of the proximal end of the end of arm plate, to form a ‘cylinder’ of cables where the cables are exposed, terminating at an arm base plate. The ferrules may be provided mid way along the length of the cylinder between the end of arm plate and the arm base plate. The arrangement is preferably such that when all of the ferrules are aligned at the mid-point, the arm will be straight. The distance between the plates therefore will define the ‘stroke’ of each cable. This length may be varied depending upon the stroke required. The cables may be held in a co-linear position by a spring or elastic element. This also allows for preloading of the cables. For example the elastic element may be a cord which passes over a pulley in the arm base plate and returns to the end of arm plate internally of the cable. The cord may for example be about 1.5 times the length of the required stroke.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to the field of inhalation devices, and more specifically, to inhalation devices that utilize vibration to facilitate suspension of powder (e.g., powdered medication) into an inhaled gas stream (e.g., of inhaled air). BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Certain diseases of the respiratory tract are known to respond to treatment by the direct application of therapeutic agents. As these agents are most readily available in dry powdered form, their application is most conveniently accomplished by inhaling the powdered material through the nose or mouth. This powdered form results in the better utilization of the medicament in that the drug is deposited exactly at the site desired and where its action may be required; hence, very minute doses of the drug are often equally as efficacious as larger doses administered by other means, with a consequent marked reduction in the incidence of undesired side effects and medicament cost. Alternatively, the drug in this form may be used for treatment of diseases other than those of the respiratory system. When the drug is deposited on the very large surface areas of the lungs, it may be very rapidly absorbed into the blood stream; hence, this method of application may take the place of administration by injection, tablet, or other conventional means. It is the opinion of the pharmaceutical industry that the bioavailability of the drug is optimum when the drug particles delivered to the respiratory tract are between 1 to 5 microns in size. When the drug particles need to be in this size range the dry powder delivery system needs to address a number of issues: (1) Small size particles develop an electrostatic charge on themselves during manufacturing and storage. This causes the particles to agglomerate or aggregate, resulting in clusters of particles which have an effective size greater than 5 microns. The probability of these large clusters making it to the deep lungs then decreases. This in turn results in a lower percentage of the packaged drug being available to the patient for absorption. (2) The amount of active drug that needs to be delivered to the patient may be of the order of 10s of micrograms. For example, albuterol, in the case of a drug used in asthma, this is usually 25 to 50 micrograms. Current manufacturing equipment can effectively deliver aliquots of drugs in milligram dose range with acceptable accuracy. So the standard practice is to mix the active drug with a filler or bulking agent such as lactose. This additive also makes the drug “easy to flow”. This filler is also called a carrier since the drug particles also stick to these particles through electrostatic or chemical bonds. These carrier particles are very much larger than the drug particles in size. The ability of the dry powder inhaler to separate drug from the carrier is an important performance parameter in the effectiveness of the design. (3) Active drug particles with sizes greater than 5 microns will be deposited either in the mouth or throat. This introduces another level of uncertainty since the bioavailability and absorption of the drug in these locations is different from the lungs. Dry powder inhalers need to minimize the drug deposited in these locations to reduce the uncertainty associated with the bioavailability of the drug. Prior art dry powder inhalers (DPIs) usually have a means for introducing the drug (active drug plus carrier) into a high velocity air stream. The high velocity air stream is used as the primary mechanism for breaking up the cluster of micronized particles or separating the drug particles from the carrier. Several inhalation devices useful for dispensing this powder form of medicament are known in the prior art. For example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,507,277; 3,518,992; 3,635,219; 3,795,244; and 3,807,400, inhalation devices are disclosed having means for piercing of a capsule containing a powdered medicament, which upon inhalation is drawn out of the pierced capsule and into the user&#39;s mouth. Several of these patents disclose propeller means, which upon inhalation aid in dispensing the powder out of the capsule, so that it is not necessary to rely solely on the inhaled air to suction powder from the capsule. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 2,517,482, a device is disclosed having a powder containing capsule placed in a lower chamber before inhalation, where it is pierced by manual depression of a piercing pin by the user. After piercing, inhalation is begun and the capsule is drawn into an upper chamber of the device where it moves about in all directions to cause a dispensing of powder through the pierced holes and into the inhaled air stream. U.S. Pat. No. 3,831,606 discloses an inhalation device having multiple piercing pins, propeller means, and a self-contained power source for operating the propeller means via external manual manipulation, so that upon inhalation the propeller means aids in dispensing the powder into the stream of inhaled air. These prior art devices present several problems and possess several disadvantages that are remedied by the inhalation devices of the present invention. For instance, these prior art devices require that the user exert considerable effort in inhalation to effect dispensing or withdrawal of powder from a pierced capsule into the inhaled air stream. With these prior art devices, suction of powder through the pierced holes in the capsule caused by inhalation generally does not withdraw all or even most of the powder out of the capsule, thus causing a waste of the medicament. Also, such prior art devices result in uncontrolled amounts or clumps, of powdered material being inhaled into the user&#39;s mouth, rather than a constant inhalation of controlled amounts of finely dispersed powder. Known prior art includes a device for facilitating inhalation of a powdered medication that includes a body portion having primary and secondary air inlet channels and an outlet channel. The secondary inlet channel provides an enclosure for a capsule containing the powdered medication and the outlet channel is formed as a mouthpiece protruding from the body. A capsule piercing structure is provided, which upon rotation puts one or more holes in the capsule so that upon vibration of the capsule by an electro-mechanical vibrator, the powdered drug many be released from the capsule. The piercing means disclosed in Wilke et al includes three radially mounted, spring-biased piercing needles mounted in a trochoidal chamber. Upon hand rotation of the chamber, simultaneous inward radial motion of the needles pierces the capsule. Further rotation of the chamber allows the needles to be retracted by their spring mountings to their original positions to withdraw the needles from the capsule. The electromechanical vibrator includes, at its innermost end, a vibrating plunger rod which projects into the intersection of the inlet channel and the outlet channel. Connected to the plunger rod is a mechanical solenoid buzzer for energizing the rod to vibrate. The buzzer is powered by a high energy electric cell and is activated by an external button switch. Upon inhalation through an outlet channel and concurrent pressing of a switch to activate the electromechanical vibrating means, air is sucked through inlet channels and the air stream through the secondary inlet channel raises the capsule up against the vibrating plunger rod. The capsule is thus vibrated rapidly with powder being fluidized and dispensed from the pierced holes therein. This technique is commonly used in manufacturing for dispensing powder through a hopper where the hopper is vibrated to fluidize the powder and move it through the hopper outlet. The pierced holes in the capsule represent the hopper outlet. The air stream through the inlet channel and aids in withdrawal of powder from the capsule and carries this powder through the outlet channel to the mouth of the user. The electromechanical vibrator means may be placed at a right angle to the inlet chamber and the amplitude and frequency of vibration may be altered to regulate dispensing characteristics of the inhaler. Thus, as noted above, the vibrator&#39;s inhaler is an electromechanical device consisting of a rod driven by a solenoid buzzer. This electromechanical means may be a motor driving a cam. A disadvantage of the inhaler implementation is the relatively large mechanical movement required of the rod to effectively vibrate the capsule. The large movement of the rod, usually around 100s of microns, is necessary due to the elasticity of the capsule walls and inertia of the drug and capsule. Moreover, solenoid buzzers typically have operating frequencies less than 5 Khz. This operating frequency tends to be noisy and therefore is not desirable when incorporated into a dry powder inhaler from a patient&#39;s perspective. A further disadvantage of the electrochemical actuators is a requirement for a high energy source, thus requiring a large battery source or frequent changes of the battery pack for portable units. Both these features are not desirable from a patient safety and “ease of use” standpoint. The inhaler is primarily intended to reduce the amount of powder left behind in the capsule relative to other inhalers cited in the patent disclosure. However, the above-described device does not disaggregate the powder into particle sizes or groups less than 6 microns in size as is required for effective delivery of the medication to the lungs; rather, like the prior art inhalers, it continues to rely on an air stream velocity to disaggregate the powder ejected into the air stream, into particle sizes suitable for delivery to the lungs. In another prior art inhalation device, a liquid medication is atomized by an ultrasonic device such as a piezo element. A stream of air, usually at a high velocity, or a propellant then carries the atomized particles to the patient. The energy required to atomize the liquid medication in the nebulizer is prohibitively high, making this approach for the delivery of drugs to the lungs only feasible as a desk top unit. The high voltage requirements to drive the piezo, to produce the necessary mechanical displacements, also severely effects the weight and size of the device. It is also not obvious that the nebulizer operating principles can be applied to the dry powder inhalers for delivery or powder medication to the lungs. The prior art devices therefore have a number of disadvantages which makes them less than desirable for the delivery of dry powder to the lungs. Some of these disadvantages are: The performance of the prior art inhalers depends on the flow rate generated by the user. Lower flow rate does not result in the powder being totally disaggregated and hence adversely affects the dose delivered to the patient. Inconsistency in the bioavailability of the drugs from dose-to-dose because of lack of consistency in the disaggregation process. Large energy requirements for driving the electromechanical based inhalers which increases the size of the devices making them unsuitable for portable use.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a harness for animals, especially quadruped animals, and finds particular application in harnesses for dogs. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Conventionally a dog is led by a leading strap, or lead, attached to a collar around the neck of the dog. A lead and collar is to an extent effective to restrain a dog, although it can be uncomfortable for a dog which pulls against the lead, but this arrangement cannot be used to guide the dog to turn to the left or right; it can only be used to pull the dog to the left or right. Harnesses which pass around the body of the dog and to which a lead is attached to the middle of the harness strap across the back of the dog are also known. Such a harness is effective to restrain a dog but again can only be used to pull a dog to the left or right; not to guide it. A dog halter mounted around the nose and neck of the dog is also known. A neck loop is attached to a nose loop by cheek straps running between the neck and nose loops and a chin strap running between the neck loop and a cinch around the nose loop under the jaw of the dog. A lead is attached to the loop which passes through the cinch. Such a halter is sold under the registered trade mark HALTI®. This halter allows a dog to be restrained without discomfort to the dog and to be guided to the left or right, as the dog&#39;s head can be turned to the left or right by pulling on the lead. It has been desired to provide a harness which can restrain a dog without discomfort and which can be used to guide the dog to the left or right, rather than simply pulling it. Harnesses may be preferable to halters for some dogs and other animals since the force exerted on the dog by the halter is spread over a wider and stronger part of the body of the dog. A dog harness provided by Soft Touch Concepts of Fremont, Calif., USA has an attachment point for a lead which is fixed on a strap which lies across the chest of the dog. However, when the lead is pulled to the left or right to turn the dog, the harness has a tendency to rotate around the dog which reduces its effectiveness and may be uncomfortable for the dog. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the invention there is provided a harness for a quadruped animal including a chest strap which in use of the harness lies across the chest of the animal in front of the forelegs, the harness including an attachment for a leading strap, the attachment being slidably mounted on the chest strap for movement therealong. Preferably, each end of the chest strap is attached to a trunk loop which in use of the harness passes around the trunk of the animal behind the forelegs. The trunk loop preferably comprises a back strap which in use of the harness lies across the back of the animal affixed to a lower strap which in use of the harness passes under the animal behind the forelegs. In one preferred embodiment of the invention, a second attachment for a leading strap is provided on the back strap. Particularly preferably, the harness includes a stabilizing link, one end of which is mounted on the chest strap and the other end of which is adapted to be attached in use of the harness to a collar around the neck of the animal. More preferably, the stabilizing link is slidably mounted on the chest strap for movement therealong, and yet more preferably the attachment for a leading strap and the stabilizing link are connected so as to move together along the chest strap. The straps of the harness may be of a webbing material or any other material appropriate for use in animal harness, and may be lined with neoprene or other soft material. Preferably, the material for the chest strap is chosen so that the attachment for the leading strap cannot move along it so easily that the harness is ineffective to guide the animal (in the manner described below in the description of a preferred embodiment). Synthetic webbing such as a polyester webbing has been found to be a suitable material for the chest strap. Also according to the invention there is provided a method of controlling a dog or other quadruped animal comprising placing a harness according to the invention on the animal and attaching a leading strap to the or each attachment for a leading strap.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates generally to a unique arm support device in which the shoulder straps are designed to evenly distribute the weight of the person&#39;s arm evenly across both shoulders and not put a side load on the wearer&#39;s neck. This device also allows a patient, such as a stroke victim who has the use of only one arm and hand, to put this sling on and remove it without assistance and it works equally well for a right or left arm injury. Prior art in the field of arm support includes many different forms of slings. Most of these slings do not distribute the weight of the arm and sometimes a cast equally on both shoulders. Typically they have a strap over the opposite shoulder from the injured or inoperative arm. These single strap devices tend to place an unwanted pressure against the side of the neck. For many wheel chair bound stroke patients with the need to wear a sling during all their waking hours, the standard sling can cause the head to be pulled over and down exacerbating their original problem. There are several devices that have tried to solve this problem, one of which is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,413,552 Iwuala 1995 wherein a sling with Humeral Stabilizer is disclosed. All though this device claims to have eliminated the side load to the neck it is a fairly complex mechanism with two straps, multiple strap fasteners and adjusters and fastens to a torso belt. The most significant problem with these type support devices is that they would be very difficult if not impossible for a person with the use of only one hand to put on or take off without assistance and will be relatively expensive to manufacture. The second patented device that attempts to solve this problem is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,141,488 Schrader 1992 wherein a basic pair of suspenders, crossed in the back and clipped on the waist band of a skirt or pair of slacks in both the front and back have adjustable length loops secured to the front of each strap. One adjustable length loop supports the hand or wrist of a patient while the second supports the lower arm. Again this device would be virtually impossible for a person with the use of only one arm to put on or take off with out assistance.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to a self contained water tank, primarily for use in fire suppression activities within an area of active timber harvesting, which can be quickly transported by such timber harvesting equipment as a grapple skidder, over rough terrain where road access is generally unavailable. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Much of the activity surrounding timber harvesting are concerned with minimizing the potential fire risk in an area of abundant natural combustible fuel. In most commercial operations the act of felling, bucking, skidding and transportation are hot activities relying on engines utilizing flammable fuels with the associated high risk of accidental fire. Containment of the initial fire in a forested area depends upon the availability of an adequate stand-by water supply, to douse the fire and surrounding forest litter and to ensure that embers do not re-ignite immediately thereafter. The need, then, for an adequate supply of water, on stand-by, for fire suppression activities in areas where timber harvesting is active is self evident, especially where such supply of water is within a tank and therefore, readily transportable by a grapple skidder over generally rough terrain which may be blocked by logging debris. It is, then, an object of the present invention to provide a stand-by water tank which is suitably constructed so as to be readily transportable by a grapple skidder or other similar piece of logging equipment, over rough terrain to the site of a fire. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a stand-by water tank which is a self contained unit having mounted and stored thereon pumping apparatus and a supply of fuel. The pump preferably being a ‘two way’ pump, which is capable of either discharging water under pressure from the tank, or from an alternative water source or for refilling the tank. Further it is an object of this invention to provide a stand-by tank, which, in an alternative embodiment may be used as a fuel storage tank. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In summary the stand-by tank for remote access fire suppression is a tank which is manufactured, for example, from ⅜ inch steel, so as to be readily transportable by a grapple skidder or like forest harvesting equipment. The tank has an elongated generally cylindrically shaped metal body section having first and second ends, which enclose an interior cavity which may be filled with a fire suppressing liquid such a water. The first end of the tank has attached thereto near the lowest point a drain pipe and a suitable closure cap. Supports on the bottom surface of the tank provide stability to the tank when placed upon the ground and permit sufficient clearance between the bottom of the tank and the ground to permit the grapple of the skidder to close tightly around the tank. The top portion of the tank, intermediate the first and second ends, has a sturdy metal saddle on which the skidder grapple rests and which aligns the skidder grapple with the point of balance of the tank. Welded to the inner surface of the tank in general alignment with the saddle is a reinforcing collar or other suitable means which will prevent compressive deformation of the stand-by tank by the grapple, when the tank is gripped and lifted by the grapple of the skidder. A compartmentalized storage container with closable lid, is positioned on the top portion of the tank near the first end. This container holds a pump in one compartment and in the other holds a container of fuel for the pump and lengths of suction and discharge hose. The pump is a two-way suction and discharge type installed on the standby tank in a manner that will permit water to be drawn either from the tank or from an alternative water source and discharged under pressure at a fire, or from an alternative source such as a tank truck to refill the tank. A filling pipe and suitable closure are located on the top portion of the tank near the second end. This fill pipe is of a diameter that will prevent the coupling end of the suction hose from passing through so that the suction hose may be left within the standby tank during times of transport or storage. A stabilizing loop or chain is positioned at the second end of the tank adjacent the filling pipe. Where the grapple skidder has a winch, the cable from the winch is connected to this loop to prevent the tank from swinging as the skidder traverses uneven ground. It is anticipated that the tank may be readily adapted for the storage and transportation of fuel to areas under active timber harvesting where access is unsuitable for conventional vehicles. In an alternative embodiment of this invention, the stand-by tank may be adapted to contain, in a separate storage compartment, a concentrated water based fire suppression/retardant compounds such as foam. The storage compartment is directly connected to the suction inlet port of the pump for a metered supply of foam into the water stream being pumped onto the fire. In summary, the five suppression tank of the present invention includes a hollow thin-walled elongate container having first and second opposite ends. The container is seeded for containing water. The container has a balance point generally mid-way along its length about which point the container is balanced when at least partially filled with water. Wall reinforcement for reinforcing walls of the container is mounted to the container at the balance point. The reinforcement bears the compressive force of a grapple when grappling the container. The grapple is an actuable grapple on an actuable arm of a logging vehicle. In the preferred embodiment the container is metal and the wall reinforcement is a metal collar mounted annularly and laterally around the walls of the container. A saddle may be mounted to the collar for aligning the grapple onto the collar and for bearing of the grapple against the saddle.",

    "abstract": "The invention relates to agents having potent antifibrillogenic activity for the treatment of amyloidosis disorders and for imaging of amyloid deposits. These agents include peptides and peptidomimetic compounds thereof. (b) Description of Prior Art Amyloidosis refers to a pathological condition characterized by the presence of amyloid fibers. Amyloid is a generic term referring to a group of diverse but specific extracellular protein deposits that are seen in a number of different diseases. Though diverse in their occurrence, all amyloid deposits share common morphologic properties, stain with specific dyes (e.g. Congo red), and have a characteristic red-green birefringent appearance in polarized light after staining. They also share common ultrastructural, x-ray diffraction and infrared spectra features. Some amyloidotic diseases can be idiopathic but most of these diseases appear as a complication of a previously existing disorder. For example, primary amyloidosis can appear without any other pathology or can follow plasma cell dyscrasia or multiple myeloma. Secondary amyloidosis is usually seen associated with chronic infection (such as tuberculosis) or chronic inflammation (such as rheumatoid arthritis). A familial form of secondary amyloidosis is also seen in Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). This familial type of amyloidosis, as one of the other types of familial amyloidosis, is genetically inherited and is found in specific population groups. Isolated forms of amyloidosis are those that tend to involve a single organ system. Different amyloids are also characterized by the type of protein present in the deposit. For example, neurodegenerative diseases such as scrapie, bovine spongiform encephalitis, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and the like are characterized by the appearance and accumulation of a protease-resistant form of a prion protein (referred to as AScr or PrP-27) in the central nervous system. Similarly, Alzheimer&#39;s disease, another neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by congophilic cerebral angiopathy, neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. In this case, the plaque and blood vessel amyloid is formed by the deposition of fibrillar Aβ amyloid protein. In adult-onset diabetes, amyloids containing the IAPP amyloid protein accumulate in the pancreas. Other systemic diseases, complications of long-term hemodialysis and sequelae of long-standing inflammation or plasma cell dyscrasias are characterized by the accumulation of amyloids systemically. In each of these cases, a different amyloidogenic protein is involved in amyloid deposition. Once these amyloids have formed, there is no known, widely accepted therapy or treatment that significantly dissolves the deposits in situ. Each amyloidogenic protein has the ability to organize into β-sheet and to form insoluble fibrils that get deposited extracellularly. Each amyloidogenic protein, although different in amino acid sequence has the same property of forming fibrils and binding to other elements such as proteoglycan (glycosaminoglycan), amyloid P and complement component. Moreover, each amyloidogenic protein has amino acid sequences which, although different, will show similarities such as regions with the ability to bind to GAG&#39;s (referred to as the GAG binding site) as well as other regions which will promote β-sheet formation referred to as β-sheet region. In specific cases, amyloidotic fibrils once deposited can become toxic to the surrounding cells. As per example, the Aβ fibrils organized as senile plaques have been shown to be associated with dead neuronal cells and microgliosis in patients with Alzheimer&#39;s disease. When tested in vitro, Aβ peptide was shown to be capable of triggering an activation process of the microglia (brain macrophages), which would explain the presence of microgliosis and brain inflammation found in the brain of patients with Alzheimer&#39;s disease. In another type of amyloidosis seen in patients with Type II diabetes, the islet amyloidogenic protein, IAPP, has been shown to induce β-islet cell toxicity in vitro. Hence, appearance of IAPP fibrils in the pancreas of Type II diabetic patients could contribute to the loss of the β islet cells (Langerhans) and organ dysfunction. Particularly, in patients with Alzheimer&#39;s Disease, an agent capable 1) of preventing amyloid fibril formation and deposition and 2) of directly or indirectly inhibiting Aβ-induced neurotoxicity and inflammation (microgliosis), could be a treatment of choice to prevent and arrest the development of Alzheimer&#39;s disease. WO-A-9808868 concerns compounds that modulate natural beta-amyloid peptide aggregation. The compounds comprise a peptide, preferably based on a beta-amyloid peptide, that is comprised of 3–5 D-amino acid residues and includes at least two D-amino acid residues independently selected from the group consisting of D-leucine, D-phenylalanine and D-valine. In one embodiment the peptide is a retro-inverso isomer of a beta-amyloid peptide. In certain embodiments, the peptide is modified at the amino-terminus, the carboxy-terminus, or both. It would be highly desirable to be provided with agents having potent antifibrillogenic activity for the treatment of amyloidosis disorders. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One aim of the present invention is to provide agents having potent antifibrillogenic activity for the treatment of amyloidosis disorders. Another aim of the present invention is to provide a method for the treatment of amyloidosis disorders, such as Alzheimer&#39;s&#39; disease. A number of strategies for possible therapeutic intervention in amyloid development have been proposed. These strategies include reduction of the pool of precursor proteins, prevention of the interaction of precursor proteins and disruption of preformed amyloid. The present invention deals mainly with the second approach, prevention of precursor protein interactions. The ideal molecule to fulfill this function, would interact specifically with the amyloid protein and would in so doing prevent the protein from interacting with itself. When dealing with molecules that are chiral, it is standard practice to identify which of the stereoisomers possesses the activity, since in general, activity can be attributed to one or the other of the isomers. By using a stereochemically pure isomer, side reactions can be avoided or reduced. In accordance with one embodiment of the present invention there is provided an antifibrillogenic agent for inhibiting amyloidosis and/or for cytoprotection, which comprises a peptide of Formula I, an isomer thereof, a retro or a retro-inverso isomer thereof or a peptidomimetic thereof:",

    "abstract": "The devices, systems, and methods of this invention each have several aspects, no single one of which is solely responsible for its desirable attributes. Without limiting the scope of this invention, its more prominent features will now be discussed briefly. In one embodiment, the invention provides a portable oxygen concentrator that incorporates novel mechanical design elements to achieve a low noise, low vibration, durable, and easily repaired design. This integrated design approach enables the portable oxygen concentrator of the preferred embodiments to meet the needs of the patients and equipment providers where prior art designs have failed. The novel mechanical design elements include the assembly method of the outer housing components, low volume vibration isolation of the compressor, overlapping housing baffles, and floating column clip assembly system. Even the inventors&#39; most robust mechanical designs may succumb to the continued abuse of some users, so the inventors designed a novel outer housing assembly system that allows for fast in inexpensive refurbishment of the concentrators so that equipment providers can minimize repair time and cost. In certain preferred embodiments, none of the internal functional components of the housing assembly are anchored to the housing panels, which allows for fast replacement as well as improved vibration and noise isolation. In a preferred embodiment the housing of the portable oxygen concentrator comprises at least of four panels that snap fit together to form convoluted sound baffles for noise abatement. The outer housing panels preferably snap together with retention clips, and some of these clips may be further secured with fasteners in order to still meet the rigorous durability requirements of this class of device. In one embodiment, at least two of the panels when assembled form an inlet air plenum, and at least two panels form an outlet air plenum. In a particular aspect, the air plenum is a space between a double-walled section formed by the assembled panels. In one particular embodiment, the side panels wrap around the front and back of the device to mate together forming the inner wall of the double-walled structure. The side panels further have mirror-imaged cut outs to form the inner air vent opening at the front of the device and the inner exhaust vent opening at the rear of the device. To form the outer wall of the intake or exhaust plenum, a convex and stylized end panel is snapped over the mated side panels forming a hollow air plenum. The opening in the end panel is offset from the opening formed in the wall section of the side panels and the air flows through the space formed between the end panels and the wall section of the side panels. The path through both plenums is offset, preferably substantially non-overlapping or completely non-overlapping, to provide noise isolation. A mesh screen may be used on the inlet to keep the airways clear of debris. Between the inlet and outlet plenum there is at least one air barrier, preferably sealed to the housing panels, preferably nonridgidly with foam. An air mover, typically a cooling fan or blower, is carried by the air barrier and provides a forced air path through the barrier. In a preferred embodiment, the air barrier is a printed circuit board. In one as-built embodiment, the adsorbent bed columns are on the inlet side of the air barrier and the compressor is on the outlet side. In another embodiment, a bottom panel includes a battery mount, and the battery and panels go together such that when the battery is installed, the battery contacts and retains at least two and preferably all of the front, side and rear panels to improve the rigidity of the assembly. The battery is also preferably part of the aesthetic design of the housing. In another preferred embodiment, the adsorbent columns are carried by a plurality of, preferably two, vibration/shock absorbing mounting elements. These mounting elements may be foam blocks with cutouts, such that the columns are held by the blocks and do not come into direct with the housing. In a particular embodiment, the foam is molded urethane. Additionally, the concentrator may contain one or more modular clips that locate the absorbers and other components relative to each other between the blocks without making any attachments to the housing components. In a particular embodiment, the modular clips also mount the air barrier/mover, preferably a circuit board and cooling fan, to form an air dam that allows for unidirectional cooling flow that simultaneously intakes room air for the PSA cycle and exhausts waste nitrogen gas from the system without recirculation. Other elements that may be mounted with the columns in the floating assembly include an air dryer, an oxygen product accumulator, and an oxygen sensor. In a preferred embodiment, the compressor is mounted to a bracket which is in turn mounted to one or more of the housing panels, preferably a non-exterior housing panel to maintain ease of outer housing replacement. The compressor is mounted to the bracket with shock/vibration isolating elements, which in one embodiment may be overmolded rubberized mounts. The bracket is preferably mounted to the housing with a further set of shock/vibration isolating elements, providing two levels of isolation. In one embodiment, the bracket mounting elements are rubberized feet and in a particular version rubber feet with a durometer of 20 A to 60 A. In one version, the bracket is aluminum. The bracket may additionally mount one or more airflow manifolds. The bracket and the lower housing may also preferably include bump stops to limit compressor and bracket deflection during drop or impact. In one version of the invention, the compressor intake is routed through the fan ducting to ensure a supply of fresh air is always drawn into the compressor. In another embodiment, an inlet air filter attaches to the compressor. The filter preferably has a tortuous air path for noise reduction, and further may be mounted with its inlet and outlet at right angles to each other for further noise reduction. Substantially all air connections to and from the filter/compressor assemble are by compliant airflow components, and in a particular embodiment molded compliant airflow components to ensure minimum force is applied to the compressor when it is located in its nominal position. In another embodiment, the compressor is a two piston unit where the piston inputs are fluidly connected by a low profile compliant member. The compliant member in one version comprises one snap fit and one threaded attachment to the pistons. In various versions, the compliant member may be at least two parts of molded rubber joined together, and the member cross section is in the range of 0.02 to 0.08 square inches. In another embodiment, the portable oxygen concentrator includes a pressure sensor mount where a compliant bracket mounts the pressure sensor and in turn the bracket is mounted to a circuit card. This has the effect of eliminating the hard mounting of the sensor at its designed attachment points, improving the tolerance of the sensor to false readings due to vibration.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to safety helmets, and in particular to attachment of accessories that may be optionally mounted onto the helmet. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Helmets for head protection are worn in a variety of environments and for various purposes. Accessories may be added to the helmet according to the needs of the wearer and the demands of the use environment. Such accessories may, for example, provide additional protection, as in the case of a face shield, or additional capability such as night vision. The prior art includes two approaches to attachment of accessories: through-holes and clamps. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,009,562, 6,009,561, 4,222,123, and 5,978,973, for example, describe attachment to the shell of a helmet by means of a through-hole and specialized grommets. While the through-holes provide secure attachment, they do not lend themselves to easy affixation and removal, are not adjustable in position, and may compromise the integrity of the helmet shell. Clamping devices are taught, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,788,724 and 4,224,694. While these designs accommodate some positional adjustment and do not require through-holes in the shell, the security of the attachment is limited, and they do not provide for multiple accessories. In law-enforcement, fire-fighting, and military applications, for example, the ability to attach multiple accessories may be important. Therefore, there exists a need to facilitate convenient attachment and detachment of multiple accessories to a helmet. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a platform herein referred to as a “mounting rail” that accepts one or multiple optional accessories to a safety helmet at desired locations and with positional security. The mounting rail may have slides, threaded holes, or other mounting fixtures suited to securing the accessories. The mounting rail of the present invention may be configured to present a relatively low-profile protrusion from the helmet using physical surfaces that offer low risk of snagging or being caught in external devices when accessories are not in place. The invention allows for adjustment of the position of the accessories when they are attached to the mounting rail, which desirably accepts more than one optional accessory. The mounting rail of the present invention utilizes an interface structure secured to the outer shell of the helmet, providing surfaces for mounting accessories onto the mounting rail instead of directly onto the helmet. In some embodiments, the mounting rail may be secured to the helmet shell using existing through-holes in the helmet shell and the fasteners already employed in connection with helmet-retention components such as straps or headbands. The fasteners may be, for example, rivets or nuts and bolts and may be made from plastic (for light-duty applications), stainless steel, or forge-hardened steel (for helmets providing ballistic protection). A preferred embodiment of the mounting rail comprises a molded component conforming to the shape of the outer shell of the helmet. In some versions, the bottom edge of the rail fixture (which itself includes one or more rails) conforms to the bottom edge of the helmet, while in other versions, the entire fixture is raised on the side of the helmet, residing, for example, over (and conforming to at least a portion of) a bulge or other protrusion or discontinuity in the helmet. The rail fixture desirably spans a sufficient circumference of the helmet shell to overlap at least two existing through-holes provided for securing retention components thereto. The mounting rail may then be secured to the helmet shell by sharing fasteners with the retention components using these through-holes. A benefit of this embodiment is that the mounting rail can be added to already-manufactured helmets by providing the appropriate mounting rail with mounting holes at the dimensions of the existing through-holes in the helmet. If necessary, modified fasteners, which may be longer than the standard fasteners, can be provided to secure both the mounting rail and the existing retention components using the existing through-holes. Avoiding the need for additional through-holes to secure the mounting rail means that the safety features of the shell are not altered. It should be stressed, however, that the use of existing through-holes is by no means necessary. Other approaches such as co-molding or thermo-bonding with the shell, bonding using adhesives, or a combination of adhesives and one or more fasteners can be used to secure the mounting rail to the helmet shell (or to fabricate it integrally therewith). As used herein, the term “rail” refers to a mounting facility with parallel boundaries, and which slidably accepts a complementary engagement member. The preferred embodiment of the mounting rail includes a recessed groove open on at least one end and preferably on both ends. Accessories having an engagement member complementary to the recessed groove may be attached to the mounting rail by sliding the engagement member into the mounting-rail groove and securing it in place. The preferred cross-sectional profile for the groove is flat on the surface toward the helmet with angular side walls; this configuration is sometimes referred to as a dove-tail recessed groove. The opening width of the groove may range from 0.25 to 1.0 inch (and is preferably 0.75 inch) with walls angled inward from 30° to 60° (and preferably at 45°). The dovetail shape retains the attaching component by means of the angled walls, but the profile may be any suitably retentive shape (such as an “L” or “T” shape) having edges that slidably retain an attaching component, allowing it to reach a desired position where it is secured into place. Means for securing the position of the mounting element are well known in the art and may include, for example, a “thumbscrew” tightener or a “tab-and-slot” engagement mechanism. Accordingly, in a first aspect, the invention comprises a mounting facility for a safety helmet. The mounting facility comprises a rail, securable to the helmet, for slidably receiving an accessory therein. An inner surface of the rail may have a contour conforming to the helmet, or the rail may be formed integrally with the helmet. The mounting facility desirably has sloped ends. In general, the mounting facility of the present invention will comprise a recessed retaining groove, e.g., a dovetail arrangement involving a flat inner surface and a pair of angled side walls opposed to the inner surface, or an L or T shape. The retaining groove may be substantially flat in extent, or may have a constant-radius curvature. In a second aspect, the invention comprises safety helmet including a helmet shell, a mounting facility comprising at least one rail, securable to the helmet shell, for slidably receiving an accessory engagement member therein, and at least one accessory engagement member positionable within the at least one rail and securable thereto. In addition to any one or more of the features described above, the mounting facility may have a plurality of apertures aligning with existing through-holes in the helmet shell for facilitating affixation thereto. The mounting facility may further comprise at least one threaded hole for threadably accepting an accessory; means for accepting an element conforming to the rear of the helmet shell; and/or means for accepting a hinged connecting element on the front of the helmet.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to an adjustable keyboard support, for holding a keyboard relative to some work surface or work member particularly for keyboards of computer terminals, such as word processors and other terminals, drawings and digitizing pads. In particular the invention relates to a keyboard support which can be extended and retracted and can also be varied in height in an extended position. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Keyboard supports are well known, as are extendable and retractable supports. However, the actual height of the keyboard, when the support is extended, is determined by the geometry of the support and is not variable. With the use of computers and similar hardware now commonplace, various user ailments have developed. These ailments include back pain from poor posture while at the terminal, neck pain, wrist difficulties, etc. A more common ailment experienced by computer users is repetitive strain injury which is a group of disorders affecting muscles, tendons and nerves. This occurs from activities involving awkward posture and repetitive movement of the same muscles frequently without allowing the muscles any rest periods. Currently, repetitive strain injuries are recognized as a leading cause of productivity losses and as an economic burden on society. The present invention circumvents the discomfort experienced by computer users by providing a keyboard support which permits the keyboard to be adjustable in height. This enables a user to adjust the attitude of the keyboard for ease and comfort of operation to a more orthopaedically favourable position. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with one object of the present invention, there is provided a keyboard support which includes a keyboard carriage which provides elevation adjustment as well as tilt. In such an arrangement much of the muscle stress experienced by computer users can be alleviated since each user can adjust the keyboard to a suitable non-strenuous attitude. Another object of the present invention is to provide an adjustable keyboard support comprising a support frame having two extendable and retractable side members; each side member including a rear member and a front member extendable and retractable relative to the rear member; means for pivotally attaching each rear member at its rear end to a terminal support stand; a lever pivotally attached at its lower end to each front member at an intermediate position and including means for pivotally attaching each lever at its upper end to the terminal support stand, the arrangement being such that initial extension of the support frame moves each front member forward and down to a lowest position, continued extension moving the front member forward and upward. Generally, the support comprises tubular metal sufficiently strong to impart adequate support without excessive weight. Such metal may be aluminium, stainless steel, etc. Suitable plastic material may be used as well e.g. ABS, PVC, etc. Further the metal support may be electroplated with chromium for example, or electrochemically treated with other materials for appearance purposes. The extension and retraction of the support is achieved by telescopic motion which may be effected by, for example, incorporating piston and cylinder arrangements known in the art. A further object of the present invention is to provide an adjustable keyboard support with which the user may operate the keyboard in an orthopaedically favourable position. The support may optionally include a wrist rest comprising a padded cylinder extending between the support adjacent the keyboard. In one embodiment of the present invention initial extension of the keyboard support pivots the levers down and forward at their ends attached to front member, to a generally vertical position on the levers. Further extension pivots the levers forward and up at their ends attached to the front members, causing the forward end of the support member, and the keyboard, to move up. The further extension can be varied at will, to give a variable height of the keyboard. Means may be provided to locking the support member in any desired extension. A still further object of the present invention is to provide an adjustable keyboard support comprising a support frame having two extendable and retractable side members; each side member including a rear member and a front member extendable and retractable relative to the rear member; means for pivotally attaching each rear member at its rear end to a terminal support stand; a first lever pivotally attached at its lower end to each front member at an intermediate position and including means for pivotally attaching each first lever at its upper end to the terminal support stand, a keyboard carriage member adapted to receive a keyboard movably mounted to each front member, a second lever pivotally connected at its lower end to each front member and spaced forwardly of the first lever, each second lever being pivotally connected to the keyboard carriage whereby initial extension of the support frame moves each front member forward thereby facilitating the keyboard carriage to be moved vertically and angularly inclined to the support member. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an adjustable keyboard support comprising a support frame having two side members, each side member including a forward end, a rear end and an intermediate portion, first lever means pivotally attached at lower ends thereof to each rear end of the side members; second lever means pivotally attached at lower ends thereof to each intermediate portion of the side members, the first and second lever means including means for pivotally attaching the first and second lever means at upper ends thereof to the terminal support stand; and means for pivotally interconnecting each of the first and second lever means of each of the side members, the arrangement being such that the support frame is swingably moveable from a lowest position to a position forward and upward therefrom. By employing lever linkages in the embodiments of the present invention, multiple dimensional adjustment may be achieved.",

    "abstract": "It is known that the definition of the term tumor necrosis factor (TNF) includes two cytotoxic factors (TNF- α and TNF-β) which are essentially formed by activated lymphocytes and monocytes. The term TNF derives from the property which initially attracted particular attention from those skilled in the art: TNF has a necrotic effect on certain tumors in vivo. This effect was found for the first time when it was observed that, in cases of cancer, bacterial infections may result in a regression of the tumor. It was initially assumed that lipopolysaccharides from the cell walls of bacteria, which are called endotoxin, are responsible for the regression of the tumor. However, it was later shown that the endotoxin itself had no direct antitumor effect but in turn induces the formation of a factor which is responsible for the tumor necrosis. This factor was then called TNF. Further investigations later revealed that TNF is principally formed by macrophages. It was likewise shown, by stimulation of lymphocytes in vitro, that there is formation of a substance having cytotoxic activity, which was called lymphotoxin. The close relationship between TNF and lymphotoxin was only recently discovered after the two proteins had been prepared in pure form, their primary structure had been established and their cDNAs had been isolated and expressed. This revealed remarkable similarities in the two proteins and their genes. Great similarities were also evident from the biological activities of these two proteins. For this reason, they were called TNF-α and TNF-β, corresponding to their formation from monocytes or lymphocytes.",

Differences from the subject invention which are common to each of the references is that none of them in their specific styles or size proportions are capable of safely holding for display to a skater moving at the pace of music, the set of ice dance diagram cards especially designed for the subject holder. The foreign patent of 1916 by Maisch of Switzerland is for a leather wrist mount sketch and note pad holder with pencils. Had the designer intended to display individual printed graphics he could have if he would have sized such displays to fit his holder. However his holder concept would not accept the size and the stacked set of graphic cards that the subject invention is designed for, and his holder does not provide for rotatable viewing orientation as required of the dance graphics designed for the subject invention device. The U.S. 1922 patent by Weiss is for a wrist mount holder for paper or erasable reusable surface note pad with pencil, and an openable windowed protective cover for writing through the windows. The concept did not contemplate holding otherwise printed graphics or stacks of such as provided for by the subject invention device. The U.S. 1937 patent by Canfield is for a wrist mount holder for miniature paper note pads from which used sheets can be removed. The concept did not contemplate holding otherwise printed graphics or stacks of such as provided for by the subject invention device. The U.S. 1970 patent by Bohanski is for a wrist mount rotatable holder for flashlights. The wrist mount purpose is similar to the hands freeing function of the subject invention device. And the rotatable purpose is similar to the direction orienting function of the subject invention device, except that Bohanski&#39;s rotation is held in increments of orientation by a circle of spaced mechanical bumps on its mount plate, whereas the rotation of the subject invention device is infinite as to position setting. The rotatable position hold function of the subject invention is considered to be an improvement over Bohanski&#39;s concept and that of other rivet and nut/bolt types of rotation fastenings of holders to wrist mounts, for the following reasons. The invention device any position holding functions through the close mating and surface friction between four relatively large diameter disk surfaces that are part of the wrist mount to holder assembly, as will be further explained below and through the drawings. Also the large diameters of the disks and their large diameter joining stem provide strong fastening strength, with parts that do not tear out of plastic surfaces with use such as normal diameter metal rotational fasteners can. The U.S. 1990 patent by Stewart is for a thigh mounted holder for such as relatively large writing tablet clip boards used while seated. That the tablet holder rotates is a principal feature of the device. Eight optional position direction positions are available. The position locking device and the mount to holder fastening are strong, related to the large clip board and the strength of a leg thigh. The mechanisms are too strong and too elaborate relative to the simple light weight parts of the subject invention graphic cards holder for use on wrists. The U.S. 1995 patent by Greene is for mounting protectively transparent laminated ski run area maps on wrists. The laminated sandwich has cuts in the back sheet which accept wrist mounting straps. The sandwich flex curves over the wrist and its clothing. Similar to what professional football quarterbacks and coaches are presently using for play referencing. Ice dance diagrams could be individually handled with such a concept, but not equivalent to the subject invention holder with its stacking capacity, clearer to read non-covered graphics, and rotatable features. The U.S. 1996 patent by Wiltshire is for a small in area but relatively high miniature wrist mount memo pad device with pencil. The height of the device relates to its having a stack of miniature file drawers for storing miniature writing paper and written memos. There are several additional elaborate features on this device, but none that would reasonably relate to the for learning aid graphic display features of the subject invention holder. The U.S. 1998 patent by Petersen is for a small portable sorting tray for mail workers. The tray mounts on the underside of a forearm above the wrist and is rotatable. The tray mounted on the underside of the forearm permits the hand on that arm to participate in holding letter envelope sorting. A metal bolt with washers fastens the tray to the arm mount and brake holds rotation through its providing compression between mating surfaces. This fastener/position holding method is mechanically natural and is similar to that used for early versions of the subject invention holder. The present design for the rotation and fastening of the subject holder is a significant improvement, as outlined under patent by Bohanski above. The above reference documents are indirectly related to the application of this invention in that several pertain to a device for holding something on a wrist. None of their designs are capable of displaying specially designed graphic cards to a skater moving at the pace of music. The invention&#39;s open face display, unique rotate mechanism, display holding living hinge tabs, and light weight plastic capable of withstanding ice rink conditions, are improvements over the indirect references. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention comprises a rotatable, wrist-mountable holder which receives visual aid diagrams for people learning to dance on ice skates. The holder can hold one or more sets of visual aids, such as cards having dance patterns printed on them, thus freeing the hands of the skater while practicing. The holder can be rotated on the skater&#39;s wrist to orient an ice pattern diagram to correspond with the ice rink geometry and the skater&#39;s position on the ice. In addition, the holder allows the visual aids to be changed with one hand when the holder is mounted on a user&#39;s wrist. All of the corners of the holder are rounded so that it has no sharp edges.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates generally to an exercise device. More particularly, the invention concerns an exercise device permitting a user to perform alternatively a stair stepping exercise or a cross country skiing exercise, or simultaneously to perform a stair stepping exercise and a cross country skiing exercise. 2. Description of Prior Art Heretofore, various exercise devices have been provided to permit a user to perform a stair stepping exercise which simulates the climbing of stairs. Also, various exercise devices have been provided to permit a user to perform a cross country skiing exercise which simulates cross country skiing. However, none of the exercise devices heretofore have permitted in a single exercise machine, the simultaneous performance of a stair stepping exercise and a cross country skiing exercise. No prior exercise device has allowed a user to change the exercise he is doing while on the machine from stair climbing to cross country skiing to a bicycle-like motion to a backward walk motion, all without mechanical adjustment of the machine. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,970,302 dated Jul. 20, 1976, shows an exercise device in which a pair of foot supports are mounted for movement along an inclined track to simulate stair climbing. A pair of shock absorbers connected to the foot supports resist downward movement resulting from a downward force exerted by the feet of a user and provide upward return movement of the foot supports to a predetermined position. There is no showing of an exercise movement simulating cross country skiing. U.S. Pat. No. 4,685,666 dated Aug. 11, 1987, likewise shows an exercise device to simulate a climbing or stair stepping motion, but such exercise device does not provide a cross country skiing exercise. U.S. Pat. No. 4,733,858 dated Mar. 29, 1988, shows a multi-purpose exercise device which may be utilized to perform various exercises. The device is used in a first position to practice climbing such as climbing steps. The device is adjusted to a second position to simulate a skating motion. There is no provision for performing a climbing exercise and a skating exercise simultaneously with the device remaining in one position. U.S. Pat. No. 5,000,442 dated Mar. 19, 1990, shows a cross country ski simulator in which foot supports are mounted for generally horizontal back and forth movement with manually gripped handles controlling the movement of the foot supports and providing a resistance to the movement of the foot supports. Such ski simulator does not provide a simulated climbing or stair stepping exercise performed simultaneously with the cross country skiing exercise. Identification of Objects of the Invention It is an object of this invention to provide such an exercise device having a pair of foot supports movable in a generally vertical direction in a stair stepping exercise and movable simultaneously in a generally horizontal direction in a cross country skiing exercise. A further object of this invention is to provide an exercise device having a pair of foot supports thereon which are mounted for simultaneous movement in combined horizontal and vertical directions while the foot supports remain in a horizontal plane. An additional object of the invention is to provide an exercise device having a pair of foot supports mounted for combined generally vertical and horizontal movements with a force resisting member for each foot support in each direction.",

    "abstract": "The present invention provides polymers that are based on α-amino acids. In contrast to conventional poly(α-amino acids), the polymers of the present invention (e.g., elastomeric functional copolyester amides and copolyester urethanes) possess advantageous physical, chemical and biodegradation properties. For example, the polymers of the present invention possess suitable biodegradation (weight loss percent) properties under varying conditions, (see, Table III). The hydrolysis of the polymers can be catalyzed by hydrolases (e.g., trypsin, α-chymotrypsin, lipase, etc.). As such, the polymers can be used as carriers for covalent immobilization (attachment) of various drugs and other bioactive substances. In addition, the enzyme catalyzed biodegradation rates of the polymer of the present invention can be changed by varying the polymer composition (e.g., l/p ratio) and/or the nature of the functional groups (e.g., dicarboxylic acids, diols, or α-amino acids). The present invention provides a polymer of formula (VII): m is about 0.1 to about 0.9; p is about 0.9 to about 0.1; n is about 50 to about 150; each R 1  is independently (C 2 -C 20 )alkylene; each R 2  is independently hydrogen, or (C 6 -C 10 )aryl(C 1 -C 6 )alkyl; each R 3  is independently hydrogen, (C 1 -C 6 )alkyl, (C 2 -C 6 )alkenyl, (C 2 -C 6 )alkynyl, or (C 6 -C 10 )aryl(C 1 -C 6 )alkyl; and each R 4  is independently (C 2 -C 20 )alkylene; comprising one or more subunits of the formula (I): and one or more subunits of the formula (II):",
    "full_text": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n     While they potentially offer many advantages due to their “organic nature,” conventional poly(α-amino acids) possess many undesirable physical, chemical and biodegradation properties. For example, the biological and material properties of conventional poly(α-amino acids) cannot be varied over a wide range. In addition, the synthesis of many conventional poly(α-amino acids) is difficult and expensive. \n     A considerable amount of attention has therefore been focussed on replacing the amide (peptide) linkage in the conventional poly(α-amino acids) with a variety of non-amide bond to provide novel polymeric systems that are based on α-amino acids. One class of α-amino acid derived polymers are polyisopeptides (alternatively known as pseudo-poly(amino acids)), which belong to the XY-type heterochain polymers. Polyisopeptides are usually foamed by linking trifunctional α-amino acids in the backbone chains. However, relatively few attempts have been made t...",

    "abstract": "Disclosed herein is an external fixation system. The external fixation system includes a ring element having a planar portion and an adjustable device having a body releasably mounted on the planar portion of the ring element. The adjustable device further includes a first member mounted on the body for movement in a direction generally perpendicular to the planar ring portion; a second member pivotally mounts on the first member for angular movement with respect to the body; a third member mounts on the second member for movement with respect to a circumference of the ring element; and a bone engaging element mounts on the third member. Further, disclosed herein is an external fixation system including a ring element having a planar portion; and an adjustable device including a body, a first member and a second member. The body being releasably mounted on the ring element. Further, the first member is capable of moving in a direction perpendicular to a planar surface on the ring element and the second member is capable of linear motion about the circumference of the ring element. The body, first member, and second member each include a planar surface; and the planar surface of the body contacts a first planar surface of the first member and second planar surface on the first member is in contact with a first planar surface of the second member. Also disclosed herein is a method for realigning a broken bone. The method includes providing an external fixation device having a ring member, a first adjustable device, and a second adjustable device. The first adjustable device having a body attached to the ring member, a first member mounted on the body, a second member mounted on the first member, and a third member mounted on the second member. The second adjustable device having a body attached to the ring member, a first member mounted on the body, a second member mounted on the first member, and a third member attached to the second member. Further, a first k-wire or half pin is inserted through a first piece of a broken bone and the first k-wire or half pin is affixed to the ring member. A second k-wire or half pin is inserting through a second piece of (broken) bone and the second k-wire is affixed to the first and second adjustable devices. Adjusting at least one of the first and second adjustable devices realigns the broken bone. The dynamic fixator described herein can be used to gradually correct a traumatized bone (i.e., a bone that is broken or fractured). The fixator provides accurate multi axis movement (i.e., movement in two to three different axes-linear, vertical, and angular). This multi axis movement is used in repairing traumatized bone by, for example, realigning two pieces of a traumatized bone. Note: sometimes the wires are not in the broken bones. They may be in healthy bones on either sides of the fractured bones For example, two pieces of a (traumatized) bone can be realigned by bringing the pieces of bone together. The bones are brought together by having a first and second k-wire pass through a first and second piece of the (traumatized) bone and having the first and second k-wires attached to one of a rigid body (e.g., ring element) or an adjustable device wherein the traumatized bone is realigned by moving the adjustable device in at least one axis. More specifically, after passing the first k-wire through the traumatized bone, both the first and second ends of the first k-wire are attached to a ring element. With the first piece of traumatized bone secured, a second k-wire is passed through a second piece of traumatized bone. After passing the second k-wire through the second piece of traumatized bone, the first end of the second k-wire is attached to a first adjustable device and the second end of the second k-wire is attached to a second adjustable device. Keeping the first k-wire attached to the rigid body the second k-wire can be moved in accurate multi axis movement by adjusting the first and second adjustable devices. Moving at least one of the first and second adjustable devices causes the second k-wire to move thereby moving the traumatized bone into a desired position (e.g., proper alignment). In some embodiments, the adjustable device is capable of motion in three different directions. For example, the adjustable device is capable of linear, vertical, and angular motion. In other embodiments, the adjustable device is capable of motion in two different directions. For example, the adjustable device is capable of linear and vertical motion, however, it can not move angularly. It will be apparent that the adjustable device can produce any combination of linear, vertical, and angular motion. Further, although described as having the second k-wire attached to a first and second adjustable device the first end or second end of the second k-wire can be attached to the rigid body. Further still, as an alternative, both the first and the second k-wires can be attached to adjustable devices, the rigid body, or a combination of an adjustable device and the rigid body. Lastly, although depicted as only one or two adjustable devices, any number of adjustable devices can be attached to the rigid body. As used herein when referring to bones or other parts of the body, the term “proximal” means close to the heart and the term “distal” means more distant from the heart. The term “inferior” means toward the feet and the term “superior” means toward the head. The term “anterior” means toward the front part or the face and the term “posterior” means toward the back of the body. The term “medial” means toward the midline of the body and the term “lateral” means away from the midline of the body.",

The sleeve of the species can be largely, freely designed with respect to its outside contour, namely both with respect to diameter, cross sectional shape and shaping in a longitudinal direction, in particular allowing for pronounced outside edges and is not bound to a material-intensive and apparatus-intensive type of manufacture. The sleeve of the present invention produced in accordance with this method is preferably of a material which can be subjected to a super-plastic deformation and can be manufactured in nearly any desired shape, namely with respect to diameter, cross section shape and shape in a longitudinal direction. It can be advantageous produced of two half-shells or from a rolled sheet, which was pre-bent roughly tubular. It is especially advantageous to employ a seamless drawn tube, which is of a material that is already suitable for super-plastic deformation. The sleeve advantageously contains no guides or retaining parts for agent lines and, on the contrary, these are only component parts of separate base members of the instrument onto which the sleeve is slipped. Particularly for the manufacture of outside sleeves of the dental, motor-driven handpieces, it is advantageous to fashion a sleeve of one piece overlapping the drive. When such a hand instrument contains a plurality of sleeves lying in axial succession, then it is advantageous to fashion the sleeve blank of one piece and to separate the individual sleeves from this sleeve blank after the conclusion of the deforming process. An especially advantageous manufacture can be achieved when a plurality of such sleeve blanks containing one or more individual sleeves are manufactured from the raw initial material in an interconnecting succession of a repeating sequence. A plurality of sleeves can, thus, be simultaneously manufactured in one production process. Other advantages and features of the invention will be readily apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiment, the drawings and claims.",

    "abstract": "The present invention aims to alleviate at least one of the above disadvantages and to provide beast restraining apparatus which will be reliable and efficient in use. This invention in one aspect resides broadly in a bail assembly including: bail means moveable between operative engaged positions and a disengaged position; bail actuating means for quickly moving said bail means between said operative engaged positions and said disengaged position, and holding means for holding said bail means at any selected said operative engaged position. The holding means is suitably infinitely variable over at least the engaged positions of the bail means. The bail means may include one fixed bail and one moveable bail but preferably it includes a pair of opposed moveable bails interconnected for movement towards and away from each other. The bail means may be arranged to move in any manner suitable for engaging a beast. For example the bails may be arranged for parallel sliding movement or pivotal movement. Preferably the bail means are arranged so that in a disengaged position the head of a beast may be passed through the gap between the bails and in an engaged position the bail means may clamp against the neck of the beast. The bail actuating means may be an electrically operated device such as a motorised screw or solenoid operative to quickly move the bail means to and from the engaged position upon activation of a power supply. Preferably, however the bail actuating means is an operating handle operatively connected to the bail means so as to move the bail means to the engaged position upon movement of the handle in one direction. The holding means may include a rod or rope operatively connected to the bail means and a clutch adapted to selectively clamp the rod or rope such that the bail means is held in a desired position. Alternatively, the holding means may include a rotary clutch with a pivotable handle allowing movement of the bail means to the engaged position but selectively preventing reverse movement of the restraining means to the disengaged position. Preferably however, the holding means is a hydraulically operated holding assembly which allows passage of hydraulic fluid such as water or oil from a fluid supply to a locking chamber as the bail means is moved to the engaged position and wherein the fluid is selectively prevented from flowing out of the locking chamber so as to hold the bail means in the engaged position. It is preferred that the bail means includes a pair of bail members connected by concertina type hinges to opposed spaced supports. Suitably the bail members extend upwardly for engagement with guide means for guiding the bail members to and from engagement and wherein the guide members restrain only longitudinal movement of the bail members, lateral and vertical movement being controlled and restrained by the hinges. In a preferred form the bail assembly is demountable for supply in knocked-down form and adapted for bolted interconnection of major structural components, especially those that provide additional rigidity to the race walls. It is also preferred that the members of the bail assembly, when disassembled, can be packed into a relatively small package. For this purpose it is preferred that the bail assembly include a pair of opposed support posts adapted to be rigidly interconnected by transverse members providing moment transfer about respective longitudinal race axes between support posts and post rotational support about post axes through bolted connections, each including bolts spaced from these respective axes. Preferably the moment transfer about respective longitudinal race axes is provided by a transverse structure at upper ends of the posts and the rotational support about post axes is provided by a transverse structure at the lower ends of the posts. The upper transverse structure is suitably formed by spaced laterally extending bars which form guides for upward extension of the bail members. The rotational support about post axes fixes the posts against rotational movement such that hinge pivots fixed to the posts and spaced from their respective longitudinal axes will remain in a fixed orientation to enable the concertina type hinge members to hinge across their front faces between operative and inoperative attitudes. The support also relieves such loads from the other said bolted connections. In relation to the bolted connections it is considered that rigid all-welded head bail structures assume crush loads imparted by heavy beasts to the crush walls because of the relative high rigidity of the head bail compared to the crush. This results in overload of the welded joints and their premature failure. It is also preferred that one of the support posts provide a lower mounting for the holding means and an upper pivotal mounting for a translation mechanism able to translate pivotal movement of an operating handle thereon to lateral motion of the bail members, the translation mechanism preferably being connected to the upper ends of the bail members which extend between the guide bars. In a further aspect this invention resides broadly in a method of installing a head bail assembly to an existing race, the method including providing the crush in a knock-down form and bolting the crush components together such that the bolted joints provide moment transfer about respective longitudinal race axes between support posts and post rotational support about post axes through bolted connections, each including bolts spaced from these respective axes. Servicing of such head bail assemblies is also facilitated as parts requiring service may be readily dismantled and sent away for repair. In another aspect this invention resides in a demountable bail assembly generally of the type described above and utilising any suitable form of holding means such as a ratchet mechanism or a hydraulic mechanism as previously described. In yet another aspect this invention resides broadly in a holding assembly including: adjustable holding means; a locking chamber associated with said adjustable holding means which may be filled with fluid to lock said adjustable holding means; control means for controlling flow of fluid from said locking chamber, and",

    "abstract": "According to the present invention, there is provided a method for scanning a body to enable a cross-section thereof to be reconstructed. Such method includes producing, from a point source of penetrating radiation, a fan beam of the type described which has an apical angle α, and which is coplanar with, and passes through, the cross-section. Rotation of the fan beam about a fixed center causes the fan beam to sweep out an area in the plane of the cross-section contained within a circle that is tangent to the extremity of the fan beam most remote from the fixed center. The tangents to such circle passing through the source intersect at an apical angle β. Measuring the intensity of each beam emerging from the area swept out by the fan beam during its rotation enables computation of a representation of the distribution of the absorption coefficients over such area. The improvement in this method comprises the step of selecting the apical angle α such that it is less than the apical angle β. When one extremity of the fan beam passes through the fixed center, the area swept out by the fan beam is a circle whose center coincides with the fixed center and whose periphery is tangent to the other extremity of the fan beam. In such case, the apical angle α of the fan beam is one-half the apical angle β. A fan beam of the type described with an apical angle half that found in a scanner of the type described, when used in accordance with the present invention, will sweep out the same area in one revolution. Moreover, this result is achieved with 50% fewer detectors and associated circuitry. The quality of the reconstructed area can be improved by shifting the fan beam relative to the fixed center, (e.g., by rotating the fan beam about the source until the beams in the new angular position are interleaved with the position of the beams in their former position) and repeating the rotation. When the fixed center lies outside the fan beam, the area swept-out is annular and is defined by concentric circles whose centers coincide with the fixed center and whose peripheries are respectively tangent to the extremities of the fan beam. By sequentially rotating the fan beam about the fixed center and shifting the fan beam relative thereto after each revolution (e.g., by rotating the fan beam about its apex), a circular area of arbitrary size can be swept out by the fan beam after a number of revolutions. Such area is made up of a composite of sub-areas swept out during each revolution of the fan beam; and its size is independent of the apical angle of the fan beam. When used in accordance with the present invention, a fan beam of the type described can be used to scan a head, for example, in one revolution, and a torso in two revolutions. Thus, one piece of equipment, comparable in size to a head scanner of the type described, can be used for either head or torso scans resulting in a more efficient relationship between equipment size and expense relative to capability. The invention also consists in apparatus for carrying out the method described above. Such apparatus includes a movable scanner means having a source of penetrating radiation for producing a fan beam of the type described which has an apical angle α, and which is coplanar with, and passes through, the cross-section of the body. Means are provided for rotating the scanner means about a fixed center for causing the fan beam to sweep out an area in the plane of the cross-section contained within a circle tangent to the extremity of the fan beam most remote from the center. The tangents to such circle passing through the source intersect at an apical angle β. The relationship between the apical angle α and the apical angle β is that the apical angle α is less than the apical angle β. The invention also consists in apparatus for calibrating the detectors of a scanner of the type described, the improvement comprising means for periodically interrupting the beams of the fan beam, and means for calibrating the detectors during the interval in which the beams are interrupted.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates generally to a steerable tip capture TAA delivery system used to deliver stents and stent grafts. This invention relates generally to medical devices and procedures, and more particularly to a method and system of deploying stent-grafts in a vascular system. Prostheses for implantation in blood vessels or other similar organs of the living body are, in general, well known in the medical art. For example, prosthetic vascular grafts formed of biocompatible materials (e.g., Dacron® material or expanded, porous polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing) have been employed to replace or bypass damaged or occluded natural blood vessels. A graft material supported by a framework is known as a stent-graft or endoluminal graft. In general, the use of stent-grafts for treatment or isolation of vascular aneurysms and vessel walls which have been thinned or thickened by disease (endoluminal repair or exclusion) is well known. Many stent-grafts, are “self-expanding”, i.e., inserted into the vascular system in a compressed or contracted state, and permitted to expand upon removal of a restraint. Self-expanding stent-grafts typically employ a wire or tube configured (e.g., bent or cut) to provide an outward radial force and employ a suitable elastic material such as stainless steel or nitinol (nickel-titanium). Nitinol may additionally employ shape memory properties. The self-expanding stent-graft implanted at a particular location is typically configured in a tubular shape with a diameter slightly greater than the diameter of the blood vessel in which the stent-graft is intended to be used. In general, stent-grafts are typically deployed through a minimally invasive intraluminal delivery, i.e., cutting through the skin to access a lumen or vasculature or percutaneously via successive dilatation, at a convenient (and less traumatic) entry point, and routing the stent-graft through the lumen to the site where the prosthesis is to be deployed. Intraluminal deployment in one example is effected using a delivery catheter with coaxial inner tube and sheath, arranged for relative axial movement. The stent-graft is compressed and disposed within the distal end of the sheath proximal to the distal end of the catheter and held by a stent stop or distal stent graft tip capture mechanism attached to a catheter shaft. The catheter is then maneuvered, typically routed though a vessel until the end of the catheter (and the stent-graft contained therein) is positioned in the vicinity of the intended treatment site. The catheter shaft is then held stationary while the sheath of the delivery catheter is withdrawn. The catheter may include a stop or tip capture prevents the stent-graft from moving back as the sheath is withdrawn. As the sheath is withdrawn, the stent-graft is gradually exposed (uncovered—released—deployed) from its proximal end. As the stent-graft is exposed it radially expands so that at least a portion of the exposed stent graft is in substantially conforming surface contact with a portion of the interior of the lumen, e.g., blood vessel wall. In straight vessels, placement of the stent-graft is relatively straightforward. However, in complex vessels, e.g., in the aortic arch or other curved vessel, placement of the stent-graft is complicated by the tendency of the catheter to maintain a straight shape while the surround vessel curves. More particularly, in the aortic arch, the stiffness of the delivery catheter causes the distal tip of the delivery catheter to position itself close to (if not conforming with) the vessel wall at the outer radius of curvature of the aortic arch. This offset positioning (to the outer radius) of the distal tip of the delivery system combined with the effect blood flow forces have on the stent-graft as it is deployed, results in a high likelihood that the stent graft will be deployed asymmetrically. FIG. 1A  shows a stent graft deliver catheter  20  containing a stent graft  22  substantially conforming to the outside radius of curvature of the thoracic aorta  30 . As shown in  FIG. 1B  when the stent graft begins to deploy, the blood flow, shown by the arrow  32 , causes the initial deployment of the bare spring  24  at the proximal end of the stent graft  22  to open unevenly such that the portion of the spring closer to the inner radius of the thoracic arch bends outward (from the centerline of the stent graft) and downward. As a result, the proximal end  26  of the stent graft  22  is not orthogonal to the vessel wall (see  FIG. 1C ). To reiterate, as stent-graft  22  deployment begins, the blood flow (e.g.,  32 ) catches the initially deployed springs (e.g.,  24 ) like a sail of a sail boat and causes some springs and or stent graft portions to bend preferentially in the direction of blood flow. This causes uneven deployment such that the portion of the springs or stent graft closer to the inner radius of curvature of the aortic arch bends out (inward with respect to the radius of curvature as shown in  FIGS. 1B and 1C ) from the stent graft and downward when deployed high in the vessel as shown. As a result, the proximal end of the stent-graft is not deployed orthogonal to the wall of the aortic arch. To correct the initial asymmetrical deployment, the physician typically tries to reposition the stent-graft, which is generally undesirable (as vessel wall abrasion and more extensive injury may result) depending upon the particular stent graft and anatomical geometry involved. Further, due to the repositioning, additional cuff (extender) type stent-grafts may need to be deployed. As described herein: the proximal end of the stent-graft is the end closest to the heart by way of blood flow path whereas the distal end is the end furthest away from the heart as deployed. In contrast and of note, the distal end of the delivery catheter is usually identified to the end that is farthest from the operator (handle) while the proximal end of the catheter is the end nearest the operator (handle). For purposes of clarity of discussion, as used herein, the distal end of the delivery catheter is the end that is farthest from the operator (the end furthest from the handle) while the distal end of the stent-graft is the end nearest the operator (the end nearest the handle), i.e., the distal end of the catheter and the proximal end of the stent-graft are the ends furthest from the handle while the proximal end of the catheter and the distal end of the stent-graft are the ends nearest the handle. However, those of skill in the art will understand that depending upon the access location, the stent-graft and delivery system proximal and distal designations may be consistent or opposite in actual usage. When using femoral artery access the distal ends are opposite in the device and catheter, while when using a brachial artery access they are consistent. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A device and method of deploying a stent-graft in a curved vessel using features of a steerable catheter and a tip release mechanism in one delivery catheter system are provided. The steering mechanism centers the distal tip of the delivery system and thereby a proximal end of the stent-graft in the curved vessel. A sheath of the stent-graft delivery system is retracted to expose the proximal end of the proximal spring of the stent-graft captured in the catheter tip capture mechanism. The stent-graft is held centered in the vessel and a fractional (less than all) portion of the crowns held by the tip capture mechanism are initially released to partially stabilize the stent graft in the curved vessel as it self expands to deploy. After further deployment of the stent-graft, the tension on the delivery system tip steering mechanism is relaxed and crowns of the proximal end of the stent-graft still captured in the delivery system tip capture mechanism are released. By steering the delivery catheter to center the end of the catheter containing the stent-graft prior to deployment and simultaneously using tip capture to prevent uncontrolled outward bending of the proximal spring of the stent graft, the initial deployment of the stent-graft (the proximal edge of it stent graft material) is substantially orthogonal to the axial centerline of the curved vessel at the deployment location. As the initial deployment of the stent-graft is symmetric, the need to reposition the stent-graft after initial deployment may be avoided. Accordingly, the initially deployed stent-graft is accurately placed within the curved vessel and the need to deploy additional stent-grafts is eliminated. These and other features will be more readily apparent from the detailed description set forth below taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",

    "abstract": "It is an object of the invention to basically change the design concept of cleaning apparatus of this category, and to improve it in such a manner that, by avoiding the aforenamed disadvantages, the cleaning apparatus can not only be of a considerably simpler construction but can also simultaneously be of such a compact design that, with the same capacity, it will turn out to be considerably smaller and correspondingly lighter in its weight. This compact design shall not only lower the cost of production, but contribute to such a far-reaching reduction in weight that the apparatus may easily be moved and may even simply be carried by hand at any time. For the solution of this object, the cleaning apparatus as per invention distinguishes itself by the following features: (a) The motor and pump soudings form a common operating space closed to the outside, in which the armature of the electric motor and the rotary drive of the pump are axially offset relative to each other, and carried on a common shaft extending through the operating space. (b) The operating space containing the electric motor and the pump is filled with an electrically nonconductive coolant, which is separated from the cleaning or washing liquid respectively, up to such a level that the pump as well as the electric motor will lie below the level of the coolant. (c) Those parts of the pump through which the cold cleaning or washing liquid circulates, and which are exposed to the coolant, as well as their supply and discharge ports, will form the heat exchanger for the continuous recooling of the coolant. (d) The rotating parts of the pump and/or the electric motor, or the shaft respectively, are provided with means of circulation which will, at least indirectly, cause a continuous forced circulation between cold and heated coolant within the operating space. In this manner it is possible to achieve, with very limited constructional expenditure, a high-capacity spraying unit of compact design and of a moderate constructional weight, resulting therefrom, which will enable easy transporting of the cleaning apparatus by hand. Since the motor and the pump are located in a common operating space closed to the outside, and since the housing parts required therefor are not larger than it is necessitated in any way by the enclosure and the bearings of the motor and the pump, an extremely compact construction will result, which furthermore allows dispensing with additional shrouding. The coolant, contained in the operating space and flowing around the pump as well as the motor, allows herein to subject the electric motor, particularly the squirrel-cage motor, to higher loads even in continuous operation, then would be permissible with the usual air-cooled electric motors. This is ensured on one hand, by subjecting the coolant within the enclosed operating space to continuous forced circulation by means of circulation appurtenant to the rotary components, and, on the other hand by those parts of the pump and its supply and discharge ports which are exposed in the operating space to the coolant forming comparatively large areas of heat exchange surfaces since internally they are impinged by the cool cleaning or washing liquid, with such heat-exchange surfaces which furthermore allow extension within wide limits, if so required, without enlarging the design dimensions or the constructional expenditure. Surprisingly, it has been shown that is it possible to design by the aforenamed means of the invention, a cleaning apparatus of the usual capacity with a water-spray pressure of 200 to 250 bar, of such small dimensions that it will then only be of the height of a commercial water bottle with a liquid content of one liter. In order to generate the aforementioned spraying pressure it has hitherto been necessary to use an electric motor with a rated output of about 5 kilowatt, whereas, availing oneself of all advantages of the design as per invention use can be made of a considerably smaller electric motor with a rated output of 1.5 kilowatt. Besides this comparison of dimensions, the comparison of weights also carries considerable importance. Whilst with conventional cleaning apparatus of the category discussed herein, the electric motor alone, with a rated output of 5 kilowatt already has a weight of 35 kilograms, the complete apparatus as per invention is of a total weight of only 23 kilograms, so that it may be designated as a high-capacity apparatus, easy to handle weight-wise, and, particularly, since it can be carried by hand. It has proved to be preferential to use oil as coolant, especially since in this instance the coolant may concomitantly be used as lubricant for the rotating and moving parts of the pump. Full benefits from the solution as per invention will be obtained when the electric motor, designed as a squirrel-cage motor is underdimensioned as to its rated output, relative to the power requirement of the pump as predicated by the pressure required for the delivered jet; under full load it will be operating close to its pulling-out torque and with a concomitant drop in its rotating speed. This is the case if, instead of the squirrel-cage motor with a rated output of 5 kilowatt, as hitherto required for the same pump capacity, an electric motor with a rated output of only 1.5 kilowatt with correspondingly smaller constructional dimensions is used, which is however, subject to the essential further conditions which must be complied with the invention. Although the pump to be used for the generation of the required jet pressure may be of different designs, it is particularly appropriate to design it as a radial piston pump since it can be adapted in the best possible manner, to the available cross-sectional area of the housing, also if it is of higher capacities, without obtaining the construction being too large in its axial height. In order to improve the forced circulation of the coolant within the operating space of the electric motor and pump so as to best provide a possibly most intensified heat exchange, it may suffice in certain instances to provide vanes for the rotating parts, particularly for those of the electric motor. Instead, or in addition, there may also be advantages as per a suitable development of the invention to achieve forced circulation of the coolant by providing the shaft with an axial suction passage and with at least one cross bore connected to the suction passage. Herein, the shaft may have a passage extending throughout its entire axial length, with cross bores for the throwing off of the coolant arranged diametrically opposed, and located at least at its upper end, and extending above the armature of the electric motor. A deviating solution preferable in some instances consists as per invention in the shaft having a passage channel in the lower longitudinal zone at the level of the pump, the passage being connected in its upper as well as its lower end to at least two diametrically opposed cross bores, wherein the cross bores, located within the height of the pump, are provided with throwing tubes radially projecting outward relative to the outer circumference of the shaft in such a manner, that the upper cross bores will form the suction ports and the nozzles of the throwing tubes will form the discharge ports for the forced circulation of the coolant. The continuous forced circulation within the operating space between coolant that is cold and that which has been heated up in the zone of the electric motor, may be additionally intensified, with the means as quoted by additionally providing more liquid-conducting flow passages within the housing walls of the stator and/or the armature, suitably designed and dimensioned in such a manner that conjointly with means of circulation appurtenant to the rotating parts a continuous circulation movement of the coolant will be ensured, in the direction as desired between the zones of the operating space above and below the electric motors. Although it has been proved to be fully satisfactory to use as heat exchange surface for the heat exchange between the coolant and the cleaning or washing liquid, only the supply lines connecting the pump cylinders to each other and the discharge lines connecting the pump cylinders to each other which lines carry the cleaning or washing liquid. It may be an advantage to artificially enlarge these cooling surfaces which, in the manner described afore, may be anyway available for cooling.",

    "abstract": "The present apparatus is fire control system to be installed at a drilling rig. It is particularly adapted for use at a rig where the well to be drilled will have greater exposer to fire and other hazards of this sort. For instance, if the well is to be drilled through the Tuscalosa Sand which yields extremely high pressure natural gas, this type of equipment would be highly desirable. It is installed either at spudding in or at least in the first or three days of operation. It is installed and left at the rig until the well has been completed. The equipment utilizes spray nozzles which are mounted at selected locations to put out any fire which might occur. Indeed, the equipment is installed, switched on, and operated in a standby mode throughout the drilling interval. When drilling is finished, it can be removed to another drilling location and reused at that location. In particular, the equipment features a standby mode of operation so that it is always ready to operate by delivery a flood of water. Indeed, the delivery rate can be as high as 1200 gallons per minute for fire protection. The equipment features a portable engine and pump which are connected to strategically located nozzles. An engine control unit sets the throttle of the engine at a desired engine speed and is changed to full output in the event of a fire by suitable switches which are located at or on the rig floor. By this approach, the personnel on the rig floor are able to initiate fire protection with minimal time delay. DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The drawing with the present disclosure sets forth the fire protection apparatus of this disclosure installed at a drilling rig and particularly shows how nozzles are positioned at selected locations to protect the major work areas at the rig site. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT Attention is directed to FIG. 1 of the drawings where the numeral 10 identifies a drilling rig. The rig will be described first to provide the context of the present invention which will be described in detail with the understanding that it is placed on a typical drilling rig where fire protection is needed. The drilling rig 10 incorporates an upstanding derrick 12 which is assumed to have four edges which extend upwardly to the crown (not shown). Obviously, the rig can have other types of construction including the typical tilt up rig where the derrick is constructed differently. The numeral 12 identifies a rig floor which supports a drive system connected with a rotary table (not shown). The rig floor is located several feet above the ground and is supported on a support structure 14. The floor is sufficiently high above the structure 14 that there is room beneath the rig floor for the BOP equipment 16. That is normally installed below the rig floor to clamp around the drill pipe. That is, the BOP equipment 16 is installed around the drill pipe. There is a flow pathway downwardly through the drill string for drilling mud which is delivered by a mud pump where the mud circulates downwardly through the drill bit, and flows back up in the well. This return flow is in the annular space on the exterior of the drill pipe and the drilling fluid returns to the surface and is removed to the side for recycling. The drilling mud flow normally directs the mud through various recovery devices such as shale shakers or desanders. In addition, a degasser may also be connected with the mud flow. In any event, the BOP 16 is normally located beneath the rig floor and immediately adjacent to the upper end of the borehole to operate in the intended fashion. The drilling mud is directed through the various pieces of equipment identified at 18 which includes the choke, the shaker, and other mud handling equipment. These are normally deployed in a group, and typically includes two or three mud pits. In particular, there will be a mud pump, the choke and the control equipment for the choke, degasser, desander, or shale shaker. The present apparatus is generally identified by the numeral 20. This equipment is preferably installed somewhat remote from the rig floor 12. In the event of fire, the fire will normally occur at two or three locations and the protective equipment 20 is located remote from these locations to assure that it is clear of the fire so that it can operate to provide fire protection. Thus, the protective equipment 20 is positioned somewhat remote from the BOP 16 and is also remote from the mud handling equipment indicated generally at 18. The present apparatus is ideally portable, at least portable by means of a flatbed trailer, and to this end, it incorporates a skid 22 which supports the pump 24 and a diesel engine 26. These are commonly mounted on a single skid. A second skid is normally included to support a fuel tank 28. The fuel tank 28 provides sufficient fuel for operation for several days, e.g., 7 days. The remainder of the equipment shown in the drawing is relatively small and normally located on the skid 22 as will be detailed. The fire protection equipment utilizes a large water tank 30. Preferably, a closed tank can be used, typically one that holds about 500 barrels of water. Such tanks are routinely available. The tank 30 is provided with an optional heater 32. In northern climates, it may be necessary to add the heater so that the water is sufficiently heated that it does not freeze. Of course, the heater can be omitted should this not be a problem. The tank 30 is connected with a large diameter hose extending to the pump 24. A typical pump provides an output of 1200 gallons per minute with a discharge pressure of about 130 psi. The preferred form of pump is relatively simple, and to this end, a centrifugal pump will suffice. To handle this kind of flow, a flow line 34 is connected from the tank to the pump 24. Typically, the flow line is perhaps a 6 inch suction line. The pump 24 is connected directly to the engine 26. In the preferred form of equipment, both units are mounted on the common skid which is equipped with eyelets at the top so that the skid mounted equipment can be lifted as a unit. A suitable engine is a 6 cylinder diesel provided by Cummings Engine Company, Inc. capable of 177 BHP. This typical engine has an idle speed of about 800 rpm. It has an adjustable throttle which permits it to be set at desired speeds, and in this particular embodiment, it is operated at a continuous speed of perhaps 1500 rpm. Maximum output with peak torque is obtained at about 2500 rpm. More will be noted regarding these throttle settings hereinafter. The skid mounted engine 26 normally requires a specified quantity of lubricating oil in the crank case. A supplemental lube oil supply is finished at 36. In addition, the fuel for the engine 26 is provided by the large tank 28 mounted on a separate skid. The engine is normally operated at one of three speeds. Idle speed was mentioned above and that occurs when the equipment is first switched on. The speed is set to a higher level, perhaps 1200-1500 rpm, by an engine control unit 40. This accomplishes that speed simply by positioning the throttle for operation at a selected speed. The engine control unit adjusts the speed to full power at about 2500 rpm. The engine control unit is provided with a radio receiver 42. When a signal is provided by the receiver 42 to the engine control 40, the engine throttle is moved to the higher speed, namely 2500 rpm. This setting will be described as maximum power output. The engine control unit really has two operative states. One which is at the standby speed, and the other is at maximum power. The engine control unit is also connected with a siren or other alarm device. The siren 44 is included to provide a clear warning to rig personnel including those remote from the rig floor, e.g., those sleeping in temporary quarters nearby. The skid 22 supports a running light 46. The running light is duplicated at two locations. There is one immediately on the skid. It is sufficiently large that it can be viewed even in the darkest of conditions, even when obscured with fog, etc. There is a parallel light 48 which is located on the rig floor. Both lights are operated when the engine 26 is running. This provides a positive signal to personnel that the equipment is operating. The rig floor is the location of two important pieces of equipment involved in the fire protection system 20. One is the running light. It provides the clear indication to personnel on the rig floor that the equipment is successfully operating to provide a fail safe warning. Thus, if the engine 26 stops operating for any reason, the lights 46 and 48 go out and that provides the necessary safety feedback for personnel. Assume for purposes of description that the tool pusher is the person in charge. The tool pusher will watch the running light 48 at all times. In addition to that, the tool pusher is usually adjacent to a switch 50 which connects with the engine control unit 40. That is, the switch can be wired directly to the engine control 40. The switch does not switch the engine control off; rather, it switches the equipment from the standby speed to maximum power operation. The switch 50 is connected by means of a fixed wire which is safely installed out of harms way extending from the rig floor. It is available for operation by the tool pusher at any time. A duplicate switch can be placed on the rig floor if desired so that the driller might also operate the equipment. An alternate mode of asserting control over the fire protection equipment 20 is accomplished by a hand held portable transmitter 52. It is a portable device which communicates with the receiver 42. It provides an alternate signal. The transmitter 52 can be implemented by means of a relative small hand held transmitter which fits in the pocket of a key or selected personnel around the rig. The transmitter 52 can be placed in the pocket of any roughneck anywhere on the rig even up in the derrick, for instance, up on the monkey board. First and second separately located switches can be included for different personnel to operate, e.g., one for the driller, and another for the tool pusher. Also, the alarm devices are at spaced locations. The present equipment utilizes selected nozzles with standpipes. A standpipe 54 supports a nozzle 56 under the rig floor 12 directed at the area of the BOP 16. In similar fashion, a standpipe 58 extends well above the rig floor and supports a nozzle 60 above the rig floor, perhaps 10 feet over the floor. A third standpipe 62 supports a nozzle 64 directed at the choke and other equipment. All three of the nozzles are directed in a fixed direction. All three are provided with an outlet to provide a broad spray as opposed to a narrow stream of water. All three are constructed with the standpipes momentarily or temporarily anchored in position and of sufficient strength to resist the reaction force that arises from operation. All three are connected by means of fire hoses line extending from the three respective standpipes to the pump 24. The pump is provided with an outlet header which connects with the three fire hoses identified at 66, 68, and 70. Deployment of the equipment is accomplished along the lines described hereinabove, namely, at an early point in the drilling routine when the derrick and drilling rig are first installed and the safety equipment of the present disclosure is installed and switched on. The tanks 28 and 36 are filled and the engine is turned on. Of course, the water tank 30 is also filled. It is characteristic of a centrifugal pump that it will not provide an output flow at an idle speed. Accordingly, the hoses 66, 68, and 70 are installed by connection with the pump outlet header and are extended to the respective nozzles deployed as illustrated. These hoses are substantially empty of water at this juncture because the pump 24 has no output flow. By contrast, when the engine 26 is raised to maximum power output, the pump 24 will speed up to provide full suction at the input and will deliver several hundred gallons per minute through the three hoses. The water flows through the hoses and is delivered through the three respective nozzles to form a sprayed fog or mist of substantial water volume directed to the suspect fire areas. Several options can be incorporated in the present apparatus. For instance, the number of nozzles can be varied and additional nozzles can be located as desired. In another modification, a foaming agent can be added to the water either at the tank 30 or otherwise input to the pump 24 along with the flow of water. When the water flow starts, the siren 44 is triggered. This provides an alarm device to all personnel. In addition to that, an important feature is the provision of the signal, typically a visual signal, provided by the running lights 46 and 48. These two signals are useful to assure rig personnel at all times that the equipment is in a ready to operate condition. Obviously, if the fuel tank 28 is emptied and the engine switches off for lack of fuel, the absence of that light is an alarm condition suggesting to rig personnel that they ought to stop drilling and restart that equipment to assure the continued provision of safety at the rig site. The present apparatus can provide a spray of water within about 1.5 seconds of providing the signal. Thus, the switch 50 is operated forming a signal to the engine control unit. This changes the speed of the engine 26 and initiates water pumping from the pump 24. There is only a modest time delay as water is drawn from the tank 30 into the pump 24 and then is delivered through the fire hoses 66, 68, and 70. The 1.5 second time delay is typical where the hoses are approximately equal in length and are approximately 200 feet or less in length. Preferably, the hoses have a nomimal size of 3 inches and the nozzles are compatible for this size. With three hoses and a nominal 3 inch nozzle, approximately 1200 gallons per minute through put can be provided. While the foregoing is directed to the preferred embodiment, the scope is determined by the claims which follow.",
    "full_text": "BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE \n     The process of drilling an oil or gas well is a dangerous process which involves the risk of fire. The risk of fire is particularly well known, but in spite of the high level of risk, fires are relatively few and far between. Nevertheless, they occasionally do happen on or at the drilling rig. The risk of fire is increased during certain drilling circumstances. Specifically, the risk of fire can be increased markedly when the well penetrates a high pressure natural gas formation. In that event, the well may experience a surge in which the high pressure natural gas flows up the well borehole during drilling. For that reason, the normal, safe operating procedures require that the well be protected by filling the well with a heavy weight drilling fluid, normally known as drilling mud. The drilling fluid is placed in the well to maintain a column of fluid acting on the formation which overcomes the gas pressure. This prevents a surge of natural gas from f...",

    "abstract": "The field of the present invention relates to implantable devices. The invention also relates to the field of methods for controlling pH, particularly through the use of implantable devices that regulate the surrounding pH. Methods for preparing an implantable device are also related to the field of the present invention. Additional methods for enhancing the biocompatibility of an implantable device are also disclosed. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Biodegradable polymers, such as those belonging to the family of polylactic acid (PLA) and polyglycolic acid (PGA), are widely used for fabricating implantable devices. Such devices are currently used for drug delivery, joint resurfacing (using allograft chondrocytes and synthetic polymer scaffolds), and fracture fixation in medicine, particularly in the fields of orthopaedics, podiatry and maxillofacial surgery. The degradation of these materials has been studied both in vivo and in vitro. It has been reported that they degrade primarily by hydrolysis of ester bonds. Upon degradation, these materials release acidic by-products, which then enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle and are reduced to carbon dioxide and water. Basic substances, such as calcium carbonate and hydroxyapatite, have been described to some extent in the literature in a variety of applications. For example, Kampner describes a permanent joint prosthesis having a biodegradable anchor of glycolic acid and polylactic acid polyesters with calcium carbonate and hydroxyapatite. The Fong et al. patent 5  employs sodium hydroxide in microspheres, the sodium hydroxide providing for the regulation of microsphere core material release. The Kampner patent 6  refers to hydroxyapatite in polymeric bone implants, and Allmann et al. 7  refers to enhancing drug loading efficiency of PLA nanoparticles by using a savoxepine base and modifying the pH of an aqueous base. Basic substances thus have been used to increase drug loading efficiency or to increase the solubility of an active ingredient. Several studies have reported on the effects of pH change during biodegradable polymer breakdown. For example, Younes et al. 8  reports a relatively greater polymer mass loss with increasing pH. Other investigators in the area of biodegradable implantable materials have raised questions about the biocompatibility and toxicity of biodegradable polymer breakdown products 1-3 . For example, Bostman et al. reported aseptic sinus formation with biodegradable implants used to repair fractures in humans. Lowered pH in the vicinity of an implantable device from breakdown of PLA and PGA breakdown has also been suggested to cause adverse effects like inflammation and tissue damage 2 ,3. However, changes in pH that occur in vivo with polymer implant degradation have not been reported to significantly affect physiological levels of blood components. For example, Vasenius et al. 10  report &#34;normal&#34; results for blood components and acid base balance in vivo with implanted rods of the biodegradable polymers poly lactic acid or poly D, L lactic acid. Solving the problem of controlling pH shifts due to polymer breakdown products would improve the biocompatibility of a variety of implantable devices for both short term and long term use in the medical industry. A method for controlling pH would also be useful in other industries where pH changes from polymer degradation present a problem. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The above and other needs are met in the disclosed devices. Many of the problems associated with shifts in pH due to biodegradable polymer breakdown products are in part remedied by the compositions and methods of the present invention. The inventors have found that the inclusion of a pH regulating substance, such as an alkaline substance, an acidic substance, or a buffering agent, included with the biodegradable polymer, will hinder shifts in pH that typically occur as the polymer breaks down. By including a pH-controlling material with the polymer itself, the life of the device may also be prolonged. This technique will also guard against a variety of pH-related in vivo side effects associated with pH shifts at implantation sites. These advantages and others are realized according to the various compositions and methods provided in the present invention. It is also contemplated that the implantable devices of the invention having a pH-regulating material may be used as scaffolds for joint resurfacing. In this aspect, primary or passaged cells, such as mesenchymal stem cells or chondrocytes, are cultured on discs of biodegradable polymer scaffolds that include a pH-controlling substance. Such scaffolds can have the form of nonwoven mesh of PGA fibers 12 to 14 μm in diameter, with the mesh being 0.1 to 0.2 cm thick, a bulk density of 55-65 mg/cm 3  and a void volume of 92-96%. The resulting scaffold may be used as an implant. Techniques for preparation and use of polymer scaffolds, which do not contain pH regulating substances of this invention, are described in Freed et al., &#34;Joint Resurfacing Using Allograft Chondrocytes and Synthetic Biodegradable Polymer Scaffolds,&#34; Journal of Biomedical Materials Research, Vol. 28, 891-899 (1994) and Freed et al., Biodegradable Polymer Scaffolds for Tissue Engineering,&#34; Biotechnology, Vol. 12, (July, 1994), incorporated herein by reference. Another aspect of the invention provides a method for minimizing tissue damage related to adverse pH changes from the presence of polymer breakdown products. Still another aspect of the invention provide a technique for enhancing implant biocompatibility. Because a pH controlling agent, such as an alkaline, acidic, or buffering substance, is included with the polymer, it is released at a rate that is proportional to the rate at which the polymer degrades. Potential changes in pH, such as from increases in acidity related to break down of polylactic or polyglycolic acid, may thus be offset by the release of an alkaline substance included with the polymer. In another aspect, the invention provides a method for inhibiting sudden pH shifts surrounding a biodegradable polymer implant. By way of example, one particular embodiment of the method comprises preparing a mixture of a pH controlling substance and a biodegradable polymer, forming an implantable device with the mixture, and placing the device in contact with an environment that will degrade the biodegradable polymer. One example of such an environment would be that surrounding the implant of the device after implantation in the tissue of an animal. The pH regulating effects of the invention may also be realized by placing the device in contact with a culture of cells or in a biological fluid. Because the pH-controlling substance of the device is released as the polymer degrades, shifts in the pH surrounding the polymer will be inhibited, and therefore a relatively constant pH may be achieved. In addition, because an increase in pH surrounding a polymer has been reported to increase polymer mass loss, it is expected that the usable life of devices fashioned and used according to the present invention will be prolonged. These features will thus enhance the scope of application of these and other polymer-based orthopaedic implantable devices, as well as implants employed for the delivery of pharmacologically active substances. In a further aspect, the invention provides a method for enhancing surface porosity of an implant comprising removing at least part of an impermeable covering film or &#34;skin&#34; from at least one surface of the implant. The removal of part or all of the covering or &#34;skin&#34; may be accomplished by many different techniques. By way of example, such may be achieved by cutting away the entire skin covering of a device using a metal implement having a sharp edge of a size sufficient to remove the outer layer of the device at once. As used in the description of this method, the term &#34;covering&#34; is defined as an impermeable or semi-permeable skin, membrane, or film that partially or completely impedes the egress and/or ingress of substances. Removal of the &#34;skin&#34; or other covering from at least one surface will thus provide a simple and inexpensive method of enhancing surface porosity. The described polymeric &#34;skin&#34; or layer often forms at the surface of a polymeric cylinder or other device. Alkaline substances, acidic substances and buffering agents constitute particular classes of pH-controlling substances of the invention. Many different alkaline and acidic agents, as well as salts thereof, may be employed in conjunction with the biodegradable polymer. Alkaline agents are preferably non-toxic and suitable for combination with a biodegradable polymer, such as polylactic acid, polyglycolic acid, polycaprolactone, copolymers thereof, or mixtures thereof. By way of example, alkaline agents that may be used in the practice of the invention include calcium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, calcium hydroxyapatite, and/or salts of these substances. In addition, any combination of these and other alkaline substances or their salts may be used. In some particular embodiments, the alkaline agent is sodium bicarbonate or salts thereof. Acidic agents may also be incorporated into a biodegradable polymer in the practice of the present invention. Of course, acidic agents that are non-toxic and amenable to mixture with a biodegradable polymer are preferred. Where the particular polymer produces breakdown products with an overall acidic nature, alkaline pH controlling substances would be incorporated into the polymer to provide the pH regulating effect described herein. By way of example, biodegradable polymers that produce relatively acidic breakdown products include polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid. In particular embodiments, the biodegradable polymer of the claimed method is a copolymer of polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid, such as in a 50%/50% copolymer of polylactic acid and polyglycolic acid. Other biodegradable polymers that yield breakdown products with a relatively acidic character include polycaprolactone. In these embodiments, an alkaline or alkaline releasing substance would be included with the polymer. In some embodiments, this alkaline substance is sodium bicarbonate, and is included with the polymer in an amount sufficient to achieve alkaline material release commensurate with the rate of acidic polymer degradation product. The result is an effective prevention of wide pH variation in the environment directly surrounding the polymeric device.",

    "abstract": "The present invention comprises the provision of stable, water insoluble quaternary ammonium salts. For the sake of convenience these compositions will be discussed with respect to the amine portion and the carrier portion used in the formation of these compositions. As will be seen in the discussion of the preferred embodiments, however, chemically speaking an interchangeability of groups in fact exists. The novel compositions of the present invention are produced by activating a carrier, for example polymeric resin, to provide a labile center thereon which will react with a tertiary or bistertiary amine to provide a stable, water insoluble, quaternary ammonium salt. The anion of said salt may be the anion of any physiologically acceptable acid. Such a designation is one of desirability rather than criticality since the &#34;anion leakage&#34; of these compounds is minimal. The compositions of the present invention have the following general structure: ##STR1## R 1  and R 2  are alkyl, alkenyl or cycloalkyl or, taken with the nitrogen to which they are attached are a heterocycle. R 3  where present is alkyl, alkaryl, aralkyl or aryl, Q is the carrier moiety bonded to the ammonium nitrogen, a is an integer corresponding to the number of ammonium moieties per carrier moiety, x is the counterion of any physiologically acceptable acid having valence n, wherein n is an integer.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to specific applications of the aforementioned discovery, in which immunizing commensals are based on Scytalidium sp. or Trichoderma sp. The commensals are prepared by inoculating grain with the microorganism, incubating the mixture, and then recovering spores of the microorganism. The present invention may be used, inter alia, to control soil-borne pathogens such as Phomopsis viticola, Armillaria, Fusarium, Phomopsis sclerotioides, Phoma beta, and Pythium as well as the pathogen causing onion smut. Other pathogens to which Scytalidium or Trichoderma are antagonistic, can also be controlled, as will be hereinafter described. In connection with the speciation of Trichoderma, it should be noted that Trichoderma is one of the most common soil fungi the world over, and has been studied on and off since the 1930&#39;s. It has never been found to accumulate in the environment for any length of time, in spite of determined efforts to do so, because the normal population of Trichoderma is held in check by naturally occurring predators. The classification of Trichoderma species has been the subject of scientific debate for a number of years. Bisby and Rifai represent two distinct viewpoints. The former argues that only the genus Trichoderma is significant (since the various &#34;species&#34; appear to mutate from one to another), and lumps all of the species under Trichoderma viride; Rifai claims that there are more or less distinct specie &#34;aggregates&#34; under the genus Trichoderma. The correctness of either view depends on the culture medium used. Under laboratory conditions, using artificial or semi-natural culture media, Rifai&#39;s aggregates are relatively stable. Under natural conditions they are not, and Bisby&#39;s viewpoint is more realistic. A method of counteracting and controlling the harmful effects of Phomopsis viticola and Botrytis in grapes; of Ceratocystis ulmi in elm trees; of Fusarium in pink; of Phomopsis sclerotioides in cucumbers; of Armillaria and Fomes annosus in spruce and forest pine; of Armillaria (rot) in grapes and fruit trees; of Lentinus lepideus in pine poles, such as utility poles; of smut in onion beds; of Phoma beta and Pythium ultimum in sugar beet seeds; and of Stereum, Ceratocystis, Poria, and Verticillium, comprises administering an effective amount of the commensal to the afflicted plant in a suitable manner. As described below, the immunizing commensal may be administered to trees as pellets inserted into the trunk of the tree. The immunizing commensal may also be administered to plants as a powder, a spray, or as a tablet. The mixture in which the immunizing commensal is administered should contain nutrients and protective metabolites which allow the immunizing commensals to become established in the host to be protected. Most conveniently such a mixture may be obtained by culturing the immunizing commensal on a solid substrate, such as grains. After the cultured immunizing commensal has reached a suitable level of growth, the solid substrate is then pulverized to prepare a powder. In the case of an organism such as Trichoderma or Scytalidium, the powder typically will contain at least 10 6  spores of grams dry weight. The partially digested growth medium which becomes an inherent part of this substrate provides the requisite nutrient, while the metabolites which resulted from culturing, and which remain in the powder, provide a protective environment for the beneficial organism. Generally, it has been found that Trichoderma exhibit antagonism to the foregoing organisms. However, some are more effective than others, the effectiveness depending on climatic conditions, and the organism to be controlled. For specific applications the techniques of identifying and culturing the optimum strain involving established cross-plating procedures, are well described in the publications and patents identified above, particularly my U.S. patent application Ser. No. 883,272 filed March 3, 1978. Preferred organisms are Scytalidium lignicola ATCC 16,675, Trichoderma polysporum Rifai ATCC 20,475 Trichoderma viride sensu Bisby ATCC 20,476 and Trichoderma viride sensu Bisby, Strain CG/BINAB-INRA 1 030 (Pasteur Institute). Mixtures of these organisms, particularly mixtures of Trichoderma strains, are frequently desirable to provide finished products effective over a range of conditions. For example, at lower temperature, i.e., below about 10° C., Trichoderma polysporum is frequently more effective than Trichoderma viride. At higher temperature, the converse is true. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, immunizing commensals of Scytalidium or Trichoderma containing at least 50×10 6  spores/gram, dry basis, are applied to plants as follows to treat the following afflictions of plants: treating pink to control Fusarium; treating cucumber to control Phomopsis sclerotioides; treating seeds of spruce and forest pine to control Armillaria and Fomes annosus; treating grapevines and fruit trees against Armillaria (rot); treating elm trees against Ceratocystis ulmi; treating wooden poles, e.g., pine poles, to control Lentinus lepideus; treating onion seeds to control smut; coating sugar beet seeds to control Phoma beta and Pythium ultimum; treating grapes to control Botrytis and Phomopsis viticola; control of conifer rust with Scytalidium; and treating Stereum, Ceratocystis, Poria, and Verticillium.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to a template for the surgical implantation of needles into a patient&#39;s body, and more specifically to a template for implantation of needles for prostate brachytherapy. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Various forms of cancer are treated by exposing cancerous tissues to controlled doses of radiation. One technique for delivering a dose of radiation to cancerous tissue is brachytherapy. Brachytherapy is a procedure that involves the implantation of radioactive sources in or near cancerous tissue in order to apply a desired dose of radiation. By implanting a radioactive source in or near targeted cancerous tissue, the desired radiation dose can be delivered, while limiting radiation exposure to other tissues. Brachytherapy which utilizes needles containing one or more radioactive sources to deliver the desired radiation dose into a patient is known to be an effective technique for treating prostate cancer. In administering brachytherapy, a doctor will formulate a three dimensional dosimetry pattern for the placement of radioactive sources within a cancerous organ. In the seed implantation form of brachytherapy, radioactive “seeds” are discharged within the targeted cancerous organ via one or more hollow needles in accordance with the predetermined dosimetry pattern and these seeds are left inside the patient to deliver the desired radiation dosage. The implanted seeds are left within the patient to continue to deliver radiation even after the patient leaves the hospital. The level of radioactivity of the implanted seeds then gradually deteriorates until it becomes insignificant. Another brachytherapy technique is to insert into and remove from a patient more intense radioactive sources in a timed pattern via hollow needles inserted into a target region. This technique, known as high dose rate brachytherapy (“HDR”) delivers a desired dosage in a short amount of time, but avoids permanently implanting radioactive seeds. During an HDR treatment a timed pattern of intense radioactive sources are inserted and retracted through the needles over several minutes. This technique requires that the brachytherapy needles remain in the patient for many hours while a series of HDR treatments are administered. For brachytherapy to have its desired effect it is important that a doctor be capable of precisely placing the brachytherapy needles into the patient. Needles are placed using a template which includes a grid of needle holes. Each needle hole on the grid may be uniquely identified by its own vertical and horizontal coordinates. It is intended that such a needle template be maintained at a constant position with respect to the patient&#39;s body surface and the cancerous organ. Thereby the preplanned dosimetry pattern may be implemented by inserting the needles through their designated coordinates on the template and into the patient. In conjunction with a needle template, an ultrasound device is used to monitor the placement of the needles. In the case of prostate brachytherapy treatment, the ultrasound device is inserted into the rectum of the patient. During treatment, the needle template may be directly mounted on the ultrasound device to maintain a constant relative position between them. The needle template can also be sutured in place on the patient&#39;s body. Once the needles have been inserted into the patient, it is desirable to provide a locking mechanism in the template to hold the needles in place so that the needle insertion depth will not change unintentionally. A conventional design for a locking mechanism is to make the template from a “sandwich” of three plates through which the needle holes extend. In this design, the outer and inner plates are fixedly positioned with respect to one an other and the middle plate moves slidably in a vertical direction between the two outer plates. Once the needles have been inserted through the template as desired, the needles are locked by turning a screw to apply vertical force to the middle plate thereby causing the middle plate to apply a vertical force to the needles in the template, preventing their unintentional movement. For prostate brachytherapy, needles are inserted through the perineum of a patient to deliver a radioactive source to a cancerous prostate gland. To perform this procedure the patient is placed in thelithotomy position. The needle template is supported in a vertical upright position so that the needles may be inserted into the patient on a flat horizontal plane. In attempting to maintain a constant position of the template relative to the patient during prostate brachytherapy, the template is sutured to the patient&#39;s skin in the perineum region. To support the template in place relative to the perineum, and to allow the sutures to be made, the template is rested in close contact with the surface of the perineum. However, it is difficult to secure the known templates in place as these are generally square or rectangular and flat on the front and back surfaces. Flat templates are inconsistent with the shapes of patients&#39; perineums. In an attempt to address this problem, the gaps between the skin of the patient and the template have been stuffed with material such as gauze. However, such gauze stuffing is often irregular and can result in a cleanliness problem as the stuffing absorbs blood. Also, gauze stuffing may interfere with making a good suture of the template to the patient. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a brachytherapy needle template comprising an inclined and/or curved support backing conforming to a shape of a part of the patient&#39;s body. This support backing includes suturing eyelets which, when the device is in an operative position, are located adjacent to the patient&#39;s skin. This inclined and/or curved support backing allows the needle grid portion of the template to remain vertical when placed against the patient so that the needles may be inserted horizontally. The present invention is further directed to a needle lock mechanism for holding the needles in place once they have been inserted into a patient. The needle lock mechanism comprises an arrangement of two plates, one of which moves slidably with respect to the other wherein the movable plate slides within a vertical channel formed, for example, by placing horizontal pins in a portion of the support backing. After the brachytherapy needles have been placed through the plates, a vertical force is placed on the movable plate and the force on the movable plate locks the needles in place.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to methods and apparatus for the medical treatment of disease of the heart. More particularly, this invention relates to a method and apparatus for treating cardiac arrhythmias by ablating in a vicinity of pulmonary venous tissue. 2. Description of the Related Art Tissue ablation from the inner walls of hollow viscera of the body generally, and the vascular system in particular, has been found to be useful in the treatment of various medical conditions. Technological developments in intravascular catheters, manipulative instruments adapted to intravascular catheters, and catheter localization techniques have especially benefited the field of cardiology. Percutaneous transcatheter ablation has been used successfully in the treatment of conduction defects and arrhythmias of various types. Today, atrial tachyarrhythmias are a common application for ablative therapy. Various ablative modalities have been employed in the past, such as ablation by direct heating. Energy can be conducted to the target tissue using various modalities, such as ultrasound, laser, resistive heating, and radiofrequency energy. One ablative approach is the so-called “maze” technique. In general, the maze procedure attempts to block abnormal conduction patterns in the left atrium by establishing a maze-like pattern of linear lesions in the left atrial wall. Atrial arrhythmias are known to be associated with abnormal electrical activity of tissue foci in the vicinity of the pulmonary veins, especially the superior pulmonary veins. Various ablative treatments of such foci have been attempted. For example, the production of linear atrial lesions by radiofrequency ablation, in combination with ablation of suspected arrhythmogenic foci has been performed using transcatheter techniques. More recently, circumferential lesions at or near the ostia of the pulmonary veins have been created to treat atrial arrhythmias. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,012,457 and 6,024,740, both to Lesh, disclose a radially expandable ablation device, which includes a radiofrequency electrode. Using this device, it is proposed to deliver radiofrequency energy to the pulmonary veins in order to establish a circumferential conduction block, thereby electrically isolating the pulmonary veins from the left atrium. U.S. Pat. No. 5,468,239 to Tanner et al. describes a circumferential laser assembly, adapted, for example, to be placed in the urethral canal such that a transurethral resection of benign prostatic hypertrophy may be performed. Radiofrequency ablation using multiple contiguous circumferential points, guided by electro-anatomical mapping is proposed in the document,  Circumferential Radiofrequency Ablation of Pulmonary Vein Ostia: A New Anatomic Approach for Curing Atrial Fibrillation , Pappone C, Rosanio S, Oreto G, Tocchi M, Gugliotta F, Vicedomini G, Salvati A, Dicandia C, Mazzone P, Santinelli V, Gulletta S, Chierchia S, Circulation 102:2619-2628 (2000). It is emphasized that particular care must be exercised to ensure that the ablation sites are indeed contiguous; otherwise irregular electrical activity in the pulmonary vein may continue to contribute to atrial arrhythmia. It has also been proposed to produce circumferential ablative lesions using ultrasound energy delivered via a cylindrical ultrasound transducer through a saline-filled balloon. This technique is described in the document,  First Human Experience With Pulmonary Vein Isolation Using a Through - the - Balloon Circumferential Ultrasound Ablation System for Recurrent Atrial Fibrillation , Natale A, Pisano E, Shewhik J, Bash D, Fanelli R, MD; Potenza D; Santarelli P; Schweikert R; White R; Saliba W; Kanagaratnam L; Tchou P; Lesh M, Circulation 102:1879-1882 (2000). Ablation times in the order of 2 minutes are reported. A known drawback in the use of ultrasound energy for cardiac tissue ablation is the difficulty in controlling the local heating of tissue. There are tradeoffs between the clinical desire to create a sufficiently large lesion to effectively ablate an abnormal tissue focus, or block an aberrant conduction pattern, and the undesirable effects of excessive local heating. If the ultrasound device creates too small a lesion, then the medical procedure could be less effective, or could require too much time. On the other hand, if tissues are heated excessively then there could be local charring effects due to overheating. Such overheated areas can develop high impedance, and may form a functional barrier to the passage of heat. The use of slower heating provides better control of the ablation, but unduly prolongs the procedure. In consideration of these, and other factors, it is appropriate, in designing a practical energy emitter, to consider the amplitude of the energy signal, the amount of time required for the energy application, the size of the emitter, and the contact area, as well as ease of positioning, withdrawal, and repositioning of the device so as to be able to conveniently produce multiple lesions during the same medical procedure. Previous approaches to controlling local heating include the inclusion of thermocouples within the electrode and feedback control, signal modulation, local cooling of the catheter tip, and fluid assisted techniques, for example perfusion of the target tissue during the energy application, using chilled fluids. Typical of the last approach is Mulier, et al. U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,395. Publications which describe various medical techniques of interest include: Scheinman M M, Morady F.

    "abstract": "It is an object of this invention to overcome the disadvantages of prior art golf swing training devices by providing an inexpensive golf swing training apparatus which guides a person&#39;s golf club in the correct physical swing plane during a golf swing, and which further provides the golfer with an analysis of additional golf swing characteristics. In another one of its objects, the present invention provides a golf swing training device which permits substantially, instantaneous comparison of a characteristic of the user&#39;s golf club swing to that of a previous or preferred golf club swing. Another object is to provide a golf swing training apparatus which permits rapid, precise calibration of the golf club swing guide for each individual user. Another object is to provide a golf swing training apparatus which assists the user in developing the proper swing motion for use with a number of different golf clubs. Accordingly, the present invention provides a golf swing training apparatus having a frame with a base for sitting on the ground. An arcuate, or other known golf club swing guide is attached to the frame for guiding a person&#39;s swing by physically limiting movement of the club such that the golf club contacts the golf swing guide as it travels therealong. A device which senses a particular characteristic of the golf club swing is incorporated within the golf club training apparatus. The sensing device is connected to a microprocessor, or the like, to provide the user with an output of the sensed characteristic. The various characteristics of the golf swing which may be analyzed, include the tempo of the swing, the distance the club traveled on the golfer&#39;s backswing or follow-through, angular distance the golf club travels away from the plane of the club swing guide, or other similar features of the club movement. In one preferred embodiment, the sensor device is used to produce a data signal representative of the golfer&#39;s swing tempo. The sensor device comprising a number of individual induction type sensors, which are located at spaced locations within the golf club swing guide. Each sensor sequentially provides the processor with sensor readings as the club or club shaft passes thereby. The processor converts the sensor readings into an output representative of the golf swing tempo or club speed as it moves through individual parts of the swing path. The number and configuration of the sensors within the golf swing guide varies depending on the degree of accuracy which is to be achieved, and the overall cost of the golf swing training apparatus. To analyze a particular golfer&#39;s swing, the golfer stands in the training apparatus and swings his golf club in a known manner. On each of the swing backstroke, downstroke and follow-through the club slides along the swing guide sequentially activating each of the sensors. Preferably, the microprocessor instantaneously converts the timing between sequential sensor readings which are received from the induction sensors, into a graphically displayed output. Output displayed in this manner provides the golfer with substantially immediate feedback of the tempo of his golf swing. As such, the golfer may immediately repeat his swing correcting any deficiencies in swing motion. If desired, the tempo of the user&#39;s swing may also be compared with the tempo of a prerecorded swing stored in the memory of the microprocessor. The prerecorded swing may be the user&#39;s previous or best swing, a computer generated average of the user&#39;s previous swings, a preferred golf club swing executed by a professional golfer, or any other desired swing. The training apparatus is not restricted to teaching the proper swing motion for woods, and may also be used to establish correct swing motion for all golf clubs including pitching wedges, sand wedges and putters. In a more preferred embodiment, the golf swing training apparatus is adjustable in height and angular position to accommodate a number of individual users. Frame members which are movable by means of an electric motor may be used in the adjustment of the golf swing guide. The electric motor is controlled by the microprocessor so as to move the golf swing training apparatus quickly and precisely to a pre-set position selected for each individual user. In a first aspect, this invention resides in a golf swing training apparatus comprising: a frame, a golf club swing guide attached to said frame, said golf club swing guide for guiding a person&#39;s swing, the improvement wherein, said golf club swing guide including sensing means, said sensing means for generating a first set of data signals upon sensing movement of a golf club thereby during said person&#39;s swing, said first set of data signals representative of a characteristic of said person&#39;s golf club swing, and computing means, said computing means having processing means for processing said first set of data signals for generating an output signal. In another aspect, the invention resides in a method of analyzing a golf swing using a golf swing training apparatus comprising a frame, a golf club swing guide for guiding a person&#39;s golf swing, attached to said frame; said golf club swing guide including a plurality of sensors for generating a first set of data signals upon sensing movement of a golf club thereby during said person&#39;s swing, said first set of data signals representative of the tempo of said person&#39;s swing, and a microprocessor including storage for storing a second set of data signals, said second set of data signals being representative of the tempo of a prerecorded golf club swing, said microprocessor having processing means for processing said sets of data signals for generating output signals, said method comprising the steps of swinging said golf club along said golf club swing guide to generate said first set of data signals, and comparing an output signal generated from said first set of data signals with an output signal generated from said second set of data signals.",

    "abstract": "In the game of golf, it is extremely important to keep the clubs free from interference. The slightest debris can alter a well placed shot a few degrees, and depending on the club this could be anywhere from a few to hundreds of feet. The present spectrum of devices and brushes that are available to golf consumers are inaccurate and usually consume valuable time in application. The use of dampened towels to clean one&#39;s clubs usually causes a golfer to lose his/her grip on respective clubs during the next shot of play; existing brushes must be forcefully applied numerous times, hindering the grip of the golfer&#39;s next shot. Other products provide a singular mechanical brush in which the golfer must, once again, push the device back and forth to attain the desired spotless club head. Those inventions requiring water, in most cases, will affect the golfer&#39;s grip, even if only the slightest touch of water moistens the golfer&#39;s hand. A module based mechanism in which a golfer merely presses a button to deep clean an entire club head simultaneously and effortlessly does not exist. With this module, there is no need for constant washing, exchanging of cleaning agents, or physical exertion, all of which can affect the next shot of play. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Based on the problems associated with present club cleaning products, the &#34;Club Cleaner&#34; invention resolves these problems by cleaning the entire club head without requiring any physical exertion on the part of the golfer. The invention described below will be used to economically and efficiently clean club heads, portions of the shaft, and deep clean the club grooves by simply inserting a club head into the module, whose area of cleanability is larger than the entire conventional club head. The following disclosures support the Club Cleaner invention, whose purpose is to enhance the play of golfers by providing them with clean clubs after every shot of play. After each stroke, the player can utilize the hand held device which is easily accessible when attached to any existing golf bag. The player then inserts the club head into the module and begins operation by depressing the On/Off button. The micro-motor, powered by rechargeable batteries, with the help of gearing technology, initiates the rotating bristles to deep clean the club head. The Club Cleaner invention cures the existing problems; it takes the cleaning responsibility completely out of the golfer&#39;s hands. There is no need to wet down clubs, brush furiously with plain brushes, or scrub them clean after each round of play. The cleaning process will take a few seconds after each shot and will leave any given club clean for the next shot of play. The rechargeable Club Cleaner module provides 180-degree cleaning to the face and sides of the club head. The entire club head is cleaned simultaneously, with multiple sets of rotating brushes, while the debris is channeled through the Club Cleaner module out through a designated exit hole.",

    "abstract": "My present invention provides two novel modes of administration of treatment media for treating headache and functional extraocular and intraocular myotendinitis, as distinct from infectious, e.g., viral, bacterial or fungal extraocular and intraocular myotendinitis, or from an auto-immune disease or other systemic disease. The term &#34;headache&#34; is used herein to denote all eye-related headaches derived either from extraocular or an intraocular myotendinitis, and/or certain other categories of headache including vascular headache, non-eye-related tension headache and trigeminal neuralgia. The term &#34;ocular&#34; is used herein in its broadest acceptation to denote the outer tunic of the human eye and all parts of the human eye contained therein. The term &#34;intraocular myotendinitis&#34; is used herein to denote myotendinitis, myositis or fascitis (ed.g., inflamed or otherwise painful conditions) of the internal tissues of the human eye located within the ciliary body including the ciliary muscle(s) and ciliary tendon and any tissue attached thereto. The term &#34;extraocular myotendinitis&#34; is used herein to denote myotendinitis, myositis, fascitis (e.g., inflamed or otherwise painful conditions) of the external tissues of the human eye located between the outer tunic of the eyeball and the bony orbit thereof). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of my present invention to provide novel methods of treatment for headache, and for functional extraocular and intraocular myotendinitis. It is another object of my present invention to provide methods of treatment which achieve the above object, and do so with great rapidity. It is a further object of my present invention to provide methods of treatment which achieve at least the first abovesaid object and include the testing of the binocular status of the patient&#39;s eyes in a plurality of different directions of gaze. Other objects of my present invention will in part be obvious and will in part appear hereinafter. My present invention, accordingly, comprises the several steps and the relation of one or more of such steps to each of the others, all as exemplified in the following disclosure, and the scope of my invention will be indicated in the appended claims. A principal feature of my present invention is the novel mode of eye-related headache and functional ocular myotendinitis treatment of my present invention which takes advantage of the fact that the ophthalmic vein and artery communicate with cerebral blood vessels which are sometimes said to be the site or sites of certain types of headache, e.g., vascular headaches. Since this access route to said cerebral blood vessels bypasses the blood-brain barrier, treatment media can be delivered to said cerebral blood vessels via this route without being blocked by the blood-brain barrier. Another principal feature of my present invention is my discovery that certain steroidal drugs can be delivered to said cerebral blood vessels via this route, which originates at the surfaces of the eyes and proceeds via the conjunctival blood vessels, as witnessed by the fact that these drugs, when so administered, substantially or completely relieve headaches of the type which are associated in the literature with said cerebral blood vessels. I believe that non-steroids (NSAIDS), and possibly anti-migraine drugs (vasoconstrictors, beta-blockers, and calcium channel blockers) may also be deliverable to these headache sites, and particularly to the anterior cerebral artery, by the delivery route of my invention. It is to be understood that said first novel mode of headache treatment media delivery is a principal feature of my present invention. Said second novel mode of headache and myotendinitis treatment, which takes advantage of the conjunctival blood vessels and their interconnections to extraocular myotendinous tissue, also takes advantage of the interconnection of the ophthalmic blood vessels and said cerebral blood vessels, is also a principal feature of my present invention, and will now be described in detail. It is also to be understood that this second novel mode of treatment of my present invention, which is another principal feature of my invention, is in some ways more significant than the above-described first mode, in that it directly addresses the cause of the type of headache associated with said cerebral arteries, i.e., extraocular myotendinitis, and is not simply palliative. For a fuller understanding of the nature and objects of the present invention reference should be had to the following detailed description, taken in connection with the accompanying drawings.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to knee support and treatment devices, and more particularly to a dynamic patella brace for stabilizing the patella to prevent patella subluxation, chondromalacia and other symptomatic conditions of the extensor mechanism during all normal degrees of knee flexion and extension, utilizing a patella force device which applies a medial force on the patella which force dynamically more faithfully tracks vertical and horizontal movement of the patella. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is well known that loosely ligamented individuals, as well as individuals with certain peculiar anatomic features of certain components of the knee, frequently develop various pathological problems with their knees, particularly when these individuals are active in physically strenuous activities, such as, for example, athletics. The most commonly occurring problems relate to stretching or tearing of various knee ligaments, injury to the cartilage (meniscal) and articular surfaces of the knee joint, and fractures. Patella subluxation, or abnormal and undesirable movement of the patella, laterally, relative to its normal up-and-down movement in the vertical track defined by the trochlea, can precipitate the onset of chondromalacia or aggravate existing chondromalacia of the patella, as well as cause diagnostic problems and other painful clinical conditions with respect to the knee. Subluxation of the patella can be caused by certain developmental abnormalities of the skeletal components of the knee and/or the presence of musculoligamentous laxity, trauma or dysplasia. The patella may leave its normal vertical tracking groove as a result of abnormal vector forces and/or by passive lateral or rotary forces. The abrupt abnormal lateral displacement of the patella from its groove during any weight-bearing activity, such as, for example, running, stair climbing, etc., frequently results in an immediate, temporary disability, such as, for example, buckling of the knee, thereby causing a subjective sensation in the knee similar to that caused by other unrelated pathological conditions within the knee. The sensation of pain and/or imminent buckling of the knee results in apprehension and restriction of certain weight-bearing activities, such as, for example, athletic endeavors. The resultant increased abnormal traction forces on the peripatellar soft tissues frequently lead to inflammatory changes and stretching of the retinaculae, patella ligament, patellor tibial and/or tendon (tendinitis-strain). Furthermore, the repetitive, abnormal lateral excursions, which cause abnormal shearing forces, frequently lead to early, accelerated and progressive degenerative changes (chondromalacia) of the patella and femoral condyles. As noted above, problems peculiar to the patella comprise only a portion of all common physiological problems of the knee, and several, unrelated or partially related problems may occur simultaneously, particularly in individuals having loose ligaments, or when engaged in relatively strenuous activities involving the knee. Young children still in the active bone-growth phase of life frequently are relatively loosely ligamented and suffer from various degrees of patella subluxation. It is well recognized that it is preferable to avoid or delay corrective surgery for such individuals, if at all possible, until such individuals reach a more physiologically opportune age, i.e., when their growth plates have closed. A discussion of prior brace patents can be found in my patent application Ser. No. 08/378,606 filed Jan. 26, 1995, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,613,943. From time to time herein where the term &#34;pad&#34; is used, it is intended to encompass any device which applies or transfers external medial forces to the patella or knee cap. It can be of single or multilayered fabric which is freely floating relative to the knee mounting structure such as an enveloping knee sleeve and knee wrap devices. The basic objective is that application of medial force track vertical and horizontal movement of the patella as closely as possible substantially throughout the full range of knee movement. The term &#34;knee enveloping member&#34;includes flexible endless sleeves, flexible straps and equivalent flexible members. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides an improved dynamic patella brace that overcomes deficiencies of known patella bracing systems and is an improvement over my prior invention described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,296,744. In particular, the present invention provides a dynamic patella brace wherein a medial patella force means may more effective track vertical and/or horizontal movement of the patella so as to maintain its most effective operative position with respect to the patella when the knee is flexed. It is an object of the invention to provide an improved dynamic patella brace wherein the medial patella force means or device dynamically floats when the knee is flexed and which more effectively controls the horizontal pressure applied to the patella. Another object of the invention is to provide an improved dynamic patella brace that maintains the medial patella force means in the most effective position with respect to the patella during flexion of the knee. Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved dynamic patella brace having a patella force means adapted to better control of medial and/or horizontal tension. Still another object of the present invention is to provide an improved dynamic patella brace useful for both diagnosis and treatment of patella instabilities. A further object of the present invention is to provide an improved dynamic patella brace for alleviating certain physiological problems of the knee related to, or aggravated by, patella subluxation. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an improved dynamic patella brace capable of performing its bracing or splinting function for the patella during the full, or normal, range of knee flexion and movement. A still further object of the invention is to provide an improved dynamic patella brace to facilitate proper and positive diagnosis of patella subluxation, particularly in its milder form when its clinical presentation simulates that of other pathological conditions of the knee. Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved dynamic patella brace suitable for use in children having patella subluxation, but whose growth plates are still open, so as to delay or avoid the need for corrective surgery until a more physiologically opportune time is reached.",

    "abstract": "The invention pertains to a biopsy device for taking of tissues samples, which consists of a hand piece, in which a hollow biopsy needle is inserted, wherein a portion of the biopsy needle protruding from the hand piece is introduced with its sampling chamber into the tissue being investigated and the tissue is sucked into the sampling chamber by vacuum and then separated by a sample separating mechanism and finally removed. 2. Description of the Related Art A method and a device for cutting out tissue is already known from British Patent Publication No. GB 2018601A, in which the tissue in the biopsy needle is sucked into a cutting region under vacuum influence. In order to create a vacuum in the hollow needle, the hand piece in which the hollow needle is integrated is connected via lines to a vacuum generator situated outside of the hand piece. The cutting off of the sample is done via a cutting mechanism, which is arranged lengthwise-movable in the hollow needle. The sample cut off is kept in the needle. After pulling the needle out from the tissue, the cut-off sample is flushed out from the tip of the needle; therefore, the hand piece is connected via other lines to devices situated outside the hand piece. The vacuum established in the hollow needle is regulated by control elements integrated in the lines. Another biopsy mechanism is known from European Patent Publication No. EP 0890 339 A1, in which the sample is removed under vacuum influence. In the hand piece, in which the biopsy needle with cutting mechanism is integrated and inserted, the biopsy needle is connected via hose connections and lines to an external vacuum generator as well as control devices. The vacuum is brought up from below to the sample removing chamber via a channel molded onto the outer sheath of the biopsy needle. The separating device is arranged lengthwise movable in the hollow space of the biopsy needle. By a rotary movement, combined with a manual lengthwise push, the separating device cuts the sample from the tissue. The sample is transported in the hollow channel of the separating device. A similar arrangement is also shown by U.S. Pat. No. 5,526,822, and here in particular various vacuum feed lines to the sample removal chamber are known, such as the arrangement for cutting mechanisms, in the hollow needle or coaxially as a cutting sheath, on the outside. In both biopsy mechanisms capable of removal of a sample under vacuum, the hand piece of the biopsy device is limited in its freedom of motion by at least one connection hose and/or supply cables to one or more external supply units; furthermore, the mechanisms for creating the vacuum are costly, especially in regard to the regulating mechanisms. The sample is cut out by rotating separation devices which can move lengthwise in the hollow needle chamber. Furthermore, a suction biopsy device is known from German Patent No. DE 40 41 614 C1, which is fashioned as a manual device and which has a partial vacuum source as well as a biopsy cannula connection, which can be placed in rotation by a flexible shaft located outside the hand piece. A biopsy cannula fashioned as a hollow cannula can be mounted on the biopsy cannula connection, preferably having a revolving cutting edge sharpened at the distal end, along whose hollow channel a partial vacuum can be applied, by means of the partial vacuum source, which is configured as a piston and cylinder unit, once the hollow cannula has been positioned at a particular tissue point inside the body. A similar partial vacuum-assisted biopsy device can be found in International Publication No. WO 96/28097, which, though not specifying any hollow cannula placed in rotation, nevertheless has a syringe plunger arrangement located inside a manual device to create partial vacuum. German Patent Publication No. DE 100 34 297 A1 describes, in contrast with the above suction biopsy arrangement with only a single hollow needle, a tissue removal endoscopy instrument, having a biopsy needle arrangement, which specifies a circumferentially sharpened hollow needle at its distal end and a hollow biopsy needle guided inside the hollow needle, wherein the internally guided biopsy needle has a recess for removal of a tissue sample at its distal end. Proximal to the hollow biopsy needle is a suctioning instrument for creating a partial vacuum. A removal of tissue occurs in that the biopsy needle arrangement is pushed in a joint position into a region of tissue being investigated, while the biopsy needle has a distal tip, which protrudes distally from the hollow needle for a length in order to facilitate the process of penetration of the biopsy needle arrangement into the tissue, on the one hand, and to prevent tissue from getting into the interior of the hollow needle, on the other hand. When the biopsy needle arrangement is suitably positioned inside the tissue, the hollow needle is pulled back proximally for a particular length, while the interior biopsy cannula remains in position and the recess is made free. The partial vacuum applied along the biopsy needle produces an active lowering or drawing of surrounding tissue parts into the recess. By controlled distal pushing of the hollow needle with its sharpened distal end beyond the biopsy needle, a portion of the tissue is separated and enclosed inside the recess of the biopsy needle. Then, by joint withdrawal of the biopsy needle arrangement, the separated tissue sample is removed from the body for examination purposes. The entire tissue removal process described above occurs in such a way that the needle movements and the application of partial vacuum are performed manually, individually and separated from each other. With German Patent Publication No. DE 100 34 297 A1, which is considered to be the closest state of the art, the vacuum biopsy device for removal of tissue is based on the problem of configuring the hand piece so that the sample removal sequence can be operated with one hand after being inserted by means of a coaxial cannula, or with no such cannula. On the other hand, the biopsy needle arrangement described in International Publication No. WO 98/25522 enables a spring-operated relative motion between the hollow biopsy needle, located on the interior, and the outer hollow needle surrounding the biopsy needle. In this case as well, the biopsy needle is positioned distally to the sharpened distal tip of the hollow needle in order to take a sample, there being provided a partial vacuum source for supplying a partial vacuum through the hollow biopsy needle into the area of its recess, assisting the process of bringing in the tissue. The process of positioning the biopsy needle relatively and finally inside the region of tissue being investigated is done exclusively manually. Such a positioning leads only to unsatisfactory biopsy results, especially when investigating hard tissue regions. Likewise, a vacuum-assisted biopsy device is described in US Patent Publication No. 2001/0011156 A1, which calls for a compactly configured hand device, in whose housing all drive elements necessary for propelling the needle of the biopsy needle arrangement are provided. However, a partial vacuum source is provided separate from the hand device, which can be connected via an appropriate supply line to the needle arrangement inside the hand device at a suitable connection location. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to one aspect of the invention, a tension slide that is brought into cocked position by electric motor power against the action of a spring, the needle unit being arranged on the tension slide mounted in the hand piece, wherein the sample removal chamber is shot into the tissue after releasing the cocked tension slide. The vacuum pressure-generating device, as well as other control and supply devices, are integrated in the housing of the hand piece, and the connection element, from the biopsy needle to the vacuum pressure-generating unit, is arranged directly on the housing. The vacuum pressure-generating device comprises a controllable piston/cylinder unit, having a ventilation opening, so that excess pressure can be generated in the vacuum pressure-generating device for ejection of the sample. All drive units are electrically operated, and the drive unit for the tension slide may also be used as the drive unit for the cutting sheath. The hollow biopsy needle is surrounded by an exterior coaxial cutting sheath, and at the front side of the housing there is arranged a board for actuating the electronics, in which the tension slide release is integrated. According to another aspect of the invention, by arranging all necessary devices in the hand piece, the hand piece is freely movable; furthermore, high-speed electrical drive units are used exclusively, and the tension slide and the sample separating device are operated by the same drive unit. This produces a compact device, independent of other supply units. The drive units can be accommodated in a relatively small housing. Even the electronics and the operating and measuring instruments are arranged on the housing, or accommodated in it. This also applies to the power supply and the connection elements. It is therefore possible to bring together partial processes into a single control step and simplify the attendance, so that the attendance can be done with only one hand. According to another aspect of the invention, for an especially simple and reliable configuration of the vacuum generating device, the use of a piston/cylinder unit with ventilation possibility to create the vacuum and the excess pressure works well. Especially advantageous is the use of a familiar syringe/plunger unit, with a ventilation opening arranged in addition in the upper part of the syringe body, which is opened in order to dissipate the vacuum by further retraction of the syringe plunger. By controlling the spindle drive unit of the plunger spindle, the same plunger/syringe unit can be switched as needed from generating a vacuum to generating an excess pressure, using, to dissipate the vacuum, a ventilation opening arranged in the upper part, through which air flows in, and is compressed in the following step. According to another aspect of the invention, in order to control the motion of the plunger, especially in regard to switching from creation of a vacuum to dissipation of a vacuum and generating of excess pressure, a spindle drive with electric DC motor with secondary reduction gearing has proven to be advantageous as the drive unit. The measured speed of revolution of the motor represents a direct measure of the lengthwise displacement of the plunger. Since this is a high-speed DC motor, whose take-off speed is considerably reduced by a reduction gearing, the lengthwise motion of the spindle can be controlled exactly. The length of the spindle travel and thus the magnitude of the vacuum and the excess pressure can be set with appropriate setpoint values in the control electronics, e.g., the speed of revolution of the motor. According to another aspect of the invention, since a sterile biopsy needle is used for each patient, it has proven to be advantageous to separate the sterile parts from other merely disinfected parts that are firmly connected to the hand piece. For this reason, it is convenient to design the vacuum pressure-generating device, the biopsy needle with cutting sheath and the parts connected to the biopsy needle and cutting sheath, such as the biopsy needle carrier, the drive elements and plastic piece including connection element and guide roller as an independent, easily inserted and removed sterile insert element. The space for the insert element is separated from the other drive elements by covers, for reasons of cleaning of the hand piece. According to another aspect of the invention, for sake of simplicity, the flexible connection element is fashioned as a flexible hose, so that it can adapt to the displacement travel of the tension slide. In order to allow for twisting of the hose relative to the biopsy needle at the proximal end, an additional rotary mounted plastic piece is arranged in the plastic piece firmly connected to the biopsy needle, to which the hose is attached. In order to enable a lengthwise movement of the gear connected to the spindle casing for driving of the spindle casing, e.g., when the tension slide is released, a toothed roller is provided as the drive unit. In order to provide for a cocking of the tension slide via the biopsy needle carrier by turning the cutting sheath, the gear at the end face of the threaded spindle casing is supported against a holder of the base block during the cocking process, so that the biopsy needle carrier moves to the right, while the cutting sheath maintains its position. According to another aspect of the invention, the locking of the tension slide has a double-arm lever, whose one arm engages under spring pressure with the recess of the tension slide. In order to allow for use of the tension device for different biopsy needles with different insertion depths, e.g., 15 to 25 mm, it is only necessary to adapt the length of the engaging lever and use appropriate settings in the electronics, for example. The plastic piece joined to the biopsy needle enables a turning of the sample removal chamber by means of a knurled disk. The biopsy needle can be locked in the desired position by the interaction of the polygon of the plastic piece and the biopsy needle carrier. A notch made in the knurled disk shows the user the radial position for the opening of the sample removal chamber. According to another aspect of the invention, the cross section of the hollow biopsy needle is limited by a narrowing, a stuffing, or a lip at the sample removal chamber. This narrowing is around 60-75% of the height and closes off the upper open part of the sample removal chamber from above. This narrowing in front of the sample removal chamber has the effect that the vacuum sucks in the tissue being investigated from the bottom—upon opening of the sample removal chamber—(i.e., upon retraction of the cutting sheath). The narrowing in addition prevents tissue from getting into the rear part of the hollow needle space. When the sample is ejected, the narrowing produces a pressure increase in the sample removal chamber, which improves the cleaning effect, especially in the sample removal chamber. By applying the vacuum, the tissue of the sample is sucked into the interior of the sample removal chamber and clings more or less to the inner wall. For better adhesion, additional means can be provided in the interior of the sample removal chamber. Since the cutting sheath is arranged on the outer diameter of the biopsy needle and thus the separation of the tissue occurs externally, the tissue clinging to the inner space is not detached from the inner wall by the cutting mechanism, thanks to the external arrangement of the cutting sheath. Furthermore, the tissue cannot get into the cavity of the rotating cutting mechanism and get stuck inside. Guiding of the cutting sheath with its round cross section on the outer side of the biopsy needle with its round cross section has the advantage that no twisting (turning) of the sample can occur by the cutting rotation of the cutting mechanism, thus fulfilling a major requirement for the evaluation of the tissue by the pathologist. In order to achieve a good adhesion of the sample in the inner space without impairing the fill ratio, the sample removal chamber is configured so that approximately 25% of its cross section is open for suctioning in the sample, i.e., the larger portion of the circumference is closed. According to another aspect of the invention, the arrangement of the coaxial cutting sheath on the outside also has the effect that a larger sample can be removed than when the cutting sheath is arranged on the inside. Since the sample is ejected with assistance from a pressure built up from the sample removal chamber, no damage to the tissue occurs when taking the tissue out. Thanks to the central arrangement of the base block at the center of the inner chamber of the housing, the housing itself is protected against transverse forces produced by the drive elements. Furthermore, it is easy to replace the drive units, as well as the tension slide, since it is only necessary to loosen the connections to the housing for this. It is also advantageous that the impacts produced by the plastic tension slide are absorbed by the base block. According to another aspect of the invention, the storing of the biopsy needle/cutting sheath in a biopsy needle carrier made of plastic has the advantage, among others, that the molded-on sliding surfaces enable a trouble-free sliding on the opposing surfaces of the base block and the molded-on block. The biopsy needle carrier transmits the forces from the spindle drive of the cutting sheath to the tension slide. Since the spindle drive thrusts against the holder of the base block when the tension slide changes position and it can slide freely when the tension sheath is rotated (the gear can slide axially in the toothed roller), the drive unit can be used for both motion sequences (tensioning of the tension slide, opening and closing of the sample removal chamber by means of the cutting sheath). The miniature switch integrated in the housing end piece, which turns the power supply off and on by the closing of the housing cover with the vacuum pressure-generating device inserted, as well as the retaining tabs arranged on the biopsy needle carrier, are safety mechanisms which prevent a tensioning of the tension slide when the housing cover is open. Furthermore, an opening of the housing cover when the needle is under tension will be precluded.",

    "abstract": "The current invention relates to a mechanism that enables wheels attached to luggage or other such items to be retracted, thus saving space when not in use. The invention allows wheels to be attached to an item and used as normal, often in conjunction with a handle, for making the movement of bulky items easier. The invention then enables the user to easily retract the wheels so they no longer protrude from the item, allowing it to be easily and compactly stored. 2. Description of the Related Art Over recent years with the increase in awareness of risks associated with lifting and carrying heavy or bulky items, more suitcases and other such items are manufactured with integrated wheels. Although not always, these wheels usually protrude from a bottom edge of the item with a handle provided on a top edge to rock the item onto the wheels and pull it along. As such, the wheels often end up wasting a disproportionate amount of space compared to their size when the item is in need of being stored either in a confined space (such as an overhead locker on an aeroplane) or when a large number are being stored together (for example supply transportation). This makes the prospect of being able to retract the wheels into the item to reduce the amount of space wasted very attractive to producers and designers, as they would then be able to utilise more of the space taken up by the item. Further, significant time, effort and therefore expense is put in to the aesthetics of travel luggage. There is little scope for modifying the appearance of wheels attached to these items of luggage, and as such, the aesthetics of most travel luggage items is affected by the addition of clunky, bland and often dirty wheels. It would thus be desirable for the wheels to be concealed when not in use, thus improving the appearance of the luggage, and giving designers more freedom during the design stage. The problem is that as of yet there has not been a satisfactory design to achieve this goal. Many devices enable the retraction of wheels using a variety of mechanisms. These mechanisms are often located adjacent to the wheel, and hence close to the ground. This leads to problems with the ingress of dirt and water from the floor into the mechanism which can cause wear, increased stiction and ultimately premature failure. Such mechanisms also therefore often require the user to directly interact with the wheels. This is both awkward and time consuming as users are forced to upend their luggage or other item and manually retract the wheels. In certain situations this is undesirable as the user may be in a rush, may be in a confined space, for example on an aeroplane, the bottom of the item may be dirty or wet or it may simply be too heavy to lift and manoeuvre Another factor and important limitation on the durability and robustness of current solutions is the complexity of the design; quite often such devices comprise a number of moving parts, hinges and other dynamic components such as in U.S. Pat. No. 4,575,109, the whole contents of which are incorporated by reference. Generally, the higher the number of components and connections the less robust and durable the design. Further, current retraction mechanism designs often take up a large amount of space, this then either protrudes from the luggage or item, making it quite unwieldy, or is located inside the luggage or item, thus detracting from the space for the luggage or item itself. This negates the benefit of having a method to retract the wheels to save space. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention seeks to improve upon such existing designs by providing a mechanism for enabling wheels to be retracted, whereby: the size of the mechanism is kept to a minimum, and is in fact in certain embodiments contained within conventional components; the design is kept simple and robust; and the location and nature of the invention is such that it makes operating the invention easy—being operable without having to interact with the wheels directly—and in fact being automatic upon retraction of the handle of the item. While many current products allow users to roll their luggage on integrated wheels, and some current designs even allow the user to retract these wheels upon arrival, none provide as easy, efficient or convenient a solution as the present invention. With the present invention the wheels of the luggage or item can be retracted automatically upon returning the extendible handle to its housing. As such the user is not required to spend any additional time retracting the wheels, and also does not need to bend down or lift the luggage or item to be able to retract the wheels. Additionally the retraction mechanism can be extremely robust, and so need not limit the usable life of the luggage or item. The present invention also allows the wheels to be concealed when not in use, greatly improving the aesthetics of the bag when not being pulled on the wheels. There is a large scope of different methods of concealing the wheels, and this provides a large amount of flexibility for the designers. Further advantages of the present invention will become apparent as further features of the present invention are described. Throughout this application reference is made to “travel luggage”. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, in the context of this application travel luggage is thought to incorporate any luggage with at least one of the following features: it can be completely closed;   it can lie flat on one of its larger faces; and   it has an opening that extends for substantially the whole extent of the luggage along its largest axis.",

    "abstract": "A combined vacuum cleaner storage housing and vacuum cleaner for use by barbers, hair stylists and pet groomers to dispose of cut hair. The floor upon which the housing is placed, serves as the bottom wall of the throat which receives the hair and which communicates with the nozzle of a Shop-Vac® or equal vacuum cleaner disposed within the housing. The apparatus features a plant storage and display area at the top. The unit has four vertical walls, one of which preferably the rear has an access door therein. The unit sits on a base which has a front opening which communicates with the throat aforementioned. Operation of the vacuum is by a foot switch which for aesthetics emanates from the rear of the apparatus. DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT FIG. 1 depicts the first embodiment 10 of the vacuum cleaner storage housing and vacuum cleaner of this invention disposed upon the floor 70 of a typical hair cutting salon, adjacent a customer&#39;s chair 71 and in plain view. Disposed within the top of the apparatus 10 are a plurality of wood chips 72 disposed within a storage area, 22 per FIG. 4, from which extends a pair of preferably silk palm trees. In this view are seen the front wall 12 and the right side wall 15 of the main body 11. Left side wall 13 called out in FIG. 2 is a mirror image of wall 15. Main body 11 sits on a base 25 also visible in FIG. 1. In FIG. 2, which is a front view of the apparatus, there is shown the main body 11&#39;s front wall 12, the spaced side walls 13 and 15 normally disposed thereto and the base 25. Optionally, but preferably the front wall 12, and/or the two side walls 13, 15 may employ a two part construction comprising a subwall 20, usually of wood or perhaps metal or plastic with an overlay 19 of preferably a glass mirror or other laminated material such as Formica® or similar high pressure laminate sheet goods, or even a wood veneer. Since the rear wall usually rests near or against a room wall, it need not have the outer layer or skin of the plastic, mirror or veneer. Base 25, which is formed of two pairs of spaced members nailed or otherwise joined together at their corners to form a rectangle, is sized to match the cross section of the main body 11, and has a front opening 36. Seen in dashed line is top shelf 18, which is normal to and spaced down from the upper edge of each of the front, side and rear walls. The trim molding 17 is disposed on these upper edges and thus helps to define the storage area 22, seen in FIG. 4. See infra. The rear view FIG. 3 is the next view to be discussed. Here, rear wall 16, is seen to have a cutout or opening 26 for access to the vacuum cleaner 27 which rests upon the bottom shelf 21 seen in dashed line in FIG. 2. Opening 26 includes a recessed door jamb 24, which serves as a stop for removable door 23 seen in FIG. 8 by being recessed in from the exterior face of the wall a distance equal to the thickness of the door to be placed up against it. This is a conventional door opening carpentry technique. Vacuum cleaner 27 may be a Shop-Vac® or an equally heavy duty canister-type vacuum. Vacuum 27 is a conventional unit and which comprises a motorized operational head 28 which is removably attached to a dirt receiving canister 29. A flexible hose 30 frictionally engaged to, and in fluid communication with head 28 on one end extends downwardly within main body 11 to the bottom shelf 21. Shelf 21 has an opening 34, or if desired a mere cutout, through which extends the intake opening 31. Flexible hose 30 on its distant end is frictionally engaged to and in fluid communication with intake opening 31. Such unions are conventional. See also FIG. 6. The reader is now referred to the top perspective view FIG. 4 wherein the storage area 22 is seen. Its use is for one or more preferably silk plants, as shown. Storage area 22 is defined by the upper surface of the plant (top) shelf 18 and a pair of spaced divider members 14 which while shown running horizontally could run from front to back if desired and which are disposed at or near the leading and trailing edges of the shelf 18. As shown, the divider members 14 are stapled or otherwise secured to the shelf 18 and to the two side walls 13, 15. Each divider member is seen to be spaced a few inches from its respective front or rear wall to thereby provide a downward extending slot 33 which communicates with interior 46 for airflow. Thus heat, which occurs from the vacuum head during periods of operation, can rise and escape to the atmosphere through the aforementioned slots. While a moisture nonpermeable top shelf 18 and divider members 14 are contemplated, for the sake of safety it is urged that only silk or plastic plants be disposed within the storage area 22 to avoid the necessity of adding water which could if Murphy&#39;s law is followed, drip down onto the vacuum cleaner and cause damage. We now turn to FIG. 5, which is a sectional view taken along the line III--III of FIG. 3 just below the top shelf 18. Thus vacuum 27 is seen to be disposed upon bottom shelf 21 within interior 46. Each of the front two corners may include an optional stiffener 32 in the form of a 1×2 beam member running vertically with the subwall material 20 disposed therebetween. However from the point of view of construction, it may be easier to utilize the stiffeners only between the floor and the bottom shelf 21 ie. within the base 25.. These stiffeners would help define the opening 36 which communicates with the throat 45 leading to nozzle 31 per FIG. 6. In FIG. 6, which is a bottom plan view, the area beneath the second shelf 21, is seen. Here, a cross brace 42 is disposed between the two sides, 25A and 25B of the base, slightly distant from the midpoint along the depth of the sides. Cross brace 42 may also be connected to the underside of bottom shelf 21. Cross brace 42 includes a central opening 43 into which is fitted the distal end of intake opening 31, its proximal end being engaged as previously note the flexible tubing 30. See FIG. 3. A pair of diverging, throat-defining members 44, are each connected on one end to opposite sides of opening 43, and on their other ends to the optional stiffeners 32 if employed, or to the front 25C of said base. Thus a path that leads directly to intake opening 31 is seen to have been created, with the floor acting as the bottom surface, and the bottom shelf 21 serving as the upper part of this enclosure. Wavy arrow 47 symbolizes the hair that would enter through opening 36 into the throat 45 and onward to the intake opening 31 on its way to the canister 29. Operation of the vacuum 27 is controlled by a conventional toe pedal actuator 39 connected electrically in line with an optional thermal sensor 40, which is also electrically connected to the line cord 41. One of each of the two ends of the line cord and the toe pedal actuator line 41 to the vacuum 27 are conventionally attached, but in the current figure they are shown unconnected for ease of depiction. A standard plug 38 is shown at the external end of the line cord 41. See also FIG. 5. Rear wall 16 is seen to include at least one opening 37 though which pass the wires for 39 and 41. Such openings are normally in the base 25 of the apparatus. FIG. 8 again depicts the rear wall 16 shown with its top molding trim 17. Here, however, door 23 is shown installed in place up against door jamb 24. Door 23 is retained in place by rotatable retainer tabs 50, which are each held against wall 16 by a single screw 51. It is readily seen that rear wall 16 need not require the placement of an overlay such as a mirror or high pressure laminate since it normally rests against a wall and is seen only during such time as it is necessary to empty vacuum 47, at which time the unit 10, is moved away from the wall. A handle or knob 52 is shown centrally positioned on door 23. It is within the skill of the art to replace upper retainers 50 with conventional hinges if desired. FIG. 9 serves to merely recap the preferred mode of construction that has been previously discussed. Thus a typical wall is seen to comprise a skin such as a mirror 19 adhesed to a wood or other material subwall 20. To prevent someone from being cut by the mirror edge and to hide the end grain, as well as to enhance the aesthetics, a cap molding 17 may be overlaid on the combined edges of 19 and 20. Molding 17 may be frictionally fit or adhesed into place. Solid wall construction without the use of a skin for the two side and front walls is also contemplated. FIG. 10 depicts a second embodiment 100, of this invention. Here the front wall 111 has the access door 112. Door 112 is retained in place by side mounted hinges 122, and is opened by knob 152. Base 25 and the elements found between the bottom shelf 21, shown in dashed line, and the floor are the same as in the first embodiment. Storage area 22 is also the same as in the first embodiment. Rear wall 116 need not have an access door in view of the accessibility to the vacuum through front door 112. From a sizing point of view, I have found that a unit having a width of about 14 inches, a depth of about the same amount and an overall height of about 2 feet 8 inches is aesthetically pleasing. A unit sized as such will fit easily through doors and will accommodate the preferred model vacuum cleaner recited above. Obviously, if a smaller capacity vacuum is used a generally smaller unit could be built. Larger units are also contemplated. While the embodiments described above both include a separate base section, it is recognized of course that the base can be integral with and a part of the side, front and rear walls. The use of a separate base is seen to be preferred, since the preferred skin over the wood subwall is glass mirrors. By not having the glass touch the floor, breakage due to impact with brushes, toes, or other implements can be avoided. While not required, it is preferred to line the interior 46 of the unit (FIG. 2) with a sound deadening material 49, as by stapling it to the interior of the housing&#39;s walls 13, 15, and 11 and perhaps the rear wall as well. Such material is called out in the right cutaway of FIG. 2.",
    "full_text": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n     An age old problem of barber shops, hair stylists and pet grooming facilities is what to do with the unsightly hair that accumulates from the cutting operation. Usually it is gathered with a push broom and swept into one corner of the salon. It is then brushed into a dustpan for disposal in the trash. This is a chore that no employee cherishes, since oftentimes loose hair can collect on one&#39;s clothes during the disposal operation. \n     As an alternative, one can utilize a vacuum cleaner to collect the hair, but these instruments are not intended for operation on linoleum floors, which are favored by salons of the type described. Therefore the use of the push broom is favored. Sometimes, the vacuum cleaner is used instead of the dustpan to lift the hair from the floor. This would avoid the bending over chore. But one must still retrieve the vacuum from the storage area of the salon, as these instruments do not add to the decor of the salon if left ...",

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In its simplest terms, a golf club consists of an elongate shaft carrying, at the lower end, a head having a striking surface and, at the upper end, a grip. The terminal portion of the upper end of the shaft is termed the butt end and the terminal portion of the lower end is termed the tip end. Conventional golf clubs generally have tapered shafts made of steel, metal alloys, or composite materials. Such shafts have traditionally had a tapered shape whose cross section changes continuously and smoothly, and whose maximum diameter is measured at the butt end and minimum diameter is measured at the tip end. More recently, golf club shafts have been created which depart from the straight taper convention and provide parallel regions, constricted regions and expanded regions located in diverse areas in the shaft. The stated purpose for such variations are to control the mechanical properties of the club, i.e., the elastic line under torsion and/or flexion of the shaft, while providing desirable ergonometric qualities in the grip area of the club. Traditionally, conventional clubs have a slip-on grip of compliant material, in order to provide a conventional grip dimension so that the club will fit a broad range of users. DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides for improved golf club shafts and golf club incorporating such shafts of extremely light weight and thereby providing golf clubs with a balance point located in the region where the club head is joined to the shaft.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to intracellular calcium overload, also known as calcium leak, which plays a role in the transition from reversible to irreversible injury during ischemia/reperfusion in cells. More particularly, the present invention relates to methods for reducing the uptake of calcium during such overload or leak conditions to reduce or prevent cell death. 2. Description of Related Art The publications and other reference materials referred to herein to describe the background of the invention and to provide additional detail regarding its practice are hereby incorporated by reference. For convenience, the reference materials are numerically referenced and grouped in the appended bibliography. It is well-known that excessive calcium influx represents the final common pathway in cell death(1). An increase in intracellular calcium has been demonstrated in response to a variety of noxious stimuli including ischemia(2), hypoxia-reoxygenation(3), metabolic inhibition(4) and reperfusion(2,5). Elevated levels of intracellular calcium are thought to be of importance in the transition from reversible to irreversible injury in cardiac(5) and other cell types(6). Although the pathogenesis of the calcium leak has been the subject of considerable research, the exact mechanism remains to be established. One proposed mechanism is the Na-Ca exchanger operating in reversed mode secondary to a rise of intracellular sodium which has been documented early in ischemia(7,8). Further support for this proposed mechanism has been provided by the demonstration that the oxygen radical scavenger 1,3-dimethyl-2-thiourea(DMTU) protects rat ventricular myocytes against hypoxia(9). DMTU was shown to be an inhibitor of Na-Ca exchange. Accordingly, it was concluded that Ca influx in hypoxia occurs via Na-Ca exchange. Other calcium leak mechanisms have been proposed in addition to the above suggested reversal of Na-Ca exchanger activity. These other mechanisms include: calcium leak through defects in the sarcolemma(SL); calcium leak via the voltage-activated calcium channels; or calcium leak through specific calcium leak channels which have been recently identified in cardiac and other cells(10,11,12). There presently is a need to provide further elucidation of the mechanisms by which calcium leak occurs and the role played by elevated calcium levels in cell death. Equally important is the need to provide methods which are capable of controlling calcium leak in order to prevent, or at least reduce, the leakage of calcium into cells during exposure to noxious stimuli. Such methods will be useful in avoiding cell damage or death. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, a method is provided for reducing the uptake or influx of calcium into a mammalian cell by treating the cell surface with a cationic agent. It was discovered that alteration of the cell surface charge by treatment with a cationic agent provides an effective procedure for eliminating, or at least reducing, the amount of calcium transported into the cell during exposure to a noxious stimuli. The method may be used to treat cells either in vivo or in vitro. The method requires the exposure of the cell surface to an amount of a cationic agent which alters the cell surface charge a sufficient amount to reduce calcium uptake without disrupting the cell. The method is well-suited for treating muscle cells, such as cardiac myocytes. The method is applicable to cells having a sarcolemma or to cells in general which have calcium leak channels. As a feature of the present invention, it was discovered that the level of charge on the cationic agent is directly related to the ability of the agent to prevent calcium uptake. Accordingly, strong organic poly-cationic agents, such as protamine and polymyxin B sulfate (PXB) are especially effective in limiting calcium influx. The method of the present invention is effective in reducing calcium uptake by cells in a variety of noxious situations. These situations include metabolic inhibition and free radical attack. This versatility makes the method useful as part of a general therapeutic approach to prevent or substantially reduce cell death resulting from calcium influx.",

The method comprises the steps of, after fan beam helical imaging data has been acquired, processing the data to generate parallel constant-Z projections proximate the imaging plane, filtering the parallel constant-Z projections and mathematically combining the parallel constant-Z projections as a function of the spatial relationship between the imaging plane and the constant-Z projections to generate at least one image. Preferably the processing step includes rebinning the fan beam data into parallel multi-Z projections which include parallel rays at different locations and mathematically combining the parallel multi-Z projections to generate the parallel constant-Z projections. In one embodiment the step of mathematically combining the multi-Z projections includes the step of interpolating between adjacent projections. In another embodiment the step of mathematically combining multi-Z projections includes the step of extrapolating among projections. In one aspect the step of mathematically combining as a function of the spatial relationships includes the step of mathematically combining as a function of the distances in Z between the imaging plane and the constant-Z projections. The method is also for generating a second image within a second imaging plane from the helical data and, to this end, comprises the steps of, after filtering, mathematically combining the parallel constant-Z projections as a function of the distance in Z between the second imaging plane and the constant-Z projections to generate the second image. In another aspect the step of mathematically combining the parallel constant-Z projections includes weighting a sub-set of the constant-Z projections, combining the subset of weighted projections to generate a set of image projections and back-projecting the image projections to generate the image. Preferably the step of weighting a sub-set includes selecting constant-Z projection pairs, each pair including a first constant-Z projection on a first side of and adjacent the imaging plane and a second constant-Z projection on a second side of and adjacent the imaging plane and weighting each projection pair ray as a function of the distance in Z between the projection including the ray and the image plane and wherein the step of combining the subsets includes, after the projection rays have been weighted, combining the rays in each projection pair into a single projection to be back-projected.

    "abstract": "Implants in the form of vascular prostheses are employed as substitute for a natural diseased vessel. The diseased section of vessel is removed and replaced by an implant. Thus, for example, small-lumen implants are employed in vascular surgery especially when the endogenous vessels of a patient cannot be used. This is the case for example when a specific length of vessel is required, or if the autologous vessels cannot be employed because of pathophysiological properties. Vascular prostheses made of synthetic material are employed here, use being made in particular of synthetic materials such as, for example, knitted or woven threads of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or vascular prostheses made of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE). Vascular implants made of these synthetic materials are preferably used because they have advantageous structural and biocompatible properties. Thus, on the one hand, surrounding tissue is able to grow in and, on the other hand, blood plasma must not escape through the pores. This is achieved through the pore size adjusted with the ePET implants, whereas knitted and woven PET implants are impregnated by coating with absorbable materials such as, for example, collagen or gelatin. Following implantation, the coating is absorbed at the rate at which the surrounding newly formed tissue grows into the porous collagen layer. It is known that the use of the implants described above in the small-lumen vessel range leads to high rates of occlusion. This is because in particular contact of slow-flowing blood with synthetic surfaces may lead to activation of the coagulation system, the complement system and the immune system. Further approaches to avoiding blood coagulation are in the direction of colonizing the coated implants with cells such as, for example, endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. Interaction of the various cell types which are present for example in natural vessels, and the cell-matrix interaction are important for the functionality of the implants. Thus, besides high biocompatibility, it is also necessary to ensure that the structure of the implant is suited to the requirements of various cells. Implants are subject to special mechanical and structural requirements. Thus, besides a sufficient structural stability, they should also have a force and stretching behaviour adapted to the tissue to be replaced. Implants must additionally have various fitting shapes, lengths and diameters. In addition, the microstructuring such as, for example, in the bioartificial vessel substitute the pore structure extending radially with cell-specific size plays an important role for the colonization with cells and for the growing tissue.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates generally to primate education devices, and more particularly relates to a primate education device having a variable and programmable maze structure. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Primate instructional devices are known in the art. These devices typically serve the dual purposes of both educating the primate and enriching the primate&#39;s environment. There is increasing awareness that captive primates in civilized environments require mental stimulation to maintain health, strength and well-being. In fact, government regulation now mandates such humane treatment of caged primates. Several such devices are designed for a primate to guide an object through a maze, i.e. by simulating &#34;foraging&#34; for a morsel of food so that the primate may retrieve the food at the end of a maze. Normally, however, a primate can learn a maze structure fairly rapidly, and the simpler, fixed maze-type educational devices are thus quickly stripped of their utility. Another drawback of many of these devices is that with more difficult mazes, which a primate may not learn absent some degree of instruction, there is no way to actually &#34;teach&#34; the primate to maneuver an object through the maze. Thus, there is a need in the art for a primate educational device which is provided with (1) a variable rather than a fixed maze structure, and (2) a means for instructing the primate through the maze. The primate educational device of the present invention is directed to each of these considerations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an educational device for enriching the environment of a contained primate, which device includes a variable and programmable maze structure. It is another object of the present invention to provide a primate educational device having a means for instructing a primate through the maze. It is still another object of the present invention to provide such a device having varying and programmable degrees of difficulty. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a primate educational device attachable to a fixture in a primate environment such as to the exterior or to the interior of a primate cage, the maze structure of the device being accessible from both inside and outside the cage. It is still a further object of the present invention to provide a primate educational device having a plurality of movable connecting stops within a container means, the connecting stops providing a continuous and variable pathway within the device. Additional objects, advantages and novel features of the invention will be set forth in part in the description which follows, and in part will become apparent to those skilled in the art on examination of the following, or may be learned by practice of the invention. In one aspect of the present invention, a primate education device is provided which can be placed in a primate environment, alleviating boredom and encouraging interaction with and active participation in the primate&#39;s environment. The device is specifically directed toward enriching the environment of individually housed research primates, including a variety of apes and monkeys. In a preferred embodiment, the device comprises a container means attachable to a fixture of a primate environment, for example, to the grating of a primate cage, the container means including a variable, programmable maze structure accessible from both inside and outside the cage. In a preferred embodiment, the container means is provided with opposing panels having substantially oppositely disposed access ports, and further is provided with a plurality of movable connecting stops defining a variable and continuous pathway within the container means.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a universal catheter inserted by conventional means which, once in place, functions as an external ureteral catheter which can be easily converted into an internalized ureteral catheter or stent. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Ureteral catheters and stents are fundamental to the practice of Urology. These devices allow one to bypass and drain an obstructed ureter, determine urine output from a particular renal unit, and inject contrast to study the upper urinary tract. With the advent of newer methods to manage upper urinary tract stones (ESWL and ureteroscopy), the indications and use of ureteral catheters have and will continue to further increase. The ideal ureteral catheter should allow one to measure urine output from a particular renal unit, drain even tenaciously purulent material, allow injection of contrast for imaging and finally remain indwelling and self contained if longterm ureteral stenting or drainage is required. The presently available devices consist of external or internal ureteral catheters. Both types are usually passed through the ureteral meatus via a cystoscope, though they can be placed openly through different sites in the urinary tract. Externalized ureteral catheters drain the upper urinary tract and pass through the bladder, exiting the urethra and draining into an external collecting device. They allow drainage through ports and a central lumen and can be irrigated as needed to drain tenacious and obstructing material. By draining externally, the output from the involved renal unit can be carefully monitored. Contrast can be injected as needed to evaluate the upper tract. Unfortunately, these devices are not self contained and must be secured to an indwelling urethral catheter or they will migrate and be extruded by ureteral peristalsis. They therefore are not suitable for longterm outpatient care. With this objective in mind, internalized ureteral catheters were developed. The most commonly used type is a plastic catheter with a curl at both the proximal and distal ends; i.e. Double J catheter. The curls are straightened over a central stiffening wire in order to pass the stent, but are reformed when the stiffening wire is removed. The proximal curl prevents distal migration and thereby keeps the device in the renal pelvis. The distal curl is positioned in the bladder to allow completely internalized drainage. No urethral catheter is needed to secure this type of stent, making it ideal for outpatient management. U.S. Pat. No. 4,713,049 to Carter; 4,307,723 to Finney and 4,610,657 to Densaw all show this general approach while U.S. Pat 4,531,933 shows a variation of this concept by using helixes to replace hooks. The devices shown by these patents, however, have disadvantages. The urine output from the involved renal unit can not be recorded as only total urethral urine output can be recorded and this would include both kidneys. Also, since the distal end of the catheter is internalized, it is not possible to irrigate the tube should it become obstructed. Under these circumstances the obstructed catheter could be more detrimental than beneficial as it would occlude an already narrowed ureteral lumen. Since the ureteral catheter can become obstructed without any external indication, the situation can become dramatically acute before it is realized that the internalized stent is no longer serving its purpose. Lastly, as the stent is not externalized, contrast cannot be injected if needed to image the upper tract. A modification of the usual Double J catheter is available at present that allows injection of contrast via a small lumen--in the stiffening wire. This lumen however, is too small to allow reliable and accurate monitoring of urine output or drainage and irrigation of tenacious debris from the involved kidney. SUMMARY AND OBJECT OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a combination catheter-stent that improves on the known prior art devices in that it has the advantages of both an externalized ureteral catheter and the advantage of an internalizable ureteral catheter once the necessity of externalized drainage or access is overcome. The device of the present invention comprises a Double J catheter with side ports along its proximal half. The proximal end is preferably closed. The distal one-third of the Double J catheter has a wider lumen diameter and is open ended and has consequently a somewhat wider outer diameter than the proximal end. This allows the distal end of the ureteral stent to accept the insertion of a rigid open-ended ureteral catheter. The distal end of the Double-J catheter terminates in a flange of greater outer diameter in order to allow retraction of the stiff ureteral catheter from the stent against an immobilizing abutting device. This rigid ureteral catheter is long enough to exit the urethra and can be drained by an external drainage system. When the necessity of outside drainage, contrast injection, or monitoring no longer exists, the rigid catheter can be easily disconnected from the flexible ureteral catheter. This allows the part of the stent in the bladder to return to its preformed curl or J shape and then function as a prior art stent of the Double J shape.",

    "abstract": "The present invention is in the field of protection of the eyes of individuals exposed to particulate debris which may impact and harm their eyes. Professionals that would benefit from using the breathing mask with debris deflector of the present invention include dentists, dental assistants, dental hygienists and other practitioners exposed to air-borne fine-size particulate debris. The mask of the present invention features deflectors positioned to close the gap/opening/unobstructed space between the bottom profile of a protective eyewear (glasses) worn by the wearer of the mask of the present invention and the upper portions (left and right) of the mask and thus deflect air-borne fine-size particles away from the eyes of the mask wearer. Unlike the shields of the prior art, the debris deflector of the present invention does not interfere with the field of vision of the wearer and thus does not cause any glare or visual distortion. BACK GROUND OF THE INVENTION Full-face protective shields of the prior art are designed to protect the entire face of the wearer, i.e., from the bottom of the chin to the top of the forehead. Half-face protective shields of the prior art are designed to protect the eyes and forehead of the wearer. Examples of such half-face protective shields are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,020,533, 5,694,925, 5,704,349 and 5,765,556. Each of these patents is hereby incorporated in this disclosure, in its entirety, by reference. A significant drawback of the half-face protective shields of the prior art is that they are bulky, cumbersome and inconvenient to wear. This is particularly true when the transparent shield is not optically correct and causes visual distortion. These half-face shields also interfere with the use of loops worm by dentists in order to provide them with the necessary magnification of the teeth and gum being examined or worked on. On the other hand, breathing masks of the prior art featuring transparent optically-correct half-face protective shields provide effective protection of the wearer against debris and splashing fluids. These masks, though presently used by dentists, dental assistants and dental hygienists, do not allow such practitioners to get close to the work area, i.e., to the teeth and gum being examined or worked on. To overcome this limitation, some dentists utilize breathing masks with no protective shields in combination with protective eyewear (glasses), or their prescription glasses. A problem that is encountered with this arrangement is that a gap is unavoidably left open between the bottom profile of the protective eyewear (glasses) worn by the practitioner and the upper portions (left and right) of the mask through which debris can penetrate, impact and harm the dental professional&#39;s eye. The present invention addresses the need to close the above described gap without interfering with the field of vision of the wearer. It also allows the wearer to use loops while not interfering with the wearer&#39;s field of vision nor causing any visual distortion.",

    "abstract": "Various techniques are known for the deposition of HA onto surfaces for use as biological implants. Thomas et al. (12th Annual Meetinq of the Society for Biomaterials. pp. 15, 1986) disclosed that plasma-sprayed HA-coated porous titanium hip implants, that are inserted into adult mongrel dogs, demonstrate increased amounts of bone in growth as compared to non-HA coated implants. The coating was sintered HA about 50 microns thick, which was applied using a plasma spray technique. The bone adjacent to the HA coated implant also appeared to be better organized and had a higher degree of mineralization than the bone adjacent to control implants which lacked the HA coating. Kay et al. (Abstracts of the 12th Annual Meeting of the Society for Biomaterials, pp. 13, 1986) disclosed the use of HA-coated smooth titanium and cobalt-chrome-molybdenum (Co-Cr-Mo) implants using a modified plasma spray process. Kay et al. report that the coating was of a high density; however, the outermost 15-20% of the coating was less dense due to the nature of the deposition process. W. R. Lacefield, (Abstracts of the 12th Annual Meeting of the Society for Biomaterials, pp. 12, 1986) compared the coating of sintered alumina, titanium, and the alloys Ti-6Al-4V and Co-Cr-Mo by a dip process and by sputter coating using an Argon beam in a vacuum chamber. The dipping process comprised a repeated dipping of the test specimens in a slurry containing 3-5  mesh HA powder which was then fired at 1100-1200° C. for 1-3 hours. The sputter coating was accomplished by cleaning the materials first by use of an Argon ion beam, followed by sputter coating using a 6 inch diameter target of dense HA placed in the path of Argon ions (typically having energy of 2-3 kev) while the target was arranged on a rotating wheel. The sputter process was continued for 17-20 hours and produced a coating of 0.5-2.2 microns. Lacefield disclosed that dip coating had an adverse effect on the microstructure of the coated materials. This was due to an uncontrolled grain growth on the alumina, titanium and titanium alloy, and a massive carbide precipitation on the Co-Cr-Mo alloy. This led to low bone strengths and fracturing when the implant went from a high temperature (500° C.) to water. The sputter coated material, however, demonstrated a uniform thickness covering all topological features of the substrate and a high integrity of the HA coating. However, X-ray diffraction demonstrated that some sputter-coated implants had coatings which were not crystalline HA, but were primarily an amorphous calcium-phosphate layer. All of the above prior art techniques suffer from the disadvantage that they form a brittle layer of deposited material which can easily break off. Additionally, the production of a rough and irregular coating by the prior art techniques can lead to irritation of the tissue in the area where the implant is applied, if growth occurs there. Moreover, the prior art techniques cannot be applied to threaded implant configurations such as screws or total hip replacements. Therefore, what is needed is an improved process for coating materials for use in implants which overcomes the drawbacks and difficulties mentioned above in the prior art processes. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved process for manufacturing synthetic bone-coated implant material. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a surgical implant material coated with HA for use in dental and surgical fields. The present invention relates to an improved process for depositing HA on the surface of materials suitable for implantation into animals, particularly mammals (including humans). These materials, including but not limited to titanium alloys and cobalt-chrome-molybdenum alloys, are sputter coated with calcium hydroxylapatite using a high energy Xenon ion beam. This produces a coated surgical implant which is close to the proper hardness of natural bone and has an appropriate phosphate to calcium ratio. The HA is deposited as a thin layer which is not cracked or pitted. In one embodiment, the present invention is used to apply a hydroxylapatite coating on dental or surgical implants. The Xenon ion beam has between 2 and 200 kev of energy and the entire process is conducted under a vacuum in the presence of a preselected amount of water vapor.",

    "abstract": "The present invention broadly relates to chemical modification of biologically active proteins or analogs thereof (the term “protein” as used herein is synonymous with “polypeptide” or “peptide” unless otherwise indicated). More specifically, the present invention describes novel methods for site-specific chemical modifications of various proteins, and resultant compositions. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Due to recent advances in genetic and cell engineering technologies, proteins known to exhibit various pharmacological actions in vivo are capable of production in large amounts for pharmaceutical applications. Such proteins include erythropoietin (EPO), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), interferons (alpha, beta, gamma, consensus), tumor necrosis factor binding protein (TNFbp), interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), kerantinocyte growth factor (KGF), stem cell factor (SCF), megakaryocyte growth differentiation factor (MGDF), osteoprotegerin (OPG), glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and obesity protein (OB protein). OB protein may also be referred to herein as leptin. Leptin is active in vivo in both ob/ob mutant mice (mice obese due to a defect in the production of the OB gene product) as well as in normal, wild type mice. The biological activity manifests itself in, among other things, weight loss. See generally, Barinaga, “Obese” Protein Slims Mice,  Science  269: 475-476 (1995) and Friedman, “The Alphabet of Weight Control,”  Nature  385: 119-120 (1997). It is known, for instance, that in ob/ob mutant mice, administration of leptin results in a decrease in serum insulin levels, and serum glucose levels. It is also known that administration of leptin results in a decrease in body fat. This was observed in both ob/ob mutant mice, as well as non-obese normal mice. Pelleymounter et al.,  Science  269: 540-543 (1995); Halaas et al.,  Science  269: 543-546 (1995). See also, Campfield et al.,  Science  269: 546-549 (1995) (Peripheral and central administration of microgram doses of leptin reduced food intake and body weight of ob/ob and diet-induced obese mice but not in db/db obese mice.) In none of these reports have toxicities been observed, even at the highest doses. Preliminary leptin induced weight loss experiments in animal models predict the need for a high concentration leptin formulation with chronic administration to effectively treat human obesity. Dosages in the milligram protein per kilogram body weight range, such as 0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg/day or below, are desirable for injection of therapeutically effective amounts into larger mammals, such as humans. An increase in protein concentration is thus necessary to avoid injection of large volumes, which can be uncomfortable or possibly painful to the patient. Unfortunately, for preparation of a pharmaceutical composition for injection in humans, it has been observed that the leptin amino acid sequence is insoluble at physiologic pH at relatively high concentrations, such as above about 2 mg active protein/milliliter of liquid. The poor solubility of leptin under physiological conditions appears to contribute to the formation of leptin precipitates at the injection site in a concentration dependent manner when high dosages are administered in a low pH formulation. Associated with the observed leptin precipitates is an inflammatory response at the injection site which includes a mixed cell infiltrate characterized by the presence of eosinophils, macrophages and giant cells. To date, there have been no reports of stable preparations of human OB protein at concentrations of at least about 2 mg/ml at physiologic pH, and further, no reports of stable concentrations of active human OB protein at least about 50 mg/ml or above. The development of leptin forms which would allow for high dosage without the aforementioned problems would be of great benefit. It is therefore one object of the present invention to provide improved forms of leptin by way of site-specific chemical modification of the protein. There are several methods of chemical modification of useful therapeutic proteins which have been reported. One such method, succinylation, involves the conjugation of one or more succinyl moieties to a biologically active protein. Classic approaches to succinylation traditionally employ alkaline reaction conditions with very large excesses of succinic anhydride. The resultant succinyl-protein conjugates are typically modified at multiple sites, often show altered tertiary and quaternary structures, and occasionally are inactivated. The properties of various succinylated proteins are described in Holcenberg et al.,  J. Biol. Chem,  250:4165-4170 (1975), and WO 88/01511 (and references cited therein), published Mar. 10, 1988. Importantly, none of the cited references describe methods wherein the biologically active protein is monosuccinylated exclusively at the N-terminus of the protein, and wherein the resultant composition exhibits improved solubility and improved injection site toxicity&#39;s. Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid anhydride (DTPA) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid dianhydride (hereinafter referred to as EDTA 2 ) have classically been used to introduce metal chelation sites into proteins for the purpose of radiolabeling. Similar to succinylation, modification with DTPA and/or EDTA 2  typically occurs at multiple sites throughout the molecule and changes the charge and isoelectric point of the modified protein. To date, there have been no reports of DTPA- and/or EDTA 2 -protein monomers and dimers which exhibit improved solubility and improved injection site toxicity&#39;s. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to substantially homogenous preparations of chemically modified proteins, e.g. leptin, and methods therefor. Unexpectedly, site-specific chemical modification of leptin demonstrated advantages in bioavailibility and biocompatibility which are not seen in other leptin species. Importantly, the methods described herein are broadly applicable to other proteins (or analogs thereof), as well as leptin. Thus, as described below in more detail, the present invention has a number of aspects relating to chemically modifying proteins (or analogs thereof) as well as specific modifications of specific proteins. In one aspect, the present invention relates to a substantially homogenous preparation of mono-succinylated leptin (or analog thereof) and related methods. Importantly, the method described results in a high yield of monosuccinylated protein which is modified exclusively at the N-terminus, thereby providing processing advantages as compared to other species. And, despite the modest N-terminal modification, the monosubstituted succinyl-leptin unexpectedly demonstrated: 1) a substantial improvement in solubility; 2) preservation of secondary structure, in vitro receptor binding activity and in vivo bioefficacy; and 3) amelioration of the severe injection site reactions observed with administration of high concentrations of unmodified leptin. In another aspect, the present invention relates to substantially homogenous preparations of DTPA-leptin monomers and dimers and related methods. When reacted with leptin at neutral pH and a low stoichiometric excess of DTPA:protein, this reagent unexpectedly forms a single crosslink between the N-termini of two leptin molecules in high yield. When the monosubstituted DTPA-leptin monomer and dimer are isolated, both show substantially increased solubility&#39;s relative to the unmodified protein. Both forms also demonstrate preservation of in vitro receptor binding activity and in vivo bioefficacy. Significantly, the dimeric form of monosubstituted DTPA-leptin did not precipitate when injected at high concentration in PBS and demonstrated strong improvement in the injection site reactions over those observed with the unmodified leptin. In yet another aspect, the present invention relates to substantially homogenous preparations of EDTA dianhydride (EDTA 2 )-leptin monomers and dimers and related methods. Similar to DTPA in structure, EDTA 2  crosslinks leptin efficiently through the N-terminus when allowed to react at neutral pH in a substoichiometric excess. The isolated EDTA 2 -leptin dimer demonstrates dramatically enhanced solubility relative to unmodified leptin and maintains full in vitro receptor binding activity and in vivo bioactivity. Furthermore, the EDTA 2 -leptin conjugate did not precipitate at the injection site when dosed at high concentration in PBS and demonstrated substantial improvement in the adverse injection site reactions observed with the unmodified leptin.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a training apparatus for racket sports and, in particular, to a training apparatus for tennis and squash, which permits an individual to improve his skills with practice in a relatively small area. 2. Description of the Relevant Art In order to improve the skills of an individual engaging in racket sports such as tennis, squash and the like many different types of training equipment have been devised. One such device includes a flat rigid surface disposed as right angles to the horizontal. An individual strikes a ball which impinges upon the hard surface and the ball bounces off the surface and returns to the individual to be hit again and again. The timing of the returned ball utilizing this type of device in a confined area bears no relationship to the actual response time required when engaging in the actual sport thus, its training usefulness is limited. Another type of device utilizes a tennis ball which has affixed thereto an elastic band that in turn is connected to a weight resting on the ground. Striking the ball with the racket causes the ball to travel a distance determined by the length of the elastic band and its resiliency and is returned to the individual striking the ball. However, the return path of the ball bears no relation to the actual return on a court in which the game is played. Thus, each time the ball is struck it must be lifted and hit again by the individual, thereby being of limited training value. Still another type of training device is disclosed in Swedish Pat. No. 355,727 that utilizes a curved shock absorbing surface toward which the ball is aimed. The shock absorbing surface absorbs most of the ball&#39;s energy and deflects it downwardly toward a rebound surface whereupon it is returned to the individual who may keep the ball in motion by repeatingly striking it each time it is returned to him. Here again, the training value is limited since the time of return of the ball bears no relationship to the actual time of return in a conventional game of squash or tennis. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention overcomes the shortcomings found in the prior art by providing a type of training equipment which may be utilized to improve the skills of an individual. The apparatus utilizes a lightweight frame and a flexible cloth which absorbs the kenetic energy of a ball impinging thereon and is sloped to cause the ball to move upwardly until it strikes against a rebound surface wherein it then returns to the individual to be hit again and again. The time delay caused by the cloth absorbing the kenetic energy of the ball and the travel time until it strikes the rebound surface can be made to approximate the normal return time found in tennis and squash when returned by an opposing player. The return speed of the ball is essentially independent of the speed of the ball when it is struck or it contacts the cloth. A training apparatus for racket sports such as tennis, squash or the like, according to the principles of the present invention, comprises a frame having a curved portion at the upper end thereof. The frame is adjustable in length and is provided with a support portion for disposing the frame at a plurality of angles from a horizontal support surface. A rebound surface is disposed across the width of the frame at the distal edge of the curved portion. A flexible material is attached to the rebound surface and extends loosely across the width and length of the frame. The material is also attached to the lower corners of the frame and its longitudinal tautness is adjusted by adjusting the frame length. The foregoing and other objects and advantages will appear from the description to follow. In the description reference is made to the accompanying drawing which forms a part hereof, and in which is shown by way of illustration a specific embodiment in which the invention may be practiced. This embodiment will be described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the invention, and it is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and the structural changes may be made without departing from the scope of the invention. The following detailed description is, therefore, not to be taken in a limiting sense, and the scope of the present invention is best defined by the appended claims.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a medical device which includes a stopper assembly for use with an arterial blood gas syringe and blood collection tube holder and needle to obtain blood sample from a patient. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Blood samples are commonly obtained from a patient using either an arterial blood gas syringe for obtaining arterial blood samples from a patient or by using a vacuum blood collection tube and blood collection tube holder for obtaining venous blood samples from a patient. In the field of arterial blood gas syringes, numerous designs have been developed in an effort to prevent exposure of a collected blood sample to the atmosphere or to allow for the removal of contaminant gases from the syringe as the blood sample is being drawn. Arterial blood gas syringes typically include a syringe barrel, a standard needle and a plunger rod with a piston member on the distal end thereof. In many of these syringes, the piston member and/or the plunger rod include a venting structure to prevent oxygen or carbon dioxide from reacting with the arterial blood sample so that an accurate measurement of the components of the blood sample may be performed. U.S. Pat. No. 4,615,341 granted to Marzolf et al; U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,373,535 and 4,448,206 granted to Martell and U.S. Pat. No. 4,572,210 granted to McKinnon are illustrative of some of the arterial blood gas syringe designs which include a venting structure associated with the syringe. These devices are designed to allow the physician or nurse to obtain the desired blood sample directly from an artery of the patient by piercing the skin of the patient with the preattached needle. Another approach to obtaining a blood sample from a patient is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 4,192,320 granted to Megahed. The Megahed patent discloses the use of an adaptor for use with a conventional syringe assembly and a conventional blood collection tube holder to obtain a blood sample from the vein of the patient. The adaptor is described as being of a conventional elastomeric, self-sealing material which is frictionally retained on the distal end of the conventional syringe assembly. Once the adaptor has been placed on the distal end of the conventional syringe assembly, this combination is inserted into a blood collection tube holder which has previously been inserted into the vein of the patient. The adaptor and syringe assembly are then inserted into the blood collection tube holder until the proximal end of the double ended needle on the blood collection tube holder pierces the adaptor. The blood sample is then obtained from the vein of the patient by a combination of the patient&#39;s venous pressure plus the retraction of the plunger of the syringe assembly to aspirate the blood into the syringe chamber. Once a sufficient venous blood sample has been obtained, the adaptor and syringe assembly are removed from the blood collection tube holder and the collected venous blood sample is then analyzed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION One object of the present invention is to provide a stopper assembly having a needle piercable diaphragm member therein to prevent exposure of the blood sample to atmospheric air once it has been collected. Another object of the present invention is to provide a stopper assembly which will assist in aligning the distal end of the syringe with the proximal end of the double ended needle on the blood collection tube holder. A further object of the present invention is to provide an improved method for obtaining an arterial blood sample from a patient. As described more fully hereinafter, one form of the present invention includes a stopper assembly which is designed to be frictionally retained on the distal end of an arterial blood gas syringe to enable the assembly to be inserted into a blood collection tube holder. In its preferred form, the stopper assembly consists of a two-piece housing having a diaphragm member centrally positioned therebetween. The preferred arterial blood gas syringe is a commercial product known as the MARZ-175 sold by Sherwood Medical Company, St. Louis, Mo., U.S.A. which is disclosed and more fully described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,615,341 granted to Marzolf et al. The blood collection tube holder consists of an elongate tubular member having an open proximal end with a plurality of finger flanges extending therefrom and a reduced diameter distal end having a double ended needle thereon. When the nurse or technician desires to obtain an arterial blood sample using the present invention, the distal portion of the double ended needle on the blood collection tube holder is inserted into the artery of the patient. The plunger of the arterial blood gas syringe is then withdrawn to a predetermined position in the syringe barrel to form a sample chamber having the desired volume. The proximal section of the stopper assembly housing is then attached to the tapered distal luer portion of the arterial blood gas syringe. The arterial blood gas syringe and the stopper assembly are then inserted through the proximal end of the blood collection tube holder until the distal section of the stopper assembly housing contacts and compresses a rubber sleeve located on the proximal portion of the double ended needle. The proximal needle point on the double ended needle then pierces the diaphragm member in the stopper assembly. The patient&#39;s arterial blood will then flow through the double ended needle and into the sample chamber. As the arterial blood sample flows into the sample chamber, the air in the sample chamber will be forced through the venting structure in the arterial blood gas syringe until only the arterial blood sample remains in the sample chamber. Once the desired blood sample is obtained, the arterial blood gas syringe and the stopper assembly are removed from the blood collection tube holder. The blood sample is then transported to the laboratory where the technician may either remove the stopper assembly from the arterial blood gas syringe or pierce the diaphragm member of the stopper assembly to inject the blood sample into the analyzer. An advantage of the present invention is that the stopper assembly of the present invention may be used with nearly any syringe or blood collection tube holder.

    "abstract": "This invention relates to an extended release pharmaceutical composition of Levetiracetam with once a day dosage regime and the process of preparing it. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART The use of high viscosity grade hydrophilic and the hydrophobic polymers to produce extended or controlled release pharmaceutical composition is known in the art. For extending the release, the tablet comprising the drug also comprises of high viscosity grade hydrophilic polymer. If required the tablets are coated with hydrophobic polymer and pore forming agent. As soon as the solid dosage form comes in contact with the surrounding media, pores are formed and the drug is diffused through these pores. The media enters the tablet core and results into the hydration of the polymer which also controls the release of the drug. Control of the rate of release benefits therapy by producing constant blood plasma levels of the active ingredient and by decreasing the frequency of administration, thereby improving the patient compliance to the dosage regimen. The present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition of extended release tablets of Levetiracetam suitable for once daily administration to human subjects. It is known that the absorption and bioavailability of any particular therapeutic agent can be affected by numerous factors when dosed orally. Such factors include the presence of food in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract because, in general, the gastric residence time of a drug is usually significantly longer in the presence of food than in the fasted state. If the bioavailability of a drug is affected beyond a certain point due to the presence of food in the GI tract, the drug is said to exhibit a “food effect”. Food effects are important inasmuch as, when a drug exhibits an adverse food effect, there is risk associated with administering it to a patient who has eaten recently. The risk derives from the potential that absorption into the bloodstream may be adversely affected to the point that the patient risks insufficient absorption to remediate the condition for which the drug was administered. Levetiracetam is chemically named as (−)-(S)-α-ethyl-2-oxo-1-pyrrolidine acetamide with molecular formula C 8 H 14 N 2 O 2  and molecular weight 170.21. Levetiracetam is white to off white crystalline powder and has aqueous solubility of 104 gm/ml. It is freely soluble in chloroform (65.3 g/100 mL) and in methanol (53.6 g/100 mL), soluble in ethanol (16.5 g/100 mL), sparingly soluble in acetonitrile (5.7 g/100 mL) and practically insoluble in n-hexane. Levetiracetam is described in the U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,837,223, 4,943,639 and 6,107,492. Levetiracetam is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial onset seizures in adults with epilepsy. The precise mechanism(s) by which Levetiracetam exerts its antiepileptic effect is unknown and does not appear to derive from any interaction with known mechanisms involved in inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission. Levetiracetam is rapidly absorbed with the oral bioavailability of 100%. Food does not affect the extent of absorption of Levetiracetam but it decreases cmax by 20% and delays Tmax by 1.5 hours. The pharmacokinetics of Levetiracetam are linear over a dose range of 500-5000 mg, with steady state kinetics being achieved 2 days after multiple twice daily dosing. It is less than 10% bound to plasma proteins. Levetiracetam has plasma elimination half life of 7±1 hr with the volume of distribution of 0.6 L/Kg. The total body clearance is 0.9 ml/min/kg and the renal clearance is 0.6 ml/min/kg. Its elimination is correlated with creatinine clearance. There is no age, gender, race or circadian effect. Presently Levetiracetam is administered to adults as conventional immediate release tablets. The current dosing regimen includes twice daily administration. Levetiracetam is available as an immediate release and is approved for sale in various countries including the United States of America under the brand name KEPPRA™ (UCB Pharma.). KEPPRA™ is available in 250, 500 and 750 mg strengths as the immediate release tablet formulation. In the Biopharmaceutics Classification System, it belongs to Class I since it is highly soluble (1.04 g/ml), highly permeable (F&gt;90%) and &gt;85% of the tablet amount released in 15 minutes in three different pH media. Clinically, it does not belong to narrow therapeutic class because it has a relatively low order of toxicity and a relatively high therapeutic index. The twice daily dosing regimen for immediate-release Levetiracetam tablets is well tolerated with few incidences of neuropsychiatric adverse events like, somnolence, fatigue, coordination difficulties and behavioral abnormalities. The adverse effects are proportionate to the drug plasma level and therefore for improving the therapeutic efficacy, reducing incidences of adverse events and enhancing patient compliance an extended release once-daily regimen is explored in the present invention. WO 01/51033 provides for a Solid pharmaceutical compound that can be administered orally, permitting controlled release of at least one active substance which can be Levetiracetam consisting of a homogeneous mixture comprising active substance, at least one matrix excipient between 5 and 95% by weight in relation to total weight of the compound, selected among the inert matrices, the hydrophilic, or lipid matrices, mixtures of inert and lipidic matrices mixture of hydrophilic and inert matrices; at least one entero-soluble polymer between 2 and 50% by weight in relation to the total weight of the compound and at least one alkalinizing agent soluble in a aqueous phase under conditions of physiological pH, of at least 0.5 to 50% by weight in relation to the total weight of the compound. WO 03/101428 provides for a method for the manufacture of a pharmaceutical compound with retarded release of the active principle, which can be Levetiracetam. A mixture of active substance and the polymer that provides the retarded release are compressed by putting them through two rollers that have a temperature of more than 40° C. and compaction force is exerted on it of more than 15 to 40 kN/cm roller width. The compressed mixture is powdered to the desired particle size and if required the process is repeated. OBJECTIVES OF INVENTION The object of the present invention is to provide an extended release pharmaceutical composition of Levetiracetam, which upon ingestion results in blood plasma levels having plateau effect, for an extended period of time Another object of the present invention is to produce a pharmaceutical composition which releases Levetiracetam in predetermined manner. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide extended release pharmaceutical composition of Levetiracetam for once daily dosage regimen. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a extended release composition of Levetiracetam which does not exhibit food effect. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an extended release composition of Levetiracetam which shows reduced inter subject variability. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to compositions of and processes of preparing an extended release pharmaceutical composition of Levetiracetam which comprises Levetiracetam, optionally a binder, hydrophilic rate controlling polymer and conventional pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, the blend is compressed into a tablet and the formed tablet is further coated with a functional coating comprising of a hydrophobic rate controlling polymer. The functional coating optionally comprises of a channeling agent which can be a hydrophilic polymer or a water soluble substance. The composition may be further coated with a polymer based non functional coating. The components are selected in such a way to give extended release of Levetiracetam in a predetermined manner.",

    "abstract": "Generally, the invention relates to exercise devices which permit a swimmer to be retained in a generally stationary position within a body of water, such as a swimming pool, during performance of a conventional swimming action. More specifically, the invention relates to multiple part poles of such exercise devices. 2. Description of the Prior Art Numerous methods exist to exercise portions of the human body. Certain devices have been proposed which provide for the person performing the associated exercise to be in water. It has long been known that swimming is one of the very best forms of exercise. Many types of ‘strokes’, or swimming styles, are known in conventional swimming. Some of these utilize movement and exertion of the arms more than that of the legs. Some of these utilize movement and exertion of the legs more than that of the arms. Some of these utilize movement and exertion of both the arms and legs. During swimming, even through the arms and legs may appear to be performing most of the action, many muscles of the body are utilized. Therefore, a full body workout can be obtained by swimming for a reasonable period of time. Swimming is considered by many in the medical and physical fitness fields as a nearly perfect exercise for nearly all persons regardless of age or general physical condition. Unlike running, or even walking, there is no impact delivered to the feet and legs, including all of the joints contained therein, during swimming. Additionally, many styles of swimming simultaneously exercise both the arms and legs during performance of the respective swimming action. Certain land based exercise routines, such as jumping jacks, exercise, both the arms and legs simultaneously but typically such exercises due not provide desirable resistance to the limbs during performance of the exercise. Water is the ideal medium for exercise due to the nature of the water and the natural resistance to motion of objects through water. During swimming the swimmer may merely increase their speed of completing each cycle of a stroke to increase the resistance of the exercise. Additionally, during swimming it is easy to change from one selected style of swimming to another style of swimming to vary the workout routine. The fundamental problem with swimming as an exercise involves the fact that most Americans which routinely swim as an exercise do so in a swimming pool. Therefore, the swimmer will swim from one end of the pool to the opposing end, then turn one hundred and eighty (180) degrees and swim back to the then opposing end. This cycle will then be performed repetitively for the duration of the exercise routine. This constant contact with, or at least approach to, the hard perimeters of the opposing ends of the pool have obvious inherent dangers. Many swimming styles have the swimmer&#39;s face down into the water which is raised out of the water to breath and to look forward, if desired. Other swimming styles have the swimmer&#39;s face facing upward toward the sky, such as during performance of the backstroke. For these reasons it is difficult for the swimmer to constantly remain aware of their spacial orientation with the perimeter of the pool that they are approaching during movement from one end to the opposing end. Many swimming pools, particularly those associated with a individual home, are relatively small. Additionally, some swimming styles require a depth of water greater than that of the shallow end of some swimming pools. Often the swimmer desiring to perform their exercise routine in a swimming pool will have other swimmers utilizing the swimming pool for their own recreational use. For all of these reasons many persons having access to a swimming pool will not utilize the pool to the fullest extent possible for exercise. Applicant previously developed and patented, U.S. Pat. No. 4,530,497 issued Jul. 23, 1985, an exercising device which provides many of the benefits of stationary swimming exercise. Applicant has been successfully marketing products based upon applicant&#39;s earlier invention for many years. Applicant has recently made numerous improvements to his product line which are the subject matter of the present invention. Various deficiencies exist with nearly all forms of exercise and devices to facilitate each respective form of exercise. Applicant&#39;s previous invention, and products based upon that invention, provide for the optimal exercise routine in an extremely safe manner. Various minor disadvantages exist with applicant&#39;s prior invention and products based upon that invention. These minor disadvantages are particularly related to shipping and distribution of such products and transport and storage of such products by the end user. As such, it may be appreciated that there continues to be a need for a versatile and transportable swimming exercise device. The present invention substantially fulfills these needs.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to fire protection systems and specifically to a novel inflatable bag apparatus for deploying gaseous and vaporizable fire extinguishing and explosion suppression agents. Several basic mechanisms for effecting fire extinguishing and explosion suppression for various combustible fuel/oxidizer combinations exist. These are: (a) separation of fuel from the oxidizer (typically air) e.g. mechanical fire fighting foam agents; (b) dilution of oxidizer to a concentration below which it cannot support combustion e.g. with an inert gas such as helium; (c) cooling of the reactants (fuel and oxidizer) and sufficient absorption of the thermal energy output to quench the combustion process e.g. by application of water spray; and (d) the chemical inhibition of the production of free radicals essential to the sustenance of the combustion process e.g. by a chemical agent such as bromotrifluoromethane (CF3Br). Agent selection, storage, quantity and dispensing method are affected by the particular fire protection problem or application which, in turn, dictates operational (environment; habitable vs. non- habitable, etc.) and system weight, volume and cost constraints, e.g. ground facilities versus aircraft applications. In general, fire extinguishing agents are applied in either (a) a local application mode such as from a portable hand held fire extinguisher or from a turret on a fire fighting vehicle, or (b) a total flooding mode such as by the rapid distribution of a fire extinguishing agent via fixed nozzles into a confined space so as to achieve a concentration level in air throughout the entire volume sufficient for fire extinguishment. Modern aircraft turbine engine installations are representative of a confined space fire protection application and are considered natural &#34;fire zones&#34; because of the inherent presence of an ignition source(s) and the close proximity of flammable/combustible fluids such as jet fuel, engine oil and, in many instances, hydraulic fluid. The &#34;fire zone&#34; designation requires that overheat/fire detection and in the case of most multiengine aircraft, fire extinguishing systems be provided for protection of crew, passengers and equipment. These protection systems are in addition to the rigorous application of fire prevention and hardening measures such as unidirectional, high velocity air flow to purge volatile combustible fluid leaks while also reducing the likelihood of hot surface ignition, and suitable fire walls to prevent fire penetration into adjacent compartments. Fire detection systems respond in the matter of a few seconds. Fire extinguishing systems once activated also respond very rapidly and are designed to discharge a halon chemical fire extinguishing agent such as bromotrifluoromethane (CF 3  Br) into the compartment so as to achieve a certain minimum volume percent concentration (6% for CF 3  Br; varies with the particular agent used) simultaneously at all locations in the engine compartment and hold that concentration for a short time (approximately 0.5 second) to achieve extinguishment. The fire extinguishing system typically entails a bottle to store the fire extinguishing agent under pressure, an open ended distribution conduit leading to an appropriate location within the &#34;fire zone&#34; and an electro-mechanical valve or electro-explosive (squib) rupture diaphragm incorporated into the neck of the bottle for triggering release of the agent. No provision is incorporated to terminate engine compartment ventilation air in the event of fire; consequently, determination of agent quantity requirements for a particular installation entails consideration of several factors but, in particular, engine compartment free volume and ventilating air flow (as a function of flight profile). Overall agent effectiveness is reduced (quantity increased) by agent leakage out and/or air leakage into the fire control area thereby decreasing agent dwell time and by agent/air mixing inefficiencies. No apparatus is known, however, which simultaneously overcomes these agent/air mixing inefficiencies. Military and civil aircraft currently employ halon agents such as bromotrifluoromethane (Halon 1301) and bromochlorodifluoromethane (Halon 1211) in on-board fire extinguishing systems for the protection of engine installations and other areas designated as &#34;fire zones&#34;. These agents evolved from industry and principally Department of Defense (DOD) research and development efforts which were begun in the 1950&#39;s and provide outstanding fire extinguishing effectiveness and other favorable toxicologic, operational and system attributes which made them essentially the &#34;universal&#34; choice for these applications. Unfortunately, these same extinguishants, upon release into the atmosphere, have been tabbed in recent years to possess characteristics which make them extremely bad actors from the standpoint of depleting the &#34;critical&#34; ozone level in the earth&#39;s stratosphere and consequently has led to an international ban on their future production. Effective (cost and performance) alternative fire protection techniques are urgently needed for aircraft flight safety and survivability to fill the void resulting from the banning of these halon &#34;chemical&#34; extinguishants. There are several on-going efforts which are directed at the identification and evaluation of alternative and replacement materials for the Halon 1301 and 1211 agents for both aircraft and ground fire protection applications. Candidates under consideration include perfluorocarbons, hydrofluorocarbons, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, hydrobromofluorocarbons, iodofluorocarbons, dry chemicals, carbon dioxide, nitrogen and mixtures of basically inert gases. It is generally accepted that the development of &#34;true&#34; replacements for halons 1301 and 1211 for aircraft and ground applications is not imminent. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The principal objective of this invention is to provide an improved fire extinguishing apparatus or system which is capable of enhancing the effectiveness of various gaseous and vaporizable fire extinguishing agents for ventilated and confined space compartments/volumes fire scenarios by essentially reducing the availability of oxidizer (normally air) and increasing agent dwell (staying) time. This invention provides a means of overcoming the inherent short-fall in fire extinguishant effectiveness associated with current alternative agents while at the same time being amenable to the integration of chemical fire extinguishing agent advancements made by others, especially the vaporizing liquid and gaseous types of agents. Another object is to provide an apparatus which offers compact and lightweight storability while also offering design flexibility to accommodate varying volume and configuration fire protection applications. A further objective is to provide an apparatus which is amenable to various materials of construction and deployment configurations to meet the varying environmental, operational and/or space demands of a specific end application. The foregoing objects can be accomplished by providing an inflatable bag as the final element in the system for fire extinguishing agent distribution. Other objects and many of the associated advantages will readily be appreciated as the subject invention becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed description, when considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a coat which assists in the harvesting of a fleece of an animal which has been shed after biological wool harvesting. More particularly, the present invention relates to a fleece retaining coat used in the biological wool harvesting of sheep. DISCUSSION OF PRIOR ART Historically wool has been removed from sheep and other long haired animals by manual shearing using a cutter which is run over the body of the animal. This method is very labour intensive, time consuming and can be stressful for the animal. It is also known to biologically &#34;shear&#34; a sheep by administering a biological depilatory agent, such as epidermal growth factor, which causes a weakening or complete break in the wool staple at or near skin level. Other depilatory agents are disclosed in for example, CSIRO Australia Patent Applications 11737/76, 59755/80 and 73659/81. Although biological wool harvesting overcomes a number of the disadvantages of mechanical shearing, it raises problems of its own. The biological depilatory agents cause the wool to fall from the skin over a period of time, which may extend for several days. Sometimes the depilatory agent does not cause a complete break in the wool staple, but merely results in a mechanical weakening. The result of this is that the wool fleece is removed in patches and over a period of time, and it is thus strewn over a wide area if the animals are left to graze. Collecting the wool is difficult and the wool may be damaged when strewn around the grazing area. Confining the animals until all the wool drops off is impractical. It is therefore a requirement to produce a means for overcoming the above problems. To this end, it is known to produce a cover, jacket or net to be worn by the animal which protects the sheep or assists in retaining the fleece, so that the fleece may be removed in a single operation once all the wool staple has been broken. Such coats and nets have not been successful due to a number of problems. Australian patent 428078 by Gollin &amp; Co. Ltd discloses a coat which is formed from plastics sheet material, such as woven polyethylene. The coat has an elastic rump portion and non adjustable leg ties. A series of elasticised portions are used to improve the fit of the coat. This coat suffers from the disadvantage that as the wool staple breaks the wool collects under the neck and in the leg portions and belly area of the coat. This may become very uncomfortable for the sheep and can immobilise the sheep, especially if the wool is wet following rain. The additional weight of wet wool can exacerbate the problem of wool movement. Australian Patent Application 60853/73 by Gollin &amp; Co. Ltd. discloses the use of a net-like coat which consists of an open mesh material adapted to fit closely against the skin of the sheep immediately after shearing. The coat remains against the skin of the sheep, and new wool growth is supposed to extend through the mesh apertures. The principal problem with the mesh coat is that in practice the wool does not grow through the mesh but becomes matted beneath the coat. Furthermore, the animal is required to wear the coat for an extended period of time from a point shortly after shearing until the next shearing (typically 12 months). The coat is prone to damage and detachment over this long period and thus has questionable durability and reduced possibility of reuse. This application also discloses the use of an outer coat which is fitted to the sheep just before shearing. The outer coat prevents the wool from dropping from the sheep at an inappropriate point in time. There is also disclosure of using an adhesive on the inside of the outer coat to assist removal and subsequent handling of the fleece. When harvesting the fleece, both coats are removed with the fleece sandwiched between them after administering a biological depilatory agent. Such a coat is not reusable and is unlikely to be successful in practical applications due to: a) the difficulty in removing the wool from the coat, b) excessive wool movement within the coat resulting in sagging of the fleece, c) possible incapacitation of the sheep, and",

    "abstract": "The invention relates to a cultivating tool, a method of cultivating soil and a handle for a tool. More particularly the cultivating tool and method of cultivating are provided primarily for surface cultivation of soil. The tool handle of the invention is primarily intended for use as part of the cultivating tool of the invention but may also be used on other tools. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Surface cultivation of soil has in the past proved a time consuming and arduous task for a gardener, particularly where because of trees, paving stones or other obstructions it is awkward to operate upon the soil to be cultivated. The tools available for such surface cultivation have also been very limited. A tool known as a &#34;Dutch hoe&#34; has been used. This tool can be dragged across the surface of soil to be cultivated and disturbs the surface enabling weeds to be removed. Operation of such a tool is very arduous. Large powered cultivators which are able to cultivate soil to a reasonable depth are also available but these tools are expensive and large so that they cannot be used in awkward places. It has been proposed to provide a relatively small power operated cultivating tool which may be used for surface cultivation of soil, but as yet no satisfactory tool has been provided. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a cultivating tool which can be used for surface cultivation of soil not only between rows of plants or in flower beds but also in more awkward places such as adjacent trees, fences or paving stones. According to the invention there is provided a cultivating tool comprising a housing, an electric motor mounted within the housing, a pair of soil working memberw which project from the housing, the members being of generally lamellar construction and arranged to be reciprocated relative to one another transverse to the direction in which they project from the housing and in adjacent parallel planes, an elongate shaft connected at one end to the housing and extending from the housing in a direction away from the projecting blades, and a handle at the other end of the shaft. With this cultivating tool surface cultivation of soil is greatly facilitated. The transverse relative reciprocation of the soil working members in adjacent parallel planes makes penetration of the soil working members into the soil much easier; indeed in an embodiment of the invention to be described later the soil working members will penetrate normal soil merely under the force of the weight of the tool so that no external pressure is required by an operator. Preferably the electric motor is arranged to reciprocate both soil working members in opposite directions. This arrangement again assists penetration of the soil working members into the soil and also balances the tool. A respective eccentrically mounted cam member may engage each soil working member to reciprocate the members. The cam members are mounted eccentrically on opposite sides of the axis about which they are rotated. The relative reciprocation of the soil working members is preferably relative pivotal movement. The soil working members can readily be mounted in the tool housing for pivotal movement and such pivotal movement reduces the possibility of an obstruction becoming wedged between the soil working members during their pivotal movement. The soil working member may be mounted to pivot about a point located to one side of a longitudinal centre line of the member, alternatively it may be mounted to pivot about a point on the longitudinal centre line. Each soil working member may be generally fork-shaped at its outer end. The fork-shaped end of each soil working member preferably defines at least one gap between adjacent portions of the end, the width of the gap increasing towards the extremity of the member. The fork-shaped ends again facilitate penetration of the soil working members into the soil and the increasing width of the gap(s) in each member reduces the possibility of an obstruction becoming wedged between the soil working members. During a full cycle of reciprocation of the soil working members the relative movement of one soil working member relative to the other may be approximately the width of said at least one gap. When the soil working members are in their central position the gaps in the members are preferably aligned. The soil working members are preferably arranged such that when they are reciprocated relative to one another they provide a shearing action for cutting vegetation and the like. This shearing action is useful in assisting the members to pass through the roots of weeds or other vegetation that may be in the soil and also enables the tool to be used to cut grass, weeds or the like above the soil. The lateral faces of each soil working member that are involved in the shearing action are preferably relatively thick so that they are not easily damaged. The tool housing may have an exterior base surface for supporting the tool on the ground, the base surface being inclined at an acute angle to the planes of the soil working members. With such an arrangement, when the base surface is rested on the ground the soil working members are inclined downwardly towards the soil at an angle close to that at which they are intended to work. The shaft of the tool may be inclined at an angle of about 45° to the planes of the soil working members. While the tool is normally used with the soil working members almost horizontal it may sometimes be advantageous to use the tool with the working members approximately vertical. In such a case the orientation of the tool is changed by 90° but the shaft of the tool is again inclined at an angle of about 45°. Preferably the handle is arranged for the tool to be held in either of these two orientations. The handle may include switch means for controlling operation of the motor. The handle may have a tubular portion, which is transverse to the elongate shaft, for gripping by an operator.",

One solution is two permanently alter a shoe by removing a portion of the shoe and changing its overall look. One such example is to remove a portion of the shoe that surrounds the ankle region to covert a high top shoe to a low-top shoe. Another method of altering a shoes appearance is to removeably clip ornamental brooches and the like on the tops of shoes. Examples of removable shoe ornaments are described in U.S. Pat. No. 7,891,117, U.S. Pat. No. 7,895,774 and U.S. Design Pat. No. 649,340. However, these solutions fail to meet the needs of the industry because they are aimed at adding ornamentation to a shoe and not changing the overall shoe type. It would be desirable to have a system and method that enables people to have a couple of style options without having to buy multiple styles of shoes. Therefore, there currently exists a need in the industry for a system and device that can be easily converted to change footwear. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Various example embodiments of the invention advantageously fill the aforementioned deficiencies by providing a shoe conversion system which provides multiple style options with only one pair of shoes. In one example embodiment, a shoe has removable pieces that allow a wearer to choose from a boot or a shoe style. The shoe gives the wearer two options of changing the look of the shoe from a boot to a regular high heel. This shoe gives options to the wearer with one item. In this example embodiment, a user can zip or unzip the top piece to change the look of your shoe while it&#39;s still on the user&#39;s foot. In another example embodiment, a method is provided for transforming a shoe to a boot or vice versa without the use of tools for the conversion. The invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, which are intended to be read in conjunction with both this summary, the detailed description and any preferred and/or particular embodiments specifically discussed or otherwise disclosed.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to an ophthalmologic examination apparatus having a plurality of ophthalmologic examination functions. 2. Description of the Prior Art A variety of ophthalmologic examination apparatuses such as fundus cameras and perimeters are conventionally known. A cameras as disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 3359126 is, for example, provided with functions whereby an illuminated eye fundus is once imaged, then magnified and imaged again in the imaging region of a CCD in order to create images of the eye fundus having different magnification ratios. Similarly, a fundus cameras is also known from Japanese Laid-open Patent Application 1979-62691 wherein an illuminated eye fundus can be imaged, the resulting image can be magnified, and the image of the eye fundus can subsequently be divided in a position conjugate with the pupil for stereographical observation. A fundus camera is also known from Japanese Laid-open Patent Application 1998-155743 wherein a photography unit for photographing an eye fundus is provided separately from a main unit that houses an illuminating optical system and a photographing optical system and an ocular lens are provided on the photography unit side. However, several problems arise in conventional ophthalmologic examination apparatuses. For example, the apparatuses are primarily intended for a single ophthalmologic examination wherein an eye fundus is observed or imaged, or a visual field is examined. This does not allow various ophthalmologic examinations to be performed. Furthermore, the optical systems of apparatuses that perform a variety of ophthalmologic examinations are complex. Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide an ophthalmologic examination apparatus that is capable of performing a variety of ophthalmologic examinations with an inexpensive arrangement. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An ophthalmologic examination apparatus according to the present invention has a plurality of ophthalmologic examination functions and comprises a main unit for housing an illuminating optical system for illuminating a fundus of an eye to be examined and an imaging optical system for imaging the illuminated fundus of the eye to be examined, and a plurality of attachment units that are removably mounted to the main unit. Each of the attachment units is provided with a different ophthalmologic function to provide a different ophthalmologic function in accordance with the attachment unit mounted to the main unit. In the present invention, an illuminating optical system for illuminating an eye fundus and an imaging optical system for imaging the illuminated eye fundus, which are both necessary in an ophthalmologic examination, are housed in a main unit. A variety of ophthalmologic examination functions are given to an attachment unit that is mounted to the main unit via a mount. Therefore, a variety of ophthalmologic examinations can be performed merely by selecting the attachment unit and mounting it to the main unit. For example, the attachment unit is provided with a function for planarly or stereographically observing or photographing an imaged eye fundus, a function for emitting stimulating light onto the eye fundus, or a function for spectroscopically analyzing the eye fundus. Merely selecting and mounting it to the fundus camera, an ophthalmologic examination apparatus is provided that is capable of performing an ERG examination or a spectroscopic analysis examination or a visual field examination. Such an ophthalmologic examination apparatus shares most of elements or devices in the main unit and provides a multifunctional, remarkably low-cost examination apparatus. Further features of the invention, its nature and various advantages will be more apparent from the accompanying drawings and following detailed description of the invention.",

    "abstract": "The present invention provides controlled defibrating and optimum dewatering results. According to the invention, a defibrating element directly adjoins the body of a first screw. Controlled defibrating is made possible by this special defibrating element. A favorable further development of the invention is characterized by the defibrating element having a conical shape. With this conical design, the pressure build up is improved and thus, better dewatering is achieved. An advantageous configuration of the invention is characterized by the defibrating element containing ribs, where the ribs are mounted at an angle to the screw axis. With the defibrating ribs, defibrating can be controlled even more effectively and some conveying effect also achieved at the same time. A favorable further development of the invention is characterized by the conical defibrating element being surrounded by a conical casing, where the conical casing can have internal ribs which advantageously form an angle to the screw axis. The combination of conical defibrating element and conical casing provides a defined, constant gap through which the material is conveyed or pressed. Thus, it is possible to control defibrating even more effectively. A favorable configuration of the invention is characterized by a movable defibrating element which can be displaced in axial direction or alternatively, a conical casing that can be moved in axial direction. Since either the defibrating element or the casing can be displaced, the gap can be set while the machine is in operation. An advantageous further development of the invention is characterized by the conical casing having openings, for example drilled holes or slits, for the liquid to drain off. In this way, more liquid can be removed in this part of the machine. A favorable configuration of the invention is characterized by a further screw adjoining the defibrating element. This is used to further compress the material and achieve even better dewatering. An advantageous further development of the invention is characterized by the shaft of the further screw containing drill holes which are connected to a hole drilled through the center of this shaft, where the hole in the center of this shaft continues through the defibrating element to the shaft of the first screw and can be connected to openings in this shaft. As a result, the steam which builds up in the final section can be used conveniently to pre-heat the material. An alternative configuration of the invention is characterized by a pressure casing being mounted over the further screw, the defibrating element and the end of the first screw, where the pressure casing can be connected to a pipe containing a device to pre-heat the material. Thus, the material can be pre-heated before entering the device as a whole. A further alternative configuration is characterized by the defibrating element and/or the conical casing containing grooves to re-circulate the steam.

    "abstract": "This invention relates to rotary lawn mowers and particularly to rotary mowers including means for adjusting rotary knife blades to various cutting widths and having two recutting elements in addition to two primary cutting means. The new adjustable rotary mower arm and knife blades assembly comprises a straight rotary mower arm of a predetermined length, width and material thickness with opposing, downward angled, overlapping flanges along the side of each mower arm. The mower arm has a pivot center hole for mounting the arm to the drive shaft of the move, a longitudinal drive pin clearance slot along the mower arm&#39;s center line on either side of the pivot center, and on each arm end, in symmetry with each other and equally spaced from the mower arm center, a pair of basically rectangular knife blades suspension hooks which are located along the mower arm&#39;s longitudinal center line with their gate entrances facing the mower arm&#39;s pivot center. The basically horizontal mower arm hook sections are equally spaced from each other in each hook set and provided with threaded screw holes and downward facing screw elements which are accessed from the mower arm bottom to clamp the knife blades to the top surface of the mower arm. Access to the downwardly facing screws is provided by clamping tool clearance holes in the knife blades&#39; bridge sections which separate two adjacent suspension hook clearance holes. Straight cutting width related trailing edges are firmly seated against the straight inside of the suspension hook&#39;s vertical leg sections. The tool access holes are concentric with the hooks&#39; larger screw holes. Centrifugal forces keep both knives in position, thus preventing any knife separation from the mower arm if the clamp screws become loose or lost. The two twin-edged, bi-functional, dual-tapered, multi-positional knife blades are identical with each other in design and size. They are placed on the mower arm top and clamped against it with set screws tightened in counter-clockwise direction. Each knife features a flat, level center section with multiple sets of lengthwise extended, equally sized pairs of rectangular clearance holes of which the two first and second holes in each neighboring set are spaced at the same equal distance from each other as a matching mower arm hook. Provision is made for the knife blades&#39; cutting width related engagement with their coordinated matching pairs of mower arm suspension hooks. The cutting width choices are determined by the number of corresponding clearance holes in each set pattern. The set on one knife blade side is located by the smallest cutting width increment closer to its nearest knife blade end than the hole set on the other side to the opposite knife blade end. The smallest incremental increase or decrease in cutting width requires each knife blade to be reversed end for end prior to its re-engagement with its corresponding pair of mower arm suspension hooks. Repositioning the knife blades in single step increments without their prior end for end reversal changes the cutting width twice as much. The number of cutting width knife blade settings can be increased by enlarging the number of equally spaced holes in each clearance hole set and by proportionately lengthening the mower arm and knife blade length. The hook spacing in each hook pair, and each hook pair&#39;s distance from its respective mower arm end remains unchanged. The uniform knife blade design also features a downward pitched, leading cutting leg and an equally sized, upwardly raised, trailing leg on its correlated, peripheral mower arm end, and a conversely angled, leading and trailing set of legs on the opposite knife blade end. The outside located knife sections cut and lift the grass and loose leaves while the inward faced knife sections re-cut the air borne material before releasing it onto the mowed lawn as organic fertilizer. When the leading cutting edges become dull, the knife blades are turned 180° about their horizontal axis. This motion converts their sharp trailing edges into primary cutting and secondary mulching edges respectively. This lengthens the life of the knife blades at a reduced number of knife blade resharpenings. In order to adapt the new mower arm and knife blades assembly to as many different lawn mower brands and sizes as possible, the mower arm is provided with the largest, most popular center hole together with a set of matching reducer washers featuring a variety of inner hole sizes to fit the most common mower drive shaft adapter stud and bolt sizes. The overlapping mower arm flanges increase the arm stiffness, thus permitting a reduction in the width and weight of the mower arms and knife blades. The material thickness of the mower arms may also be reduced. Additional rigidity may be given to the mower arm and equally angled, firmly seated leading primary knife blade sections by extending the flanges over the entire mower arm length. This flange support, which diminishes with greater than minimum cutting width settings, comes in addition to each knife&#39;s greater rigidity already provided by its four angled cutting sections. By shaping its downward facing edges at the same angle as each knife&#39;s primary cutting edges, the mower arm flanges can be converted into auxiliary primary cutting knives. In summary, this new and improved adjustable mower arm and knife blade assembly offers the following main advantages over non-adjustable, single component rotary knife blades which constitute objects of this invention: 1. A combination of primary lawn cutting and re-cutting means for grass clippings; 2. A choice of multiple cutting width settings; 3. A substantial reduction in knife re-sharpenings, and thus a conversely longer life for the twin-edged knife section; 4. A simplified knife sharpening process; 5. A reduction in the lawn mower dealer&#39;s large and costly inventory of conventional lawn mower knife blades, which all differ in design and size from one another; and 6. A narrower and lighter flanged mower arm and lighter matching knife blades.",

    "abstract": "When spraying crops with chemical agents such as insecticides, fungicides, and the like, a problem resides in that the plants must be sprinkled on all surfaces as uniformly as possible, and for this reason, the chemical agent is usually atomized. This, however leads to the disadvantage that the wind may interfere whereby the mist is carried away by the wind and deposited in the wrong places. Additionally, many crops grow into an interwoven tangle so that penetration by sprays is virtually impossible. As such, the underside of the crops remain susceptible to desease and the like with only the tops thereof being protected. As a consequence, economic factors as well as considerations regarding the damage to environment due to the excessive use of potentially hazardous spraying agents have promoted the development of more efficient methods and implements for reducing the required dose rates by ensuring a correct deposition of the spraying agent. Forced air streams have long been known as an invaluable method of constraining, transporting and depositing sprays for crop protection. Machinery developed for air-assisted spraying ranges from small hand-held devices to large, heavy duty equipment on wheels used to spray bush, vine and tree crops, and broadacre ground crops. Early examples of such machinery are disclosed in British patent no. 685,211 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,804,332 none of which gained much popularity due to their heavy-weight boom structure which reduced the maximum possible boom width. The same applies to the sprayer disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,274,589 and 3,472,454 which are both cumbersome in use. In the past decade a number of air-assisted sprayers have been developed, examples of which are described in European patent no. 272,740 (Van den Munckhof), U.S. Pat. No. 5,098,018 (Degania sprayers), Australian patent application no. 14,546/83 (Degania sprayers) and U.S. Pat. No. 4,927,080 (Hartvig Jensen &amp; Co.). These sprayers comprise a spray boom carrying and air blower an an elongated, flexible sheet provided with an air discharge, either as a slit-like outlet or a series of perforations. Nozzles for spraying a spraying agent are situated alongside the air-flow generating means. Moreover, U.S. Pat. No. 4,982,898 discloses an agricultural sprayer having a rigid outer tube with a flexible, internal air duct. Reference is made to the above patents, and the above US patents are hereby incorporated in the present specification by reference. 2. Description of the Related Art It is an object of the present invention to provide an agricultural spraying system which allows for a greater flexibility and which may be employed in an increased number of applications. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a spraying system having means for providing a controlled air outflow. An advantage of the agricultural sprayer system according to the present invention is that the air distribution pattern of the air-flow generating means may be varied in a particularly simple manner, allowing the spraying system to be used for spraying different types of crops and spraying crops under varying nature and weather conditions. It is a feature of the present invention that an agricultural spraying system is provided rendering it possible, using simple means, to produce an air flow pattern which may be altered while, using the same simple means, allowing a variation of the air flow relative to the crops being sprayed and relative to the ground on which the crops are grown. According to a first aspect of the present invention, the above object, the above advantage and the above feature, together with numerous other objects, advantages and features which will be evident from the below detailed description of preferred embodiments of the agricultural spraying system according to the present invention, are obtained by means of an agricultural sprayer unit to be moved by means of a moving vehicle relative to crops to be sprayed with a chemical agent delivered from the agricultural sprayer unit and comprising: frame means connectable to the moving vehicle for connecting the agricultural sprayer unit to the moving vehicle for moving along with the moving vehicle, tank means supported by the frame means for storing the chemical agent, boom means linked to and extending from the frame means defining a specific orientation relative to the crops, nozzle means supported by and positioned along the boom means and communicating with the tank means for receiving the chemical agent from the tank means for generating an automized jet of the chemical agent to be expelled from the nozzle means and sprayed onto the crops, and air-flow generating means supported by the frame and extending along the boom means for generating an air flow directed from the air-flow generating means to the crops, the air-flow generating means being divided into a number of subsections positioned along the boom means, each subsection including a set of individual air outlets for generating a specific distribution pattern by means of the individual air outlets relative to the atomized jet of the chemical agent, and the specific air distribution patterns generated by the subsections together defining the air flow directed to the crops. The air-flow generating means of the agricultural sprayer unit according to the present invention fulfils the main purpose of generating a specific air distribution pattern by being divided into a number of subsections including respective sets of outlets rendering it possible to convert the sprayer from a specific application into another for providing a uniform air flow taking into consideration the orientation of the boom means relative to the crops, the crops themselves, the nature and also the weather conditions or alternatively providing an air flow of a specific air distribution pattern promoting the deposits of the chemical agent on the crops in question determined by the position, configuration and orientation of the air outlets of the individual subsections of the air-flow generating means. By forming the air-flow generating means with a number of subsections positioned along the boom, the air outflow may be varied by replacing a specific subsection by another thereby providing a desired overall distribution pattern. In the present context, the expression defining a specific orientation relative to the crops is to be construed a generic term which refers to the various factors which may influence the actual position of the boom means relative to the crops, as in most instances, the boom means is intentionally positioned so as to position the nozzle means supported by and positioned along the boom means in positions relative to the crops ensuring that the atomized jet of the chemical agent generated and expelled from the nozzle means and sprayed onto the crops causes the chemical agent to be deposited uniformly on the crops. Provided the crops are growing on the ground, the boom means is in most instances positioned extending substantially parallelly with the surface of the ground. In case the surface of the ground is sloping or the crops growing on the ground are not of uniform heigth, an orientation of the boom means relative to the crops differing from the above described conventional position of the boom means in substantially parallel relationship with the surface of the ground may be provided. Also other factors such as the weather conditions, the configuration of the atomized jet of the chemical agent generated by and expelled by the nozzle means may urge the user or farmer to position the boom means in a position differing from the above described usual parallel relationship relative to the surface of the ground. In order to compensate for all factors influencing the deposition of the chemical agents on the crops in accordance with the actual requirements usually involving a substantially uniform distribution of the chemical agent onto the crops, the air-flow generating means of the agricultural sprayer unit according to the present invention is divided into a number of subsections each generating a specific air distribution pattern together generating the air flow causing the intentional deposition of the chemical agents on the crops. A different application of the agricultural sprayer unit according to the present invention involves the spraying of chemical agents onto crops growing on vertical supports such as grape wine or constituting trees themselves carrying fruits or leaves which are to be sprayed by a chemical agent. Provided the agricultural sprayer unit according to the present invention is used for spraying a chemical agent onto trees, the boom means is positioned in an orientation differing from the above described parallel relationship relative to the surface of the ground. In most instances, the boom means of the agricultural sprayer unit according to the present invention is positioned in a substantially perpendicular relationship relative to the surface of the ground provided the agricultural sprayer unit is used for spraying a chemical agent onto trees, however, an orientation differing from the perpendicular relationship relative to the surface of the ground may in some instances be employed provided e.g. crowns of trees are to be sprayed by a chemical agent.",

A similar disease has also appeared in much of Europe. The disease is manifested in two forms, one causing reproductive failure and the other producing respiratory distress in young pigs. The reproductive form of the disease is described by Keffaber, K. K., &#34;Reproductive Failure of Unknown Etiology&#34;, American Association of Swine Practitioners Newsletter, 1: 109 (1989). The most prominent clinical symptoms of the reproductive form of the disease are spontaneous late-term abortions, premature births (which can be as high as 20-30% of all births) and the farrowing of mummified fetuses, stillbirth or sickly piglets. Such clinical symptoms will typically be observed in a herd from 4-16 weeks, or even longer. Stillborn fetuses in affected litters often are in the early stages 0f mummification, as evidenced by tan-brown discoloration of the skin and post-mortem autolysis. Dome-shaped malformations of fetal skulls is also sometimes seen. The infection of sows may go unnoticed, or may manifest itself by an impaired general condition lasting up to a few days. For example, the sows may go off feed, and experience body temperatures either above or below normal. In the farrowing phase, the sows may exhibit depression, lethargy, phyrexia and occasional vomiting. In some affected herds, up to 75% of all piglets may be lost. The economic consequences of the disease, accordingly, are devastating. The respiratory form of the disease exhibits clinical signs which are most pronounced in piglets of 3-8 weeks in age, but are reported to occur in pigs of all ages in infected herds. The diseased piglets grow slowly, have roughened hair coats, respiratory distress (&#34;thumping&#34;) and increased mortality (up to about 80% pre-weaning mortality). Findings in preliminary studies of gross and microscopic lesions of piglets affected with the respiratory form of the disease suggest that microscopic lung lesions are an important clinical feature of this disease. Despite pronounced respiratory symptoms of disease, lungs that appear uncomplicated by secondary bacterial infection are either grossly normal or have a mild, diffused tan-gray discoloration of the lung surface. Nevertheless, a microscopic examination of the lung tissue of PRRS-diseased piglets reveals a characteristic pattern of interstitial pneumonitis, per Collins, J. E. et al., &#34;Respiratory Disease in a Swine Herd Experiencing a Reproductive Failure Syndrome&#34;, Proceedings, Minnesota Swine Conference for Veterinarians, p. 254, St. Paul, Minn. (Sep. 10-18, 1990). Accordingly, there is a real need in the art for an effective vaccine which can eliminate or at least ameliorate the effects of PRRS. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention overcomes the problems outlined above by providing a vaccine that effectively reduces or prevents the disease caused by PRRS virus in swine. Broadly speaking, the invention includes a biologically or virally pure culture of PRRS virus together with all mutants thereof and methods of producing and using these virions. The wild-type virus is capable of causing PRRS in swine, but modified forms of the virus, or non-pathogenic mutants thereof, provide an effective vaccine against this disease. The vaccine preferably includes a live modified or attenuated virus and a pharmaceutically effective carrier agent. The modified virus is preferably propagated and maintained in a simian kidney cell line, and this cell line is most preferably MA-104 which is African Green Monkey Kidney cells passed twenty or more times. A pathogenic viral agent was recovered from the tissue homogenate of an infected pig, and confirmed by causing PRRS disease in numerous piglets and pregnant sows. A deposit of the isolated viral agent was made on Jul. 18,1991, with the American Type Cullure Collection in Rockville, Md. under the accession number ATCC-VR2332. The viral agent is a fastidious, non-hemagglutinating enveloped RNA virus. The wild-type virus is preferably modified to a substantially avirulent form by inoculating the virus on a full or partial sheet of simian cells in the presence of serum in a suitable growth medium; incubating the inoculated cell sheet at a temperature from about 35° C. to about 37° C. until a cytopathic effect is observed and repeatedly passaging the virus through the simian cell line on maintenance medium in the presence of serum and under appropriate passaging conditions. The vaccine includes a carrier agent, such as sucrose gelatin stabilizer, which is mixed with a live modified virus that is produced as described above. The vaccine is preferably used to prevent PRRS by immunizing swine via the local (upper mucosal) route or parenteral route of vaccination. The immunized swine typically remain free of disease symptoms subsequent to being challenged with the wild-type virus. The vaccine may be produced in commercial quantities by a process including the steps of preparing expansion cultures of a simian cell line; preparing production cultures by infecting the expansion cultures with an attenuated virus; harvesting the production cultures; stabilizing and lyophilizing the virus.",

    "abstract": "This invention generally relates to a device and kit for mixing and instillation of a two-part chemical system within a body cavity, under pressure. More particularly, the invention relates to a vaginal hygiene system, particularly to a two-part chemical system effective for achieving stasis of the vaginal flora, whereby bacterial vaginosis is effectively mitigated, thereby eliminating undesirable vaginal discharge and discomfort. The invention most particularly relates to a kit including a highly portable dispenser having separate and distinct reservoirs which segregate the two-part chemical system until the desired time of use, and further including a combination applicator nozzle and blending manifold, wherein activation of the device results in the fluidic coupling of the chemical reservoirs, and provides immediate intermixing of the two-part chemical system concomitant with pressurized expulsion through an imperforate nozzle into the vaginal canal. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The vagina is a dynamic ecosystem that normally contains approximately 10 9  bacterial colony-forming units per gram of vaginal fluid. The normal vaginal fluid is clear to white, odorless, and of high viscosity. Normal bacterial flora is dominated by  lactobacilli , however, a variety of other organisms, including some potential pathogens, are also present at lower concentrations. Normally, the action of  Lactobacilli  converts glycogen to lactic acid, whereby the lactic acid provides a physiologic lowering of pH. The normal vagina of a woman of reproductive age has a pH of 3.8 to 4.2. This lower pH provides a protection by making the vaginal environment less hospitable to certain pathogens, specifically certain yeast and other bacteria. Some  lactobacilli  also produce hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), which has microbicidal properties that can kill bacteria and viruses. When the normal balance of microorganisms is disrupted, bacterial vaginosis can occur, leading to vaginal discomfort ranging from itching to a burning sensation along with vaginal discharge. Vaginal discharge is one of the most common conditions for which women seek medical care. Approximately 10 million office visits each year are attributed to vaginal discharge complaints. The present inventors have discovered that a two-part chemical system, preferably formed from acetic acid and hydrogen peroxide, can aid in achieving stasis of the vaginal flora, returning the vaginal canal to its normal pH and mitigating the effects of bacterial vaginosis. One problem with this treatment is that the chemicals must be admixed just prior to their application to the vaginal canal in order to maintain maximum effectiveness. Although it would be ideal to instill such a solution as desired, having to carry around the individual components of the chemical system in separate portions, mixing them and then inserting the blended components into the vaginal canal is cumbersome and inconvenient. Therefore, such treatments have generally been instilled in the home or at a doctor&#39;s office. If a portable device could be provided which enabled easy transport of such a chemical system, and further provided for ease of intermixing and subsequent insertion into the vaginal canal, a long felt need would be realized. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART U.S. Pat. No. 7,959,597, entitled “Irrigation And Aspiration Device And Method” to Baker et al., discloses an irrigation and aspiration system. The system can be configured to aspirate and irrigate alone, sequentially or concurrently. The system can be configured to aspirate and irrigate the nasal cavity. The system can be manually controlled. The system can have removable and easily cleanable reservoirs for aspirant and irrigant. U.S. Pat. No. 7,789,854, entitled “Medical Treatment Kit And Methods Of Use Thereof” to Talamonti, discloses a medical treatment kit and methods of use thereof. The kit includes a container, two or more chambers within the container, an antiseptic agent disposed in one of the chambers, a cleansing agent disposed in a separate chamber and an applicator.

    "abstract": "A further disadvantage involved in using the usual folding chairs for non-passive activities in that the seating surface itself is usually hard and, therefore, produces soreness during any prolonged use. It would, therefore, be advantageous to provide a portable device which could be applied to a conventional folding chair in order to change its pitch from negative to positive. It would be even more advantageous to provide such a device which would, at the same time, eliminate the problem associated with the hardness of conventional seating surfaces. Finally, recognizing that the user of such a portable device would normally be doing so in connection with some activity such as playing a musical instrument in a band, it would be helpful to provide storage capacity in the device to carry his music folders, record albums or other equipment involved in the activities, as well as such additional items as wallets, key cases and the like which would otherwise cause bulges in his pants pockets and a certain amount of discomfort while the user is sitting. The present invention provides all of these advantages in a clever, compact, durable and relatively inexpensive device which can be carried in the manner of a valise and simply placed on a standard folding chair. SHORT STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION The invention has two principal parts, namely, a carrying case and a springy plate inserted therein. The springy plate is elevated at its rear with a shim giving it the overall configuration of an inclined plane. The carrying case is made of a flexible material. When the invention is placed upon a standard folding chair with the elevated portion of the plate to the rear, a positive pitch is produced. The carrying case is further provided with a resilient cushion which, in cooperation with the springy plate produces a relatively soft comfortable seating surface and one which flexes with the movement of the user as he pursues his activity. A supplemental shim is included in order to provide a means for adjusting the amount of change in pitch to be produced by the invention. Finally, the inclined plane member is removable and, in conjunction with the supplemental shim, it may be used as a music stand.",

The rollers have a moisture absorbing material on their outer surface, and the herbicide is dripped onto this moisture engaging surface. The rollers are transported through the field at a level above the tops of the crop being cultivated, and the rollers engage the weeds which protrude up above the top of the crop being cultivated. This method has been found effective for example for the removal of volunteer corn from a field of soybeans. The corn plants protrude upwardly above the soybeans, and are engaged by the roller without exposing the soybean plants to herbicide.

    "abstract": "This invention relates generally to an electrical signal management system. More specifically, the present invention relates to an integrated system for electrical signal switching and amplifying. Also, the present invention relates to an automatic calibration system for calibrating the electrical signal switching and amplifying hardware in the integrated system. Electrophysiology signal amplification systems commonly include a switch box generally located at a patient&#39;s bedside during an electrophysiology procedure. The switch box receives the proximal ends of intracardiac catheter leads, ECG leads, blood pressure sensor leads, breathing sensor leads, temperature sensor leads, pulse sensor leads, or the like. The leads are input by attaching them to input terminals which are arranged on the switch box in a grid-type fashion and labelled for identification either numerically or by color. The switch box outputs to an amplifier which in turn outputs to a computer processing unit, which also in turn may output to a monitor or chart recorder if desired. During setup of the switch box, the computer processing unit must receive information identifying the input locations of each of the leads in the input terminal grid. This is commonly accomplished by having one operator at the patient&#39;s bedside attach the leads in one-by-one fashion into the switch box, and then announce to a second operator the identification of each input terminal label corresponding to the particular lead being inserted. The second operator then simultaneously inputs into the computer processing unit the label indicating the particular parameter being monitored and the corresponding output terminal identification number or color as it announced by the first operator. After the leads have been attached to the switch box and the computer processing unit has received the necessary labels related to the positioning of the leads and the related input terminal numbers or colors to which the leads correspond, the procedure is commenced. However, very often during an electrophysiology procedure, it is desirable to either move a catheter to a different position in the patient&#39;s heart, to add a catheter, or to compare signals received from various catheters. In any of these events, it is necessary to re-identify the particular label given to the catheter lead so that the changes or additions may be properly input into the computer processing unit. Because of the physical separation of the switch box and the computer processing unit, and the necessity of having two operators perform redundant operations to ensure that the computer processing unit correctly correlates the label of the catheter lead with its position in the switch box, necessary changes during a procedure can cause errors in the analysis data to occur, as well as potential injury to the patient. Attempts have been made to solve the problem of input terminal/lead label correspondence during setup and operational use of signal acquisition and processing systems such as the electrical signal management system of the present invention, with varying success. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,037,586 to Grichnick, describes an electroencephalograph which includes a visual display panel which is actuated in response to digital signals for indicating the particular pattern in which electrodes connected to the patient are processed to provided desired output signals. Although this invention may help an operator view the particular processing order of signals received by the device, it nevertheless fails to assist the physician in setup of the device for operation or in changing the setup during a procedure. U.S. Pat. No. 4,695,955 issued to Faisandier, describes a prior art electronic device which acquires and processes signals originating from sensors attached to a patient. The device automatically recognizes a sensor lead attached to an input terminal thereof due to the mechanical design of the lead itself, and automatically programs the processing system thereof for the proper signal amplification, energization, and processing elements. This device simplifies setup of a procedure by automatically recognizing the particular lead attached to the input terminal. It nevertheless contains the drawback of requiring the use of leads which can be mechanically identified by the device to initiate automatic programming of the processing system. Further, the device fails to allow relabelling of a lead depending on a change in the corresponding sensors position on the patient, and/or a change in the particular parameter being monitored by the sensor. OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide an electrical signal management system which considerably simplifies preprocedure calibration and setup, and also simplifies setup changes during an ongoing signal acquisition and processing procedure. Another object of the present invention is to provide an integrated system for electrical signal switching and amplifying which is sufficiently small to be mounted at a patient&#39;s bedside. A further object of the present invention is to provide an integrated electrical signal switching and amplifying system which can be completely and independently setup and controlled by an operator at the patient&#39;s bedside without the necessity of a second operator recording input terminal identification numbers or colors to an attached computer processing unit as a manner of identifying the output terminal positions of sensor leads. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an integrated electrical signal switching and amplification system which can function totally independently of any data processing device which may be attached thereto. It is also an object of the present invention to provide an integrated electrical signal switching and amplifying system which provides analog output therefrom for allowing attachment of an analog monitor, chart recorder, and/or computer processing unit, such that monitoring and/or recording of signals output from the integrated electrical signal switching and amplifying system can be accomplished by a prior art analog monitor and/or chart recorder even in the absence of a computer processing unit or during periods of malfunction or breakdown of the computer processing unit. It is another object of the present invention to provide an interactive display screen and software for simplifying setup and operation of the integrated electrical signal switching and amplifying system. It is also an object of the present invention to provide the integrated electrical signal switching and amplifying system having an onboard microprocessing capability which allows total functioning thereof independently from any outside computer processing unit and allows storage of predetermined setup configurations for simplification of the setup procedure. It is further an object of the present invention to provide the integrated electrical signal switching and amplifying system with an electrical hardware design which significantly reduces the overall size of the system to allow it to be mounted at a patient&#39;s bedside to facilitate an operator&#39;s use thereof during an electrophysiology procedure. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an automatic calibration system for calibrating. These and other objects of the present invention are realized in a presently preferred embodiment thereof, disclosed by way of example and not by way of limitation, which includes an integrated electrical signal switching and amplifying system for use in electrophysiology procedures as an interface between electrical signals received from a patient through sensors such as intracardiac catheters, ECG leads, pressure sensors or the like, and an analog monitor, chart recorder, or computer processing unit. The system uses digital technology to amplify and condition electrical signals from a patient&#39;s heart and download analog formatted signals to a computer processing unit or a traditional analog monitor or chart recorder. The analog output of the system of the present invention has a unique safety advantage over prior art electrophysiology amplification systems in that it ensures the possibility of uninterrupted electrophysiology studies in the event that a computer processing unit fails during the electrophysiology procedure. For example, a chart recorder could be used alone with the present invention, or in conjunction with a computer processing unit, to record the electrophysiology procedure. This feature allows the system of the present invention to be used to present information from an electrophysiology procedure entirely independently of a computer processing unit if desired.",

An optical device is provided that measures the modulations to the wavefront of an image that passes through an intraocular lens “IOL.” An IOL vision emulator is provided comprised of an exam chair, a wavefront generator with a plurality of independent channels, and a focusing system. In the wavefront generator, a projector, preferentially a digital display, projects a real image through optical elements that are under control of a computer. A focusing system, preferentially a spherical field mirror, focuses the wavefront generator to a position that is optically conjugate to the patient&#39;s eye. The focusing system may provide a near-viewing display accessory that can be placed at variable distances from the patient for near and intermediate viewing conditions and an eye tracker to stabilize the positions of the projected images. The refractive error of the visual system of the eye being tested is nulled by the wavefront generator and the wavefront generator is then adjusted to produce an image on the patient&#39;s retina that emulates the image that would result if the IOL was implanted in the patient&#39;s eye following cataract extraction. The disclosure teaches the ability to test the tolerance of prospective implant patients to different IOL designs over a range of different distances and viewing conditions under monocular or binocular conditions.

    "abstract": "The field of the invention is that of article carriers supported by an animate bearer, such as a human being. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Human beings have long carried articles by attaching them to belts worn around the waist or hips. Such objects have included canteens, weapons, food carriers, and the like. In modern times, for example, photographers may carry cameras, lens systems such as telephoto lens systems, and other photographic gear in pouches or carriers suspended from a belt worn about the waist or hips. An article to be carried by a belt may be permanently or releaseably attached to a definite position on the belt. Alternatively, the article may be attached to the belt by a sleeve or the like so that the article may be moved along the belt as needed in order to access the article or to wear it in the most comfortable position. A belt carrier system that provides for both types of attachment at the choice of the wearer is needed. U.S. Pat. No. 5,881,933 to Rogers, entitled “Track Member System” discloses a system for carrying containers suspended from a track member which may be attached to a body encircling belt or attached to clothing which includes a pair of protruding tracks substantially parallel and from which the containers for holding articles are suspended by clips on the containers which are attachable to the tracks anywhere along the lengths thereof or positionable lengthwise on the tracks by sliding thereon at tapered ends of the tracks. This system includes a clamp in the form of a planar wedge for locking the container in place on the tracks to prevent the container from sliding along the tracks to an undesired position and inhibiting forceful unintended removal of the clip and container from the tracks without removal of the clamp. The track member system of Rogers is complicated and expensive to make because its construction requires the provision of two parallel and protruding members and a rigid clip attached to a carrier that is specifically shaped to receive the parallel members and thereby hold the carrier on the belt. The security of the attachment of the clip to the carrier depends on how well the clip encloses the members so that failure of that enclosure will cause detachment of the carrier from the belt. In addition, the planar wedge clamp is complicated and requires the provision of additional components. What is needed is an improved carrier system that provides for attaching articles to a belt that provides for the articles to be releaseably attached at a fixed position on the belt or, in the alternative, to be in a slideable relation to the belt. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention is a system comprising an elongated planar member or belt to be worn by an animate bearer such as a human being having an outside surface facing away from the bearer&#39;s body and an inside surface facing toward the body of the bearer, at least one loop or pocket attached to the outside surface of the belt, and at least one carrier for an object comprising a sleeve having a first end attached to a body of the carrier and a second end detachably attached to the body of the carrier, the first end and the second end of the sleeve being spaced apart at their respective places of attachment to the body of the carrier so that the second end of the sleeve can be folded over the belt and attached to the body of the carrier, and further comprising a tab of stiff material having a first end attached to the carrier at or near the junction of the first end of the sleeve to the carrier and a second end remaining unattached, the tab having an axis generally aligned with the sleeve, the second of the tab being capable of being inserted through one of the loops of the belt when the sleeve is folded over the belt for attachment of the carrier to the belt and thereby fixing the carrier with respect to the belt so that the carrier substantially may not be slid along the belt whereas if the tab is not inserted into a loop when the sleeve is folded over the belt the carrier is not substantially fixed with respect to the belt and therefore may be slid along the belt. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION It is an object and advantage of the present invention to provide to provide an improved system for carrying equipment on the wearer. Another object and advantage is to provide a system for carrying equipment on the wearer that will positively attach the equipment to a member supported by the wearer so that the equipment will not become accidentally detached. Another object and advantage is to provide a system that will positively attach equipment to the wearer that will permit the equipment to be moved with respect to the member worn by the wearer while the equipment is supported by that member but alternatively, at the option of the wearer, to permit the equipment to be carried in a fixed relationship to the member.

    "abstract": "The present invention provides a composition that ensures selective release of an active ingredient at a given site, and in particular a pharmaceutical composition enabling selective release of an active ingredient to be obtained at a target organ. The present invention more particularly relates to a pharmaceutical composition intended for oral administration, providing selective release of its active ingredient in the colon. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Numerous pharmaceutical compositions have been developed with an aim to providing controlled release of the active ingredient. The majority of these compositions are based on the principle of delayed release or sustained release of the medicament at, or not at, a target organ. EP-A-0,250,374 discloses coated mini-dosing units. Their core is obtained by compressing a mixture of the active ingredient with polymers that swell in water by osmosis action, the polymeric coating that surrounds the core controlling release of the medicament. EP-A-0,077,956 discloses enteric micro-capsules containing an active compound as a core material, surrounded by a coating essentially consisting of ethyl cellulose and an enteric polymer material, a water-swellable polymer material being optionally incorporated into the core. GB-A-2,202,143 discloses a pharmaceutical composition comprising a water-insoluble drug dispersed in a matrix consisting of microcrystalline cellulose and at least one cellulose derivative. Such a composition leads to sustained release of the active compound over a period of at least 8 hours. These compositions can be coated with an enteric coating so as to ensure release of the medicament in the intestinal tract rather than in the stomach. The dosing units described in these documents do not make it possible to obtain immediate release of the active ingredient at a precise organ; speed of release is limited by the speed of diffusion through the matrix surrounding or trapping it, the result of this possibly being that all the administered dose is not released at the target organ. Effectively, considering the gastro-intestinal tract, transit time varies from one individual to another over a wide range, and the conditions prevailing in the gastro-intestinal system, notably as regards pH, also vary over wide degrees. Research carried out with a view to obtaining a composition providing selective release of active ingredients at a target organ (for example the colon) were up until now centered around either the use of tablets for oral administration, coated with polymers that become decomposed by the bacteria present in the colon, or the use of tablets for oral administration, that were coated with an enteric coating. In the first type of approach, the pro-drug concept is used, in other words a precursor of the active ingredient, the active ingredient being bound to, for example, a glucoside type polymer (Friend, Phillips et Torzen, F. Controlled Rel., 15, 47-54, (1991)). The main problem with this approach is that the medicament itself is chemically modified, and release of the active ingredient is conditioned by in-situ bacterial hydrolysis. In the second type of approach, coatings are used consisting of polymers the solubility of which depends on pH, and which dissolve at a pH above that of the stomach. The products are unable to dissolve until the pH value of the ambient medium is above a certain value. The use of tablets having this type of coating does not lead to satisfactory results and does not make it possible to obtain targeted release of active ingredients. In effect, if the pH profile of the gastro-intestinal tract is studied, it is noted that the pH in the distal part of the intestine varies between 6.8 and 7.2, and then falls to a value of 4.5 to 6 in the ascending colon. Consequently, the pharmaceutical composition is designed whereby the polymer coating dissolves at a pH which is greater than or equal to 7; the polymer dissolves in the intestine and the active ingredient is released at this level. However, pH varies to a large degree from one individual to another. Thus, if the pH stays at fairly low levels, the enteric coating will remain intact and the active ingredient will not be released. It thus clearly appears that controlled release of active ingredient that is based solely on the use of a coating that selectively breaks down at a target organ, or before reaching it, does not ensure targeted release of the medicament at that organ. WO-A-92 17165 discloses compositions containing a core, a layer of adjuvants comprising a water-soluble material and a water-insoluble material, and an enteric coating. The core contains the active ingredient in association with a swelling agent. EP-A-0 210 540 discloses compositions comprising an inert core, a layer containing the active ingredient, a layer made of a swelling agent and an enteric coating, or an inert core, a layer containing the active ingredient with a swelling agent and an enteric coating. These two cited documents do not allow a selective release of the active ingredient at a target organ, and furthermore involves contamination of the active ingredient with the swelling agent. There is thus a need for a composition providing selective release of an active ingredient at a given site, and in particular for a pharmaceutical composition providing selective release of an active ingredient at a target organ. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention sets out to overcome the disadvantages of existing pharmaceutical compositions, in other words non-selective and prolonged release, and of providing a composition ensuring selective release of an active ingredient at a given site, and notably a pharmaceutical composition providing selective release of the active ingredient at a target organ, in particular the colon. The present invention consequently provides a composition comprising, successively:",

Designing the endoprosthesis in such a way that the core element exhibits on a portion of its surface an impressed relief that corresponds to the structure of the inner surface of the endoprosthesis guarantees, on the one hand, that the forces exerted to move the core element in relation to the outer body can be kept to a minimum and, on the other hand, that a sure radial separation of the self-expanding endoprosthesis from the core element is still ensured even after a long storage period. Thus sure and reliable operation is achieved by means of such a design. This type of endoprosthesis can also be manufactured easily and inexpensively. A preferred type model of the invention provides for the relief impressed on the core element to be individually adapted to the structure of the inner surface of the endoprosthesis. Such a design ensures that an optimal form-locking connection is achieved between the core element and the endoprosthesis and therefore guarantees the greatest possible operational reliability. In this case, the individual form-locking meshing sites are individually matched to one another with respect to their position, arrangement, and design. A preferred process provides for using the individual endoprosthesis that is to be inserted in the device to form the relief. An advantage of this process is that great tolerances with respect to accuracy to gauge of the endoprosthesis do not themselves adversely affect the operational reliability of the device.",

    "abstract": "The invention relates to an irrigation valve device comprising a valve and a swellable member which controls the valve in response to its moisture content and is subjected to the water passing through the valve. 2. Description of the Prior Art A known irrigation valve of this kind comprises a swellable member consisting of wood chips which are accommodated in an apertured cylinder and act on a magnetic valve. The magnetic valve is included in an irrigation conduit which feeds a lawn sprinkler. The latter is arranged so that the water sprayed from it reaches the horizontally disposed apertured cylinder and, through the apertures in the cylinder, the swellable member. When sufficient water has been absorbed, the swellable member closes the magnetic valve. For the purpose of regulating the flow of water to the swellable member, the periphery of the apertured cylinder has apertures which differ in number and diameter. By turning the apertured cylinder, a different total cross-sectional area is offered to the sprayed water so that the latter will contain more or less water at a given spraying intensity. One disadvantage of this irrigation valve resides in the fact that the apertured cylinder to a very large extent covers the swellable member from the outside and consequently the surrounding air does not have adequate access to the swellable member for the purpose of drying the same. As a result, there is a very long drying period during which no spraying can take place. In addition, the magnetic valve is either open or closed and thus in the open position of the magnetic valve an excessive supply of water must be offered to the plants so that the latter can withstand the period during which the magnetic valve is switched off. However, artificial irrigation is more rational and more effective if the water can be supplied with more continuity. German Gebrauchsmuster No. 77 06 643 describes another irrigation valve device that works with a swellable member of wood which is accommodated in an apertured cylinder, has one end acting on a diaphragm valve and its other end supported against a screw-threaded plug. By screwing the plug into the apertured cylinder to a greater or lesser extent one can adjust the response threshold of this known hygrostat. Since this irrigation valve device is intended to be buried in the earth, adjustment of the response threshold of the valve by turning the plug is very cumbersome to start with because, since the plug is located at the lower end of the valve, it must be dug out of the earth completely. Further, adjustment of the play for the swellable member is basically inadequate to achieve optimum artificial irrigation because only the length of swelling is set at which the valve will close or open but one cannot, for example, vary the frequency of operation. Apart from the poor accessability of the plug for setting the response threshold, the installation of the hygrostat in the earth has the additional disadvantage that the swellable member cannot be dried out by the outside air. However, the dissipation of moisture by the wood to the earth is too slow for the irrigation of plants because, in contrast with a plant, the swellable member does not withdraw water from the earth and hence the earth in the vicinity of the wooden member remains moist for a longer period than in the region of a plant using up water. These long inoperative periods have to be compensated by correspondingly intensive irrigation of the plants during the operative periods of the valve, which is contrary to the aim of achieving a water supply that is as continuous as possible. DE-AS No. 1 191 163 describes an apparatus in which the swelling of a swellable member in the form of a wooden rod pinches a water hose and thereby inhibits the supply of water to a plant container, the swellable member being subjected to liquid from the earth by way of a sponge in the base of the plant container. In this apparatus there is likewise a set screw for the play of the swellable member, with which one can merely set the degree of swelling of the swellable member at which the hose will be pinched shut. DE-AS No. 1 039 296 describes an automatic irrigating apparatus for cultivated plants, in which a hygrometer at the end of a tube insertable in the earth controls a liquid valve disposed at the other end of the tube. The humidity threshold at which the valve is to be actuated can for example be regulated by a set screw. Again, this irrigating apparatus has inherent disadvantages resulting from the accommodation of the hygrometer in the earth. A humidity-controlled valve of quite a different kind is disclosed in DE-OS No. 2 513 600. This known valve adapts the irrigation to atmospheric conditions, i.e. the valve remains closed during rain or very humid conditions and opens for a predetermined adjustable time interval when it is dry. The irrigating water passing through the valve is not returned to the swellable member. A control device described in DE-OS No. 23 25 980 comprises a valve member in which the interior accommodates a swellable member acting on the valve seat and which has lateral apertures and a top aperture for the entry of water for swelling purposes. The valve member is placed on or in the earth. There is no provision for setting a particular control behavior of the device. Finally, U.S. Pat. No. 3,512,712 describes an automatic irrigating apparatus that operates with a humidity sensor which is connected by way of a wick to the part of the earth to be watered and is otherwise subjected to the humidity of the air. The humidity film comprises a swellable member in the form of hollow cylindrical blocks of which the swelling is transmitted to an indicating apparatus and to an irrigating valve. The supply of water for swelling purposes from the earth to the swellable member cannot be controlled. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention has the object of providing an irrigation valve device of the aforementioned kind that is adjustable to an optimum. This object is achieved according to the invention in that the irrigation valve device is constructed to be insertable in the earth so that the swellable member or a water-permeable receptacle therefor makes contact with the earth over an adjustable distance to control the supply of swelling water to the swellable member. By means of the construction of the irrigation valve device according to the invention, the swellable member or the receptacle therefor is sub-divided into an upper and a lower section, the lower section being wetted by the swelling water which reaches the valve device through the earth and the upper section, which is subjected to weather influences, is moistened as a result of capillary action. This achieves excellent adjustability of the irrigation. In so far that the size of the wetted lower section of the swellable member or the receptacle therefor and the unwetted upper section are varied, a change is produced in the time taken to achieve a predetermined degree of swelling. The time becomes all the longer, the less deeply the swellable member or the receptacle penetrates into the earth and it is shortened by deeper insertion of the swellable member or receptacle into the earth. In this way one can set the irrigation to be very close to ideal conditions. If, in accordance with an advantageous development of the invention, wood is used for the swellable member, one exploits the fact that the swelling of wood is considerably faster with direct wetting of watering than it is when moisture is absorbed under capillary action. The time taken until a degree of swelling is achieved at which the valve closes is practically the sum of the change in length periods of the lower section of the swellable member that is wetted directly and the upper section that is moistened by capillary action. Another possibility of influencing the swelling time, namely that proportion of the time accounted for by the capillary moistening of the wooden swellable member, is by arranging the wooden swellable member at an angle to the vertical. It has been found that swelling of an elongate wooden swellable member is all the more rapid when receiving water under capillary action the more the elongate member is inclined from the vertical. In addition, the swellable length that can be wetted by receiving water under capillary action in the first place becomes all the longer, the more the wooden swellable member is inclined from the vertical. According to one particular construction of the invention, the swellable member is of swellable plastics material, particularly polyurethane gel. Polyurethane gel has an extraordinarily large swellability so that even very small swellable members can bring about large valve-actuating distances and forces. Desirably, the swellable member of swellable plastics material is accommodated in a perforated sleeve serving as the valve member and acts on a pinchable hose which is passed through the sleeve. By inserting the sleeve in the earth to a greater or smaller extent, one then obtains an effect of adjustment that is similar to that with a wooden swellable member. Since the swelling times up to closure of the valve and shrinkage periods up to opening thereof are all the shorter as the swellable member is smaller and product short swelling and shrinkage periods so that the plants to be irrigated are supplied with water in a multitude of small quantities, the invention also suggests an irrigation valve device comprising a very small swellable member of swellable plastics material. More particularly, an elongate member of porous material, particularly ceramic, serving as the receptacle has in its upper end face a recess in which the swellable member of swellable plastic material, especially polyurethane gel, is accomodated and this, in turn, has its upper face abutting an elastic sealing element of the valve that is seated on the top of the receptacle. This sealing element of the valve acts as a valve actuating element and, upon swelling of the swellable member, is pushed upwardly in the direction of closing the valve. The swellable member is thus enclosed by the receptable and the sealing element so that water for swelling purposes can reach the swellable member solely by way of the porous material of the receptacle. The direct supply of water to the swellable member as is possible in the case of a swellable member accommodated in a perforated sleeve is thus suppressed. By inserting the receptacle in the earth to a larger or smaller extent, its proportion of length directly subjected to the moisture of the earth is varied, whereby one can also control the supply of swelling water to the swellable body as a result of capillary action in the porous receptacle. The swellable member thus swells only as a result of water conveyed under capillary action. The section of the receptacle projecting from the earth is subjected to weather influences, i.e. the effects of the sun and wind, and extracts the moisture that was absorbed by the swellable member. The swellable member can be comparatively small because it need not extend to the part of the receptacle that is seated in the earth, thereby resulting in desirably short swelling and shrinkage periods.",

The nozzle is designed so that the bore has four different sections. These sections cause the air stream to contract and expand which affects the velocity and temperature of the air stream. These sections include an elliptically converging section, a diverging expansion section, diverging compression section, and a parallel flow section.

    "abstract": "The invention concerns a spring system for the upper feeder rollers in forage harvesters; in particular in a feeder device for a self-propelled forage harvester. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Spring systems are encountered in feeder systems for forage harvesters, which in the predominant number today are equipped with two lower feeder rollers carried in bearing point fixed in the feeder casing and two upper feeder rollers working together with these. The upper feeder rollers designated in the following as prepressing rollers, are carried in bearing points in the feeder casing so that their height can be altered, in order to be able to move upwards on the drawing in of harvested crop. In doing so the spring system has the task of applying a defined roll force to the prepressing rollers and to the pressing rollers, so that in conjunction with the lower feeder rollers they can on the one hand compress the crop on being drawn in and on the other hand with the aid of this roll force make possible at all the drawing-in of the crop and its transport to the cylinder chopper. Because of the increase in performance of forage harvesters required in recent years, ever higher demands are made upon their feeder equipment, which has led on the one hand to ever wider feeder devices and higher lift heights of the prepressing roller and of the pressing roller and to a further increase in the feeding speed of the crop. These higher demands can then be fulfilled only if through the spring system the roll forces exerted by the prepressing roller and the pressing roller on the crop are at least so great that the crop cannot be pulled in from the chopper cylinder. But on the other hand they must not be so great that not just any greater accumulation of crop leads to blockages in the feeder device. The roll forces must increase significantly with growing layer thickness of the crop as a result of friction of the crop on the sidewalls of the feeder device. In the region of smaller layer thickness on the other hand, they must be kept small so that particularly in the case of the maize harvest the grains are not knocked out of the cob by too high roll forces which in the case of large chopped lengths has a particularly negative effect. Finally it is still to be pointed out that the roll forces are applied not only by the spring system, but also by the forces of reaction from the driving moment of the prepressing rollers and the pressing rollers, upon which the roller weights and frictional forces are dependent when raising and lowering them. The greater proportion comes, however, from the spring system, followed by the forces of reaction. The remaining quantities are practically negligible. For the fulfilment of these requirements already multitudes of spring systems have become known. One of them is to be seen in the Prospectus of the German firm CLAAS for the forage harvester series “Jaguar 880 to 820” with the note “11/20 (Rihn) German 70/CVG 1106.1”. Here on the shafts of the prepressing roller and of the pressing roller, on the right side viewed in the direction of travel of the forage harvester, a gearbox is placed, which is equipped at the front with a console, on which two tension springs placed inside each other engage. Their point of suspension lies plainly in front of the shaft of the prepressing roller. A single further tension spring engages from below on the gearbox about in the centre between the prepressing roller and the pressing roller. On the other hand the arrangement of the tension springs is similar, only for reasons of space they are located somewhat further up, and instead of engaging with the gearbox the tension springs engage with the oscillating crank between the prepressing roller and the pressing roller. For damping unwanted oscillations two shock absorbers are fixed on both sides of the spring system. A disadvantage with this system is that the differences in the roll forces for a thin and a thick layer of crop are not great enough, so that either with a roll force which is set too small the crop is conveyed ever worse with increasing thickness of the layer, or in the converse case the grains are knocked out of the cobs already before the chopper cylinder. Through the described position of the attachment points of the tension springs, on the one hand it is to be criticised that with every movement of the prepressing roller the magnitude of the roll force of the pressing roller changes and the converse, because of which both roll forces are undefined. On the other hand this attachment leads to an oscillating motion of the prepressing roller and the pressing roller about the point of attachment of the tension springs, so that the aforementioned shock absorber would be necessary, which represents a cost-increasing factor. Finally with these spring systems there is yet another disadvantage, that the tension springs and the lower stops of the prepressing roller and the pressing roller lie in a zone very much endangered by dirt, so that the tension springs can no longer return to their initial lengths and on the lower stops an interfering quantity of crop collects. The consequence of this is a restricted output of the crop with a small layer thickness. A second variant embodiment for a spring system on a feeder device for forage harvesters was made known with EP 0 797 914 B1 and as an amplification of this in the prospectus belonging to this forage harvester with the note “62027/D00—Printed in Italy—12/96”, in which likewise as with CLAAS on the shafts of the prepressing roller and the pressing roller a gearbox is put on. Almost centrally on the gearbox or on the oscillating crank between the prepressing roller and the pressing roller on the left side there is a pivot point, to which is attached an upwards projecting connecting rod, the upper end of which is likewise joined articulated with a swivelling lever, the other end of which ends in a bearing point attached to the casing of the feeder device. In a forwards projecting connecting bracket on the connecting rod a tension spring is suspended by its upper end and is fixed with its lower end to the front on the easing of the feeder device. As this spring system exhibits the same disadvantages as afore-described one, to avoid repetition reference will be made at this point only to this one. A third possibility for the design of a spring system for the upper feeder rollers is expounded in EP 1 151 658 A1. The only difference from the two previously described ones consists in that instead of two upper feeder rollers three are employed here. As the coupling of the two tension springs on each side is in principle executed the same as for the two previously described spring systems; the same disadvantages apply here too. In the prospectus of the German firm MENGELE with the note “WA FITZEK/1/94—10” a self-propelled forage harvester of the type “MAMMUT” with a feeder device and spring system for the upper feeder rollers is depicted. Here the roll force acting on the prepressing roller is produced by two tension springs, and that for the pressing roller is produced by a tension spring one on each side. Although here the directions of pull of the tension springs in the lowest position of the prepressing roller and of the pressing roller appear at first glance to be somewhat more favourable than in the three previously described spring systems, it is nevertheless to be criticised, that with the differently large excursions the position of the tension is so far removed from the shafts of the rollers, that every movement of the prepressing roller changes the magnitude of the roll force of the pressing roller and vice versa. In the same way the disadvantage remains of the too small difference in the roll forces for a thin and a thick layer of crop. Also the soiling of the tension springs and of the lower stops is unavoidable here, so that also the disadvantages associated with this exist. Finally, reference would be made to the feeder device with upper feeder rollers and a spring system in accordance with DE-OS 26 09 272, in which the prepressing roller and the pressing roller are carried in bearing points in an approximately vertical orientation in the side walls so that they can be moved independently of each other. Each of the upper feeder rollers obtains its drive separately via a cardan shaft. The roll force is produced here by compression springs, which are abut with their upper ends on the casing of the feeder casing and which press with their lower ends on the bearing of the prepressing roller or the pressing roller. For adjusting the roll force the upper ends are held in threaded couplings, which are vertically adjustable by means of threaded spindles. Although through the separate drives the reaction forces resulting from them are practically excluded, this solution too has still some disadvantages attached to it. These are that also here there are too small differences in the roll forces with differing thicknesses of the layer of harvested crop and the position of the lower stops for the prepressing roller and the pressing roller in the area of greatest soiling with dirt. Furthermore, with the increasing of the roll force the upper stop is displaced downwards, so that the maximum height of lift thereby experiences a restriction. Besides, through the possibility of movements of both rollers completely independently of each other blockages can occur in the event that the prepressing roller is raised up to the upper stop and the pressing roller remains below. Therefore the task of the invention is to create a spring system for the upper feeder roller of a forage harvester, in which the roll forces increase distinctly with growing thickness of the layer of the harvested crop, where the springs envisaged for the prepressing roller load only this roller over the whole lifting path and not the pressing roller and vice versa, the springs of which are situated in a space less burdened with dirt and in which the upper and the lower stops of the rollers are so formed and arranged, that the prepressing roller and the pressing roller actually come again always into this same position regardless of deposits of dirt. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION For the present feeder device with two upper feeder rollers the front prepressing roller and the pressing roller arranged behind it are attached opposite two lower feeder rollers carried in bearing points at a fixed location in the casing of the feeder device so that their distance can be varied, as a result of which they can swing between their lowest and uppermost position according to the supply of crop. So that on the one hand they can pre-compress the crop well in combination with the lower feeder roller and on the other hand be able to transport it to the chopping device, they have the necessary roll force applied to them by means of the compression springs with their upper ends abutting with the casing of the feeder device and with their lower ends supported on the bearing point points of the upper feeder rollers. The compression springs are held in position with guide rods, onto which they are placed concentrically and their upper ends are attached to the casing of the feeder device so that they can move freely. For the prepressing roller two compression springs are employed, one of which exerts a small roll force on it already in the lowest position of the prepressing roller. The second compression spring remains without effect over the first stretch of its lifting path from the lowest position and engages only later with its upper end on the casing of the feeder device, as a result of which then its roll forces add up to a very great roll force. Through this high roll force it is possible without any problems, to exclude the forces of reaction arising from the drive moments of the upper roller on the prepressing roller, which with an appropriate management of the drive relieve the prepressing roller, without negative influences on the precompresssion and transport at the this point. The roll force for the prepressing roller is produced by a compression spring, which already in its lowest position is under a slight prestress and which over the entire lifting path of the pressing roller exerts a distinctly lower roll force on it than do the two compression springs on the prepressing roller. Consequently, with the same drive management as described above the forces of reaction arising from the driving moments for the upper roller bear down on the pressing roller from above and press it onto the crop, so that it is even possible to dispense with these compression springs altogether. As a precaution, all the spring systems for the prepressing roller lie within the wishes of protection of the invention, which exhibit a progressively rising spring characteristic and differ in detail from the previously described solution. Also specially formed single compression springs or systems with more than two springs fall under this protection. In this spring system, the area of small layer thicknesses exerts only small roll forces on the crop and with growing layer thickness the roll forces increase distinctly. The direction of the roll forces on the bearing points as close and possible to the central axes of the shafts of the prepressing roller and of the pressing roller lead to their defined loading without mutual influencing of each other. Through the position of the compression springs and the upper and lower stops for limiting the freedom of movement of the upper feeder rollers in their uppermost and lowest position in a largely dirt free space their unchanged position over a long time is ensured.",

    "abstract": "The invention pertains to devices for controlling the accumulation of crop particles on a harvesting vehicle. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In the prior art, a few pick-ups are equipped with so-called contaminant collecting screens. They retain the majority of crop particles deposited on the screw conveyor by the feed fingers or feed paddles. However, some crop particles are still deposited on the subsequent subassemblies of the chopper, e.g., airborne grass. Another disadvantage of the crop particle collecting screens can be seen in the fact that the view of the swath is significantly impaired during pick-up. It is also very difficult to protect corn attachments from light and small crop particles. During harvest operations, crop particles are often deposited on the top of subsequent subassemblies through which the harvest is transported into the harvester or in which the harvest is processed, and accumulate at these locations. A fire may break out, for example, due to an overheated bearing or when performing a sharpening or grinding operation on the blades of the chopping drum. Consequently, the harvester needs to be cleaned frequently. Much time is lost in cleaning the machine, in particular when performing repair and maintenance procedures (e.g., during the quick-conversion of a kernel processor). It is known to mount the rear side of a flexible protective element beneath the operator&#39;s cab of a chopper, with its front side being attached to the crop gathering device. The sides of the protective element may be arranged on the sides of the chopper&#39;s main frame. In the prior art, the one-piece protective element is mounted on the crop gathering device and on the chopper by means of bands. Here, it is disadvantageous that the protective element must be removed before maintenance or repair procedures can be performed on the chopping elements or on the front side of the harvester. The problem to be solved with the present invention is that of being able to easily service a harvester equipped with a shield for preventing accumulation of crop particles on top surfaces of the harvester drive housings or the like. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, there is provided an improved shield arrangement for preventing the accumulation of crop particles on a harvesting machine. An object of the invention is to provide a crop harvester having a shield arrangement for intercepting airborne crop particles before they accumulate on the harvester, the shield arrangement permitting easy servicing of the functional elements of the harvester. A more specific object of the invention is to provide a crop harvester shield that is provided with an access element that can be opened and closed making it possible to gain access to the functional elements and/or other parts of the harvester located underneath the shield without having to first remove the entire shield. Yet another object of the invention is to provide a shield, as defined in one or more of the previous objects, wherein the shield is disposed on the harvester such that intercepted crop particles tend to gravitate off the shield so that it is in some respects self-cleaning and where cleaning may be accomplished easily by manually shaking the shield. Still another object of the invention is to provide a shield, as set forth in the foregoing objects, having an access element in the form of a flap or cover that may be pivoted, or rolled on itself, between open and closed positions.

Another disadvantage of the crop particle collecting screens can be seen in the fact that the view of the swath is significantly impaired during pick-up. It is also very difficult to protect corn attachments from light and small crop particles. \n     During harvest operations, crop particles are often deposited on the top of subsequent subassemblies through which the harvest is transported into the harvester or in which the harvest is processed, and accumulate at these locations.

    "abstract": "This invention relates to toothbrushes and, more particularly, to a toothbrush which is completely effective in simultaneously brushing the upper and lower teeth plaque free. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Research data indicates that the average person spends less than one minute brushing his or her teeth per day. On the other hand, dentists recommend that approximately three minutes of brushing three times per day is needed in order to maintain good oral hygiene. Apparently recognizing that the average person simply does not devote sufficient time in brushing his or her teeth, various designs in toothbrush construction have been developed to increase the cleaning efficiency for the individual but with limited success due to the human element involved. Recommended brushing techniques have changed over the years. The fifties had the individual brushing up and down. Late sixties and seventies advocated the Bass technique of a circular motion. The mid eighties to present are now advocating a back and forth motion (reciprocating) to sweep the bristles below the gumline and break up the plaque. This reciprocating motion definitely has proved the most effective in the battle against periodontal disease and is supported by this toothbrush&#39;s reciprocating design. It has been the endeavor to have all the qualities incorporated into this toothbrush. These qualities are a brush that is simple and easy to use, clinically effective with dramatic and immediate results, total plaque control, acceptable time expense, patient self-education, enjoyable and feels good, visual feedback, and sensory feedback from very smooth and clean teeth. However, the human elements of handicaps, laziness, lack of knowledge in what is to be accomplished, lack of dexterity, amount of time spent brushing, and knowledge of proper and complete brushing skills has eluded both the user and the toothbrush industry. This is why 3 out of 4 adults have some form of periodontal disease (some experts say it is over 90%). Brushing alone is not enough, rather the complete removal of plaque is essential in the preservation of healthy teeth, gums, and supporting bone. Plaque is a soft, sticky, colorless film of bacteria constantly forming on our teeth. It combines with sugar and other carbohydrates to form acids, which attack tooth enamel and can cause cavities. Plaque can also cause inflammation of the gums (gingivitis), which can be identified by swollen, bleeding gums. If not treated early, gingivitis can lead to periodontitis, a more serious condition that causes gums to recede and bone to deteriorate. As a result, the supporting structures are weakened and teeth become loose. It is easy to see why thorough brushing to remove plaque is essential to keep teeth, gums, and bone healthy. We all know the importance of having the individuals remove plaque on a daily basis. We also recognize the difficulties associated with motivating them to comply with a consistent and conscientious home dental care regimen. The public needs a regimen that is easy to adopt and easy to follow. U.S. Pat. No. 3,100,309 to Gambino discloses a toothbrush which has rows of curved bristles and a straight row of bristles. The rows of bristles extend transeversely of the handle and presents a rather cumbersome arrangement. U.S. Pat. No. 4,382,309, to Collis, discloses a toothbrush having two outer rows of curved bristle tufts and a single row of short, straight bristle tufts which are intended to simultaneously brush the lingual, buccal, and occlusal surfaces of the teeth. The general design in the Collis Patent probably would increase the cleaning efficiency of the toothbrush compared to the conventional toothbrush head. However, the use of a single central row of bristle tufts for brushing the occlusal surfaces and the single outer rows of bristle tufts for brushing the lingual and buccal surfaces in the Collis toothbrush is ineffective in achieving good oral hygiene, especially if the user brushes for less than one minute. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of this invention to provide a novel toothbrush which is completely effective during use to simultaneously brush the upper and lower teeth of the user plaque free. More specifically, it is an object of this invention to provide a novel toothbrush for simultaneously brushing the buccal, lingual, and occlusal surfaces of the teeth for both the upper and lower arches. Because of its unique construction, a user of this novel toothbrush can achieve the equivalence of nine minutes of manual brushing in 11/2 minutes not taking into account the speed at which the electric reciprocating brush head runs at. The average individual has the capability of generating manually between 160-200 brushing strokes per minute. This novel toothbrush will reciprocate brushing strokes between 800-1700 RPM&#39;s depending on the force with which the user closes down on the toothbrush. This represents anywhere from a 700% to 1000% increase in the number of brushing strokes delivered per minute when compared with manual brushing. In the preferred embodiment, my novel toothbrush comprises an electric brush to facilitate brushing by a user. However, a manual version of the novel toothbrush is substantially identical to the electrical embodiment, but preferably has fewer rows of bristles. The toothbrush includes a flat bristle support member having opposed flat surfaces provided with openings therein for accommodating bundles of tufted bristles. The bundles of tufted bristles are arranged in longitudinally extending rows. The longitudinally aligned tufted bristle bundles include a plurality of interior or central rows which brush the occlusal surfaces of the teeth. A pair of intermediate rows is positioned outwardly of the outermost interior rows, and a pair of exterior rows is positioned outwardly of the intermediate rows. The interior rows of bristle bundles are straight, while the intermediate and exterior rows of bristle bundles are bent or curved and serve to brush the lingual and buccal surfaces of the teeth. The bristle tufts flex open to accommodate the wider molars and flex back in to clean the narrow anterior teeth. Because the brush head provides equal amounts of brushing to both arches as well as the occlusal, buccal, and lingual surfaces, there are no skipped areas due to human error. All of the rows of bristles are disposed in substantially parallel relation to the longitudinal edges of a bristle support member. In the preferred embodiment, the bristles are preferably formed of polyester resin, (although any synthetic resin could theoretically be used) and the bristles are of uniform diameter. Since the flexibility (softness) and rigidity (stiffness) of the bristles of uniform diameter is a function of the bristle length, the exterior rows of bristles bundles, which are the longest, are the most flexible (softest). The intermediate rows of bristle bundles are shorter than the bristles of the exterior rows and are, therefore, less flexible and more rigid than the longer bristles of the exterior rows. The shorter bristles of the three interior rows are the most rigid of the bristles and brush the occlusal surfaces of the teeth. Since the exterior rows of tufted bristle bundles brush the lingual and buccal surfaces of the teeth between the mid-portion and gum line thereof, and since these exterior rows of bristles are the most flexible (softest), there is little likelihood that these bristles will damage or irritate healthy gums and or cervical (root) portion of the teeth. This design will allow the brush head to hold up longer with its various stiffnesses of bristles under occlusal load while breaking up the constantly forming plaque and stimulating gingival tissues back to heath. In the method of shaping the bent bristles of the intermediate and exterior rows, dry heat (rather than steam heat) is used to soften the bristles. The tufted bristle bundles of the intermediate rows have their outer ends bent inwardly over the interior rows, while the bristles of the exterior rows are bent over the bristles of the intermediate rows. A uniquely constructed shaping device is employed, which exerts an inward bending force on the tufted bristle bundles without exerting a longitudinal force on these bristles. The shaping device applied to the tufted bristle bundles of the toothbrush head is placed in a heating chamber and heated to a temperature within the range of 350 to 380 degrees Fahrenheit for a period of approximately 10 minutes.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates generally to the field of crab traps, and more particularly to a commercial crab trap that is uniquely configured in the shape to increase the number of crabs caught by diverting the crabs toward the gate of the trap. Commercial crab harvesting involves the use of many expensive crab traps that are taken out to sea, lowered to the ocean floor where their location is marked with a floating buoy, and left to accumulate crabs. The fishing vessel returns after a couple of days, hopefully locates the buoys that mark the crab traps, and hoists the crab traps aboard to retrieve the catch. Traditional commercial crab traps comprise a frame that is covered by a wire mesh. They will also typically have some type of one-way gate that the crab can crawl through to reach the bait inside the trap and an access door that is used to load the trap with bait and to remove the catch once the crab trap is retrieved. The most common crab traps used by commercial crab harvesters are shaped either like a rectangular box as is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,184,283 (Wyman), or a circular cage like that shown in U.S. Pat. No. 2,760,297 (Buyken). Generally, the one-way gates are either positioned in the center of one or more of the side walls of the rectangular shaped traps, or they are equally spaced around the circumference of the circular shape traps. A commercial crab fishing vessel can set hundreds of crab traps at any one time. Each of these crab traps must be filled by hand with bait and also emptied of their catch by hand. The current practice is to fill the crab traps through access doors that are secured shut by using a heavy rubber strap with a hook on its end (similar to a bungee cord). An example of this type of strap is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,509,288 (Sheperd). To bait the trap the rubber strap is stretched by hand until the hook can be pulled free and the rubber strap is retracted. This allows the access door to be opened. The trap is then filled with bait, the access door closed, and the rubber strap is stretched by hand over the access door until the hook can grab the mesh under enough tension to keep the access door closed. Stretching this rubber strap by hand hundreds, if not thousands, of times over the course of a season often leads to repetitive motion injuries and considerable soreness and pain. A commercial crab trap is typically made from iron that is often rubber coated. Iron is the material of choice because it is inexpensive and its weight helps to hold the crab trap in the same position on the ocean floor. Iron, however, is particularly susceptible to corrosive effect of the sea water which means that the crab traps rust over a few years of use and have to be replaced. Largely because crab traps are so often lost, the industry has been hesitant to make the crab traps from more expensive materials like stainless steel. Although marine aluminum (50/58) or (60/61) is relatively inexpensive and strong, the industry has not used it because it is not thought to be heavy enough to anchor the crab trap to the ocean floor. A search of the patent literature has disclosed a number of other patents. U.S. Pat. No. 4,411,092 (Lalancette) shows a trap in which there are walls which converge upwardly and laterally to an upwardly facing entrance opening in the area at which tee walls meet. The fish enter through the opening and are trapped. There is a door 9, for the removal of the caught fish. U.S. Pat. No. 3,772,818 (Gardina) shows a crustacean trap in which there are funnel shaped elements 39, through which the crustacean enters. The crustacean is removed through door 44. U.S. Pat. No. 4,730,892 (Cos et al) shows a lobster trap in which prey falls to the bottom of the structure after entering. U.S. Pat. No. 3,440,758 (Prince) shows a collapsible crab trap in which there is an upper and lower solid ring that between the mesh sides are stretched. The mesh walls converge to points at which there are entrance openings. U.S. Pat. No. 2,163,973 (Benca et al) show a fish trap in which there is an entrance funnel area 17, through which the fish enter. U.S. Pat. No. 991,7450 (Mournian) shows a fish trap formed with converging walls at the entrance. U.S. Pat. No. 605,834 (Albury) shows a fish trap in which there is an entrance on one side where the walls converge. British Patent specification No. 368,686 shows a device to trap fish where there is a circular frame, and a source of light is positioned at the center of this frame. The fish are attracted to the light and swim toward the trap. The trap has six cone shaped (funnel shaped) wire members H-1, each of which defines a radially inwardly extending converging passageway. There is a downwardly extending net f closed by a drawstring g. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The arrangement of the present invention significantly improves the efficiency of the trap in capturing crabs. It is believed that crabs move in and out with the tide in generally straight lines. If a crab encounters an obstacle, it somewhat reluctantly moves around it and continues to drift in a straight line in the direction of the tide. With the crab traps currently in use, if the crab encounters the door of the trap it will probably enter and feed on the bait. However, if the crab encounters the side wall of a circular trap where there is no door, the crab will continue to follow the current and deflect outwardly away from the trap or it will climb on top of the pot. Similarly, if a crab encounters the side wall of a rectangular trap, it will move to one side or the other in order to continue swimming with the tide. If the crab moves toward the door it will probably enter. However, if the crab moves in the direction opposite the door it will be free of the trap and will continue to drift away with the tide. In the present invention, the shape of the trap takes advantage of the crab&#39;s natural tendency to move with the tide in the direction of the least resistance. A crab that encounters the crab trap from any direction will encounter either the gate or a deflection wall that will guide the crab to the gate in the path of least resistance to the direction of the tide. Since the crab would have to back up against the tide to move away from the trap, it is more likely to move forwardly along the inward slant of the diversion walls toward the access opening and the inviting bait. It is important to emphasize that the shape of the crab trap means that any side surface of the trap that the crab encounters will slant inwardly toward one of the entrance gates. This means that all forward motion that the crab makes will move it closer to its capture. While the crab trap of the present invention is intended for commercial use, it could easily be scaled to a manageable size for recreational use, it should also be understood that the crab trap can be used for the capture of other crustaceans such as lobsters and can be used in both salt and fresh water.",

    "abstract": "These disadvantages are to be avoided according to this invention, which is characterized in that the saw blade has at least one closed aperture, which extends in the direction away from the row of teeth, wherein the part of the saw blade between the row of teeth and the aperture comprises a strip-like element. In particular, in the field of bone surgery a cool cutting, as obtained by the inventive device, is of great importance. As a consequence of the provision of an aperture, the surface of the saw blade exposed to friction with the object to be sawn is markedly reduced. Thereby, in the cutting process of a bone, there will result less bleeding of the adjacent tissue, so that the view of the cut is much better. Thereby, cuts of the highest precision are possible and in addition the subsequent healing process is speedier. It is also important that, as a consequence of the presence of the aperture, there is always enough room for saw chips or saw dust, thus avoiding a compound of bone dust. If it is necessary to use a rinsing with a fluid, the sterile fluid can flush the bone dust away. It is not necessary that the fluid run down the sidewalls of the blade; it will enter directly into the aperture. A corresponding process applies to a cooling fluid in an industrial use. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS These and other objects of the invention will become apparent from the following description of preferred embodiments and the drawings, in which: FIG. 1 is a front view in elevation of a saw blade for an oscillating saw; FIG. 2 is a side view in cross-section along the line 2--2 of FIG. 1; FIG. 3 is a partial view of enlarged teeth of the saw blade according to FIG. 1; FIG. 4 is a front view of another embodiment of an oscillating saw blade of this invention; FIG. 5 is a cross-section along the line 5--5 of FIG. 4; FIG. 6 is a front view in elevation of a circular saw blade of this invention; FIG. 7 is a front view of a saw blade having the teeth of this invention in the form of a hack saw; FIG. 8 is a front view in elevation of another example of an oscillating saw blade; and FIG. 9 is a cross-section along the line 9--9 of FIG. 8.",

    "abstract": "For achieving this object, the present invention suggests that the main sleeve body and the guiding sleeve body are provided on their surfaces facing each other with at least one projection and/or at least one recess engaging each other. Moreover, it is of advantage that a guiding sleeve body is inserted at the upper and lower end of the main sleeve body, the projections and recesses thereby forming a simple plug connection in order to fasten the guiding sleeve bodies in the axial direction. One may use simple low-cost injection-moulded parts so that not only the number of component parts is reduced but also a simple and fast mounting becomes possible. The guiding sleeve bodies have such dimensions that the guiding sleeve unit consisting of the main sleeve body and the guiding sleeve bodies can be pressed into a metal base tube. It is another essential feature of the present invention that in case of employment of more than one projection and/or recess these projections and recesses are peripherally distributed over the respective sleeve body. An especially preferred embodiment provides that the main sleeve body has only recesses and the guiding sleeve bodies have only projections. This entails the advantage that the guiding sleeve bodies have no interruptions at all on their entire bearing faces so that a precalibration of the inner diameter of the guiding sleeve bodies is possible. An especially preferred embodiment provides that the recesses are provided in an axial front area of the main sleeve body. Another essential feature provides that, when seen in mounting direction, the projections have a face of steadily enlarging diameter. This face begins at the outer diameter of the guiding sleeve body and enlarges correspondingly so that these faces serve as entry guide slopes during the mounting operation by first forming a radially inwardly directed bend and then springing back to their normal position after having reached the recesses. Such a spring catch connection can no longer be loosened after insertion of the gas spring in its assembled state. To ensure an axial lock to the outside, the present invention suggests that on the side opposite to the mounting direction the projections have a face extending approximately perpendicular to the axis of the bearing. According to an especially preferred embodiment, the main sleeve body and the guiding sleeve body consist of different materials. It is advantageous to make the guiding sleeve bodies from a material from which anti-friction sliding bearings are made. By using exclusively plastic materials for the guiding sleeve bodies and the main sleeve body, a back-lash-free and low-friction guidance is achieved to guide the gas spring axially, radially and rotationally. Another preferred embodiment suggests that the guiding sleeve body has been precalibrated. Thereby, the assembling operation will be easy and quick; the spring catch connection as a whole can be pressed into the metal base tube, and no refinishing operations will have to be done. According to a further aspect, the present invention refers to a column unit comprising a base tube having an axis, a first end and a second end. Support means are provided adjacent the second end. A height adjusting unit is provided partially inside the base tube. This height adjusting unit has a first height adjustment component extending along the axis inward and outward of the first end of the base tube and further has a second height adjustment component axially movable with respect to the first height adjustment component. The second height adjustment component is lockable in selected axial positions with respect to the first height adjustment component. The second height adjustment component is substantially axially fixed with respect to the support means. The first height adjustment component has a substantially cylindrical external surface along at least a part of its axial length. The base tube is provided adjacent its first end with a guiding sleeve unit. The first height adjustment component is slidingly guided for at least one of axial and rotational movement by the guiding sleeve unit. The guiding sleeve unit comprises a main sleeve body and at least one guiding sleeve body substantially radially inside of the main sleeve body and slidingly engaging the cylindrical external surface of the first height adjustment component. The at least one guiding sleeve body is axially secured with respect to the main sleeve body by snapping engagement means of the main sleeve body and the guiding sleeve body snappingly engaging each other in response to axial positioning of said guiding sleeve body with respect to the main sleeve body. The column unit is preferably used as a height-adjustable chair column unit. The height adjusting unit is preferably a hydraulically or pneumatically lockable unit, such as a gas spring, which gas spring comprises a cylinder, a piston rod, a piston member connected with the piston rod inside the cylinder, a pair of working chambers on both sides of the piston member inside the cylinder and a flow passage connecting the working chambers with a valve unit permitting to selectively open or close said flow passage. Such a gas spring is e.g. shown in DE-OS 36 27 138 and the corresponding U.S. Pat. No. 4,848,524. Further, hydropneumatic units may be used as height adjustment units in which liquid filled working chambers are provided adjacent the piston member, and one of the working chambers is adjacent a volume of pressurized gas. With such hydraulic or pneumatic height adjustment units one can continuously vary the effective length by opening the valve unit and fix a desired length by subsequent closing of the valve unit. The guiding sleeve body may be located axially adjacent at least one end of the main sleeve body, e. g. the guiding sleeve body may be provided adjacent a first end of the main sleeve body which is more remote from the second end of the base tube. Alternatively, respective guiding sleeve bodies may be provided adjacent both ends of the main sleeve body. The main sleeve body may have radially outer surface means radially engaged with an internal surface of the base tube. The main sleeve body may be axially fixed with respect to the base tube. e.g., the main sleeve body may be axially fixed with respect to the base tube against movement toward the second end thereof by abutment means of the main sleeve body engaging the second end of the base tube. Moreover, the main sleeve body may be axially secured against movement away from the second end of the base tube by releasable securing means. According to a preferred embodiment, the at least one guiding sleeve body comprises a substantially cylindrical guiding tube member with an inner circumferential guiding surface slidingly engaging the substantially cylindrical external surface of the first height adjustment component and an outer circumferential surface adjacent an inner substantially cylindrical surface of the main sleeve body. In such an embodiment the substantially cylindrical guiding tube member may be provided adjacent a respective end of the main sleeve body with at least one radially outward projecting positioning projection. This positioning projection may engage into a respective recess of the main sleeve body axially adjacent a respective end of the main sleeve body. In this embodiment, the guiding sleeve body is circumferentially positioned with respect to the main sleeve body. Simultaneously, the main sleeve body may be secured against rotation with respect to the base tube. Under these circumstances, rotation is only possible at the interface between the first height adjustment component and the guiding tube member, where one can easily select a reduced friction providing a desired frictional torque. Alternatively, the at least one projection can also be provided by the main sleeve body,and correspondingly, the recess may be provided by the guiding sleeve body. It is preferred, however, to have the projection or the projections on the radially outer side of the guiding sleeve body in order to have the very best sliding behaviour between the first height adjustment component and the guiding sleeve body. In this case, a precalibration of the guiding sleeve body is easily possible with the advantageous result that after assembling the guiding sleeve body and the main sleeve body and also after inserting this preassembly into the base tube no further calibration of the inner circumferential guiding surface of the guiding sleeve body is necessary. For obtaining the above-mentioned snapping engagement between the main sleeve body and the at least one guiding sleeve body the snapping engagement means of one of the main sleeve body and the at least one guiding sleeve body may comprise sloped deflection face means inclined with respect to the axis and snapping shoulder means adjacent an axial end of the sloped deflection face means. Then, the snapping engagement means of the other one of the main sleeve body and the guiding sleeve body may be resiliently deflectable by engagement with the sloped deflection face means in response to an axial positioning movement of the guiding sleeve body with respect to the main sleeve body and engageable behind the shoulder means in an operational position of the guiding sleeve body with respect to the main sleeve body. The at least one positioning projection of the guiding sleeve body may be provided with the sloped deflection face means and the snapping shoulder means. With such a design, the recess may be provided with a radially inward directed engagement web deflectable by the sloped deflection face means in response to axially approaching the guiding sleeve body to an operational position of the guiding sleeve body with respect to the main sleeve body. Then, the engagement web may snap behind the shoulder face means, when the operational position is achieved.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to compounds for delivering active agents, such as biologically or chemically active agents, to a target. These compounds are well suited for forming non-covalent mixtures with active agents for oral, intracolonic, pulmonary, or other routes of administration to animals. Methods for the preparation and administration of such compositions are also disclosed. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Conventional means for delivering active agents are often severely limited by biological, chemical, and physical barriers. Typically, these barriers are imposed by the environment through which delivery occurs, the environment of the target for delivery, and/or the target itself. Biologically and chemically active agents are particularly vulnerable to such barriers. In the delivery to animals of biologically active and chemically active pharmacological and therapeutic agents, barriers are imposed by the body. Examples of physical barriers are the skin, lipid bi-layers and various organ membranes that are relatively impermeable to certain active agents but must be traversed before reaching a target, such as the circulatory system. Chemical barriers include, but are not limited to, pH variations in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and degrading enzymes. These barriers are of particular significance in the design of oral delivery systems. Oral delivery of many biologically or chemically active agents would be the route of choice for administration to animals if not for biological, chemical, and physical barriers. Among the numerous agents which are not typically amenable to oral administration are biologically or chemically active peptides, such as calcitonin and insulin; polysaccharides, and in particular mucopolysaccharides including, but not limited to, heparin; heparinoids; antibiotics; and other organic substances. These agents may be rapidly rendered ineffective or destroyed in the gastro-intestinal tract by acid hydrolysis, enzymes, and the like. In addition, the size and structure of macromolecular drugs may prohibit absorption. Earlier methods for orally administering vulnerable pharmacological agents have relied on the co-administration of adjuvants (e.g., resorcinols and non-ionic surfactants such as polyoxyethylene oleyl ether and n-hexadecylpolyethylene ether) to increase artificially the permeability of the intestinal walls, as well as the co-administration of enzymatic inhibitors (e.g., pancreatic trypsin inhibitors, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFF) and trasylol) to inhibit enzymatic degradation. Liposomes have also been described as drug delivery systems for insulin and heparin. However, broad spectrum use of such drug delivery systems is precluded because: (1) the systems require toxic amounts of adjuvants or inhibitors; (2) suitable low molecular weight cargos, i.e. active agents, are not available; (3) the systems exhibit poor stability and inadequate shelf life; (4) the systems are difficult to manufacture; (5) the systems fail to protect the active agent (cargo); (6) the systems adversely alter the active agent; or (7) the systems fail to allow or promote absorption of the active agent. More recently, proteinoid microspheres have been used to deliver pharmaceuticals. For example, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,401,516, U.S. Pat. No. 5,443,841 and U.S. Pat. No. RE35,862. In addition, certain modified amino acids have been used to deliver pharmaceuticals. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,629,020; U.S. Pat. No. 5,643,957; U.S. Pat. No. 5,766,633; U.S. Pat. No. 5,776,888; and U.S. Pat. No. 5,866,536. However, there is still a need for simple, inexpensive delivery systems which are easily prepared and which can deliver a broad range of active agents by various routes. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Compounds and compositions that are useful in the delivery of active agents are provided. The present invention encompasses compounds having the following formula, or salts thereof, or mixtures thereof.",

    "abstract": "Scleroderma or Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune connective tissue disorder of unknown cause characterized by microvascular injury, excessive fibrosis of the skin, and distinctive visceral involvement including the heart, lung, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract. Scleroderma is a progressive condition in which fibrous tissue grows abnormally, causing the skin to thicken and harden, often disfiguring and disabling patients. It affects between 5,000-10,000 new persons annually (USA) and is associated with a high morbidity and a poor prognosis. Overall, scleroderma affects an estimated 300,000 Americans, most of them women. Forty percent of all scleroderma patients develop at least moderate restrictive lung disease. A high proportion of scleroderma patients (80 percent) develop lung involvement, either interstitial lung disease and/or pulmonary hypertension, which are the leading causes of death due to scleroderma. The mortality rate in scleroderma patients with severe restrictive lung disease is about 30 percent within 10 years of onset. The statistics underscore the need for effective treatment, preferably at an early stage in the illness, to prevent progression to severe interstitial lung disease. SSc is treated with oral medications to halt the progression of disease. These drugs include cyclophosphamide, high-dose prednisolone or even stem cell transplantation, all having severe side effects. In SSc, drugs that improve circulation, promote gastrointestinal function, preserve kidney function, and control high blood pressure are also given. Cyclophosphamide is an anti-cancer drug that suppresses the immune system. This is the first drug that has been proven to alleviate the most devastating effects of SSc. Patients taking cyclophosphamide had a significant improvement in lung function and a reduction in breathlessness. Although many research groups work on the unraveling of SSc pathogenesis, to date, the exact pathways underlying the pathogenesis of SSc remain unknown. Currently, most of the research is focused on the underlying pathways that cause fibroblast activation. A deregulated growth and activation of fibroblasts has often suggested to be implicated in SSc. However, a mode of action that is responsible for this ongoing activation of fibroblasts has not been identified.",

    "abstract": "The object of the invention is thus to define a possibility of treating diseases of the inner ear, more particularly in the case of tinnitus, with which a perceptible compensation of the symptoms associated with the disease is achieved. More particularly, the tormenting ear noise is made to disappear or diminished to such a degree that the patient reattains his normal quality of life. This object is achieved by the use of formulua I adamantane derivatives as claimed. It has been surprisingly discovered that, more particularly, tinnitus can be effectively compensated by use of the compounds cited. Further fields of application may materialize in the treatment of chronic inner ear deafness, sudden deafness or morbus Meniere. An improvement in hearing in the case of inner ear deafness can be achieved by the use in accordance with the invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION As already mentioned, the use of adamantane derivatives is possible or conceivable in many cases of diseases of the inner ear. Preferably, adamantane derivatives can be used in the case of inner ear diseases in which troublesome ear noise, so-called tinnitus occurs, especially in the case of treating such forms of tinnitus as chronic tinnitus, subacute tinnitus or also acute permanent tinnitus, since it is just these patients that require intensive therapy. In addition to other inner ear diseases those in which tinnitus occurs often involving loss of hearing (deafness) are concerned. In a tinnitus occurrence this loss of hearing lies in the frequency range of the tinnitus, the impaired hearing being associated with a so-called positive recruitment and/or (amplitude) reduction or failure of otoacoustic emissions. The so-called positive recruitment is a phenomenon in audiometry when a comparison of the loudness is undertaken in the case of one-sided deafness. In the case of positive recruitment a slight amplification is needed in the ear impaired in hearing to prompt the same loudness sensitivity as for the healthy ear, i.e. the loss in hearing is compensated by increasing loudness. The so-called otoacoustic emissions are noise events occurring in the external canal having to do with the condition of the middle ear or inner ear. Otoacoustic emissions may occur spontaneously, i.e. without the ear receiving external stimulation or also being evoked externally, for example with the aid of a sound emitter. Both the occurrence of positive recruitment and the reduction or failure of otoacoustic emissions can be measured and thus an inner ear dysfunction assigned to the patients concerned. Should a patient be inflicted simultaneously with a tinnitus and a reduction in hearing in the corresponding frequency range of the tinnitus associated with a positive recruitment and/or reduction or failure of otoacoustic emissions, it can be concluded that an impairement or dysfunction of the outer hair cells and its cochlear amplifier is involved. Since this dysfunction is improved or eliminated by the use in accordance with the invention a new active mechanism must be at the bottom of it all which is not in keeping with applications for adamantane derivatives known hitherto. It is known that, for example, no NMDA receptors exist on the outer hair cells thus eliminating any antagonistic effect for such receptors. A glutamate otoneurotoxicity as postulated by Ehrenberger/Felix does not come into question since glutamate is non-toxic for hair cells. One possible explanation may be that the adamantane derivatives directly affect other receptors present on the outer hair cells, for example, purine receptors and acetylcholine receptors. In addition to this, there are indications as to a further mechanism which relates to the effect of adamantane derivatives with subsequent steps in stimulation transmission by which the adamantane derivatives may obstruct the cation transporter relaying the return transport of neurotransmitters from the synaptic gap in the presynapse, resulting in a depletion of the neurotransmitter in the efferent presynapsis and thus (indirectly) in reduced stimulation of receptors. This mechanism developing at the presynapse, i.e. before the synaptic gap could be effective in the form described along the full hearing passage up to the auditory cortex. Formula I adamantane derivatives can be employed as described by the formula or preferably in the form of their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hydrobromides, sulphates, acetates, succinates, tartrates, for example, or, more particularly, the hydrochlorides belonging to these additional salts. Likewise, other salts as usual may be represented and employed. The quantity of the adamantane derivatives used is normally not critical, it materializing for the person skilled in the art as usual from values gained from experience or by implementing trial and error tests prior to application. Expediently the quantities used are typically between approximately 0.01 and approximately 100 mg/kg body-weight, preferably from approximately 0.1 to approximately 1 mg/kg body-weight, whereby quantities of approximately 0.1 to approximately 0.5 mg/kg body-weight are preferred in the last-mentioned range. As mentioned, the invention covers the use of all formula I amino adamantanes for treatment of diseases of the inner ear. Examples of such compounds are listed, for example, in EP-B1-392059, the contents of which are accordingly made that of the present description. Preferred formula I compounds are those in which R1 and R2 signify hydrogen H and compounds in which R5 and, more particularly, additionally R1 and R2 signify the hydrogen residue. In the already cited preferred compounds and also in other formula I compounds the residues R3 and R4 are optionally a methyl or ethyl residue. One particularly preferred compound employable in accordance with the invention is memantine, i.e. 1-amino-3.5-dimethyladamantane or the hydrochloride thereof, memantine HCl. This compound or its salt is particularly suitable for the treatment of diseases of the inner ear, especially in treating tinnitus. The invention otherwise involves also a method of treating diseases of the inner ear in which an effective quantity of an adamantane derivative having the general formula I is administered. A corresponding method is suitable, more particularly, for the treatment of tinnitus, reference being made to the particular aspects of the administration already described as regards the compounds employable and the quantities used. One preferred embodiment of the use in accordance with the invention materializes from the description of a clinical application example described in the following, whereby the individual features resulting therefrom may be achieved singly or in combination with each other.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to tobacco smoking products and more particularly to increasing the filling power of the tobacco filler constituents of a smoking product through the addition of a solution of the ions of multivalent metal or organic acid salts, which interact with the pectinaceous substances of the tobacco to stiffen and to firmly bind said pectinaceous substances to maintain an expanded form. 2. Description of the Prior Art It is desirable to increase the filling power of tobacco products so that a consequent reduction in the total amount of tobacco utilized, such as in a tobacco rod, is comparatively realized. Since the filling power is often realized through the use of tobacco constituents, including reconstituted tobacco, which are found in shredded form, it is desired that the filler tobacco assume an expanded bulk volume which is retained over long periods of time such that, after casing, the firmness of the tobacco rod, as packed, will not be lost. Included among the approaches to increasing the filling power of tobacco, to cause the tobacco to assume and to retain an expanded physical state, are processes which cause cellular expansion such as puffing, or flash heating, freeze-drying and modifications thereof. Results of up to a two fold increase in filling power by these methods are not uncommon; however, the puffing and freeze-drying processes require relatively extreme conditions which, if not carefully controlled, may impair the subjective smoking quality of the tobacco. The freeze-drying process, especially, as illustrated by U.S. Pat. No. 3,710,802 to William H. Johnson and British Pat. Specification No. 1,293,735 to American Brands, Inc., requires the utilization of extensive apparati in a multi-step process which includes, for example, means for controlling atmospheric pressure during the final sublimation stage. Puffing, the application of high pressure steam followed by a sudden release of pressure, does not necessarily assure that the tobacco constituents will retain the expanded form, as noted by de la Burde, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,556,112. Loss of the expanded state and firmness over time is due to plasmolysis and cell contraction, occurring during drying stages, which tend to cause expanded tobacco to return to its original form. Other patents to de la Burde relating to expansion of tobacco stems by utilizing heat treatment or microwave energy are U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,409,022, 3,409,023, 3,409,027 and 3,409,028. U.S. Pat. No. 3,734,104 to William M. Buchanan et al., also relates to a process for the expansion of tobacco stems. A variation of puffing, the impregnation in and subsequent release of organic solvents from the tobacco to increase the bulk volume, requires that substantially all of the organic solvent has been removed from the expanded tobacco since these substances may adversely affect the subjective smoking quality of the tobacco. Examples of using a volatile organic liquid, such as a halogenated hydrocarbon, are U.S. Pat. No. 3,524,452 to Glen P. Moser et al., and U.S. Pat. No. 3,524,451 to James D. Frederickson. Additional methods of expansion include the treatment of tobacco with solid materials which, when heated, decompose to produce gases which serve to expand the tobacco. Other methods include the treatment of tobacco with gas-containing liquids, such as carbon dioxide-containing water, under pressure to incorporate the gas in the tobacco. The tobacco impregnated therewith is heated or the pressure thereon is reduced to thereby expand the tobacco. Gases which react to form solid chemical reaction products within the tobacco, have also been utilized to expand tobacco. The solid reaction products may then be decomposed by heat to produce gases within the tobacco which cause expansion of the tobacco upon the release of the gas. U.S. Pat. No. 1,789,435, granted in 1931, to Wilford J. Hawkins, describes a method and apparatus for expanding the volume of tobacco in order to make up the loss of weight caused in curing tobacco leaf. To accomplish this object, the cured and conditioned tobacco is contacted with a gas, which may be air, carbon dioxide or steam under about 20 pounds of pressure and the pressure is then releived, whereby the tobacco tends to expand. The patent states that the volume of tobacco may, by that process, be increased to the extent of about 5-15%. An alien property custodian document No. 304,214 to Joachim Bohme, dated 1943, indicates that tobacco can be expanded using a high-frequency generator. There are limitations to the degree of expansion which can be achieved without affecting the subjective smoking quality of the tobacco. A publication in the &#34;Tobacco Reporter&#34; of November 1969 by P. S. Meyer summarized tobacco puffing and expansion procedures, investigations of expanding and manipulating tobacco for purposes of reducing costs and means for reducing the &#34;tar&#34; content by reduction. Mention is made in this publication of puffing tobacco by different procedures including the use of halogenated hydrocarbons, low pressure or vacuum operation, or high pressure steam treatment that causes leaf expansion from inside the cell when outside pressure is suddenly released. South African applications Nos. 70/8291 and 70/8292 to R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, both filed in 1970, relate to tobacco expansion employing chemical compounds which decompose to form a gas or employing inert solutions of a gas under pressure to maintain the gas in solution until it impregnates the tobacco. A patent to Robert G. Armstrong et al., U.S. Pat. No. 3,771,533, involves a treatment of tobacco with carbon dioxide and ammonia gases, whereby the tobacco is saturated with these gases and ammonium carbonate is formed in situ. The ammonium carbonate is thereafter decomposed by heat to release the gases within the tobacco cells and causes expansion of the tobacco. A patent to Frank J. Sowa, U.S. Pat. No. 2,596,183, granted in 1952, sets forth a method for increasing the volume of shredded tobacco by adding additional water to the tobacco to cause the tobacco to swell. Thereafter, the moisture-containing tobacco is heated, whereby the moisture evaporates and the resulting moisture vapor causes expansion of the tobacco. The present invention, in comparison with prior art methods of increasing filling power, achieves an increased filling power on the order of 10 to 25%, by means of the utilization of an efficient and economical one-step process. The additive multivalent salt, after a drying step, maintains the tobacco in expanded form. Further, the solution of the multivalent metal or organic acid salt is applied to the total tobacco filler constituent blend. Other methods of expansion do not generally involve expanding all of the tobacco of a particular smoking blend or product. Instead, generally only part of the tobacco filler for a particular blend is expanded. This expanded tobacco is then added with more dense unexpanded tobacco. The present invention assures a uniform blend since the entire blend, composed of shredded tobacco constituents, is treated and expanded. Frankenberg, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,598,680, 2,955,601, and 2,706,695 utilized water swelling clays, preferably bentonite, or water-soluble derivatives of cellulose to improve the cohesiveness and homogeneity of sheets of shredded tobacco products, while yet maintaining the subjective smoking quality thereof. It will be noted that, in U.S. Pat. No. 2,598,608, multivalent metals may be utilized, but in minute amounts, to make the binding agent soluble. In U.S. Pat. No. 2,955,601, Frankenberg teaches the use of the salts of organic acids, in combination with a non-salt cellulose binding agent, for coloring purposes. Finally, Frankenberg in U.S. Pat. No. 2,706,695 utilized cellulose with a silicious mineral type material which acts as a catalyst to promote combustion of undesired components of smoke through the use of mineral type materials, including clays and silicates, which have active hydrogen atoms. Many acids and salts have been utilized in the art for purposes similar to the later Frankenberg patent, primarily to combat, by combustion, the undesired alkaline by-products in the smoke of combustion. For example Sutter, U.S. Pat. No. 2,172,946 utilized natural acids to combat the undesirable effects of smoke alkalinity. Jones, U.S. Pat. No. 2,766,145 utilized esters which, upon combustion, would yield flavoring organic carboxylic acids. Tyrer, et al., U.S. Pat. No. 2,914,072 utilized metallic and organic salts in combination, as catalysts, to promote greater combustion and thermal destruction of the undesirable alkaline, especially nicotine-base alkaline, by-products found in the smoke. Tyrer, et al., further noted that use of sulfates is particularly undesirable since the purpose of the invention was to promote combustion. Sowa, U.S. Pat. No. 2,429,567, teaches a method of denicotinizing tobacco by means of utilizing salts, especially chloride salts, to bind with the nicotine released upon burning. Sowa also noted that sulfates, such as zinc sulfate, are undesirable due to the fact the sulfates readily oxidize and do not bind the nicotine.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to compositions of matter having utility in maintaining oral health. It also relates to methods of making such compositions, and the incorporation of same into pharmaceutically suitable vehicles for use in oral health care. More particularly, the invention relates to acyl derivatives of arginine, optionally in combination with fluoride compounds, and their utility in maintaining oral health. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It has been shown that tooth decay and dental disease can be attributed to bacteria forming plaque about the teeth. Growth and proliferation of bacteria is enhanced by the presence of entrapped food particles between the teeth. The removal of plaque and entrapped food particles reduces caries, reduces the tendency towards gingivitis, and reduces mouth odor as well as generally improving oral hygiene. The prior art recognizes mechanical oral hygiene devices serving to clean the mouth of debris and remove plaque from teeth, such as toothbrushes, flosses, and toothpicks. It also recognizes compositions mostly used in conjunction with such devices but which impart a chemical action in cleaning teeth, such as dentifrices and rinses. In addition to these, various dental coatings and sealants have been applied to teeth as barriers against bacterial action and plaque formation. Another important approach in oral care includes the use of various fluoride-containing preparations which are able to deposit fluoride ions directly onto the surface of tooth enamel. While great advances were made in oral health care by the use of these various approaches, none seem to be completely effective. A more recent approach to improved oral hygiene involves the recognition that bacteria present in the oral cavity metabolize dietary sugars, such as glucose and sucrose, to organic acids, such as acetic, propionic and lactic acids. The production of these acids results in a rapid drop in plaque pH. If the pH drops to a level of about 5.5 or below and remains there for more than a short period of time, the tooth enamel will begin to demineralize. This process, if repeated over a substantial period of time, will eventually lead to the development of caries. To correct for the pH drop, the saliva contains a pH-rise factor which moderates the extent and duration of the pH drop when glucose and sucrose are metabolized by oral bacteria. This factor was identified as an arginine-containing tetrapeptide. See, for example, Kleinberg, I., Kanapka, J. A., and Craw, D. &#34;Effect of Saliva and Salivary Factors on the Metabolism of the Mixed Oral Flora&#34; Microbial Aspects of Dental Caries, Vol. II, pp. 433-464 (1976). This pH-rise factor is believed to enter the bacterial cell and either neutralize the organic acids as they form or alter bacterial metabolism so that the acids are not produced. DISCUSSION OF THE PRIOR ART U.S. Pat. No. 2,689,170 to King, entitled &#34;Oral Preparation for Inhibition of Dental Caries&#34;, discloses oral preparations for inhibition of dental caries having as the active ingredient a saturated higher series of alkyl acyl amide of a saturated aliphatic monoaminocarboxylic acid compound. U.S. Pat. No. 4,154,813 to Kleinberg, entitled &#34;Means and Method for Improving Natural Defenses Against Caries&#34;, discloses a method for supplementing the body&#39;s resistance to caries by providing a pH-rise factor which is a peptide of 2-4 amino acid units, one or more of which is arginine. U.S. Pat. No. 4,225,579 to Kleinberg, entitled &#34;Means and Method for Improving Defenses Against Caries&#34;, claims peptides of 2-4 amino acid units, one or more of which is arginine, for combatting caries. These arginine-containing peptides are disclosed to penetrate dental plaque and bacteria in the mouth and to counteract acid produced as a result of metabolism of carbohydrates. British Pat. No. 1,352,420 to Yoshinaga et al, entitled &#34;Novel Arginine Derivatives, their Production and their Use&#34;, discloses N.sup.α -acylarginines having antibacterial or germicidal properties for use in oral hygiene. U.S. Pat. No. 3,809,759 to Bocher and Faure, entitled &#34;Pharmaceutical Composition for Treating Mental Fatigue Containing Arginine-Potassium Phospho-Citro-Glutamate and Method of Using the Same&#34;, discloses arginine-potassium phospho-citro-glutamate in pharmaceutical compositions, such as, granules, pills, tablets, and capsules for systemic treatment of mental fatigue. U.S. Pat. No. 4,061,542 to Demny and Maehr, entitled &#34;2-Methyl-L-Arginine Produced by Cultivating Streptomyces Strain&#34;, discloses the title compound for use as an antibiotic and antibacterial agent. U.S. Pat. No. 4,125,619 to Okamoto et al, entitled &#34;N.sup.α -Naphthalenesulfonyl-L-Arginine Derivatives and the Pharmaceutically Acceptable Acid Addition Salts Thereof&#34;, discloses the title compounds for use as pharmaceutical agents for the inhibition and suppression of thrombosis. Some long-chain N G  -acyl derivatives of arginine are described in the chemical literature. See for example, Guttmann, St. and Pless, J. &#34;On the Protection of the Guanidino Group of Arginine&#34;, Acta Chim Acad. Sci. Hung 44 (1-2), 23-30 (1965). The acyl groups are temporarily placed on the arginine molecule at the N G  -position and serve as temporary blocking or protecting groups which are subsequently removed from the N G  -position when the appropriate substituents are placed on the N.sup.α -position of arginine. These blocking groups thus serve to protect the N G  -position from chemically reacting while the nitrogen atom at the N.sup.α -position participates in the chemical reaction. The compounds of the present invention differ from the aforementioned prior art in that we use new and novel derivatives of arginine in which the polar character of the arginine molecule is modified by the presence of lipid-like substituents. This modification is believed to permit such arginine derivatives to more readily penetrate the phospholipid-containing cell wall of oral bacteria and to inhibit acid production of these bacteria. Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to provide new and novel derivatives of arginine. Another object of the present invention is to provide compositions containing an arginine derivative for use in oral applications. Still another object of the present invention is to provide compositions containing an arginine derivative in combination with a fluoride compound for use in oral applications. It is still a further object of the present invention to provide methods of preparing such compounds and compositions.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to an apparatus which automatically washes, sanitizes and drys a toilet seat, can be retrofitted and is compatible with present toilet systems. The automatic toilet seat cleaning system, according to the principles of this invention, comprises a toilet seat, a toilet seat cover, a runoff pan or water collector and a control unit. The toilet seat cover comprises of three separate conduits utilized for fluid and gas agents. The two fluid conduits are located in the inner and the outer rims of the seat cover and have small holes for the impingement of fluid against the toilet seat on the outer and the inner areas to ensure that the complete surface of the seat is washed. The third conduit which is used for gas or hot air, is located in the middle rim of the cover and has larger openings to ensure the proper flow of gas or hot air to dry the seat. The toilet seat comprises a water collector and a seat which are separated through a spacer that creates a fluid passage to the toilet bowl. By closing the toilet seat cover, the outer edge of the seat cover fits into the inner edge of the water collector thereby sealing the toilet and the water collector. The sealing of the toilet permits the fluid to dispense, through small holes, with great force against the seat. The control unit comprises an automatic electric or electronic means that provides two cycles: a cleaning and sterilizing cycle with the fluid; and a drying cycle. The control unit further comprises an automatic fluid control valve that is connected to a water source, a chemical mixing chamber, and a blower means with a heating element which is used for the drying cycle. The control unit further comprises a central process unit which controls and adjusts the starting and finishing time of the washing and drying cycles. An alternative design of the toilet seat cover comprises a fluid conduit and a planar channel conduit within the seat cover. The fluid conduit is located in the outer rim of the seat cover having small holes for the impingement of the fluid against the toilet seat.

Shoes having replaceable soles are well known in the prior art. One such shoe, which is particularly adapted for use by fishermen, is sold by Korkers Products, LLC. This shoe is disclosed in patent application Ser. No. 10/293,188, now U.S. Pat. No. 6,813,847. This shoe includes a cavity in its sole which receives a sole plate having a tread pattern on its lower surface. A tab located at the front of the sole plate fits into a slot formed in the cavity sidewall to hold the front end of the sole plate in place. A strap, which is attached to the rear of the sole plate, can be attached to an attachment device located at the back of the shoe to hold the rear end of the sole plate in place. A piece of interfitting releasable fastener material may be located on the sole plate and sole near the center of the sole plate to hold the center of the sole plate in place. While this shoe works well for its intended purpose, it does have several shortcomings. First, the interfitting releasable fastener loses its holding ability with repeated use, particularly when exposed to sand. Second, sand can get in the slot at the front of the cavity and cause the front end of the sole plate to become offset downwardly with respect to the remainder of the sole. Finally, the attachment device at the rear of the shoe which receives the strap attached to the rear of the sole plate is cumbersome to use, particularly in the field. The subject invention overcomes the foregoing shortcomings of the prior art shoes having replaceable sole plates by providing a sole having a thin cavity which releasably receives a sole plate which substantially fills the cavity. The sidewall of the cavity includes flaps which are contiguous with the bottom surface of the sidewall and have a thickness which is less than the thickness of the cavity. Depressions located in the outer surface of the sole plate are arranged to receive the flaps when the sole plate is pushed past the flaps into the cavity. The flaps then hold the sole plate in the cavity. In another aspect of the invention, a slot is located in the sidewall of the cavity at the toe end of the shoe and the sole plate has a tab at its front end which fits into the slot. In this embodiment the sidewall includes a ledge which extends into the cavity below the slot and the sole plate has a recess which is located below the tab and receives the ledge. Thus, when the sole plate is placed in the cavity the ledge and recess interfit to prevent sand from getting under the tab.

    "abstract": "This invention relates to a novel method for increasing fertility in males with impairment of testosterone synthesis by injecting slow-release microcapsules or microspheres containing testosterone directly into infertile testes to stimulate Leydig cells. 2. Prior Art Approximately 5 percent of American couples are infertile due to male infertility alone (approximately 2.5 million men), and 75 percent of these males have pathologies associated with low testosterone output by the testes (approximately 1.9 million men). Direct testicular injection of slow-release testosterone encapsulations could be efficacious in increasing the fertility of many of these men. No thought has apparently been given to the method of using testosterone-laden microspheres for fertility enhancement rather than fertility reduction. Testosterone is required for spermatogenesis. Normally, the Leydig cells of the testes secrete testosterone directly into the testicle interstitial fluid and maintain the locally high testosterone concentration required for the maintenance of robust spermatogenesis. In some males, this fails to occur. Leydig cells either fail to produce testosterone at all, or fail to secrete it in sufficient amounts to maintain normal spermatogenesis. Microcapsulation of bioactive compounds (primarily steroid hormones) has been performed for almost ten years. The microcapsulation process itself is covered by U.S. Pat. No. 4,489,330. Beck et al first reported the use of biodegradable microspheres for the encapsulation of a steroid hormone and the intramuscular injection of those microspheres as a long-acting method for the slow-release of norethisterone into the bloodstream (Beck et al., &#34;New Long-Lasting Injectable Microcapsule Contraceptive System&#34;, J. OBSTET. GYN., 135:419-426 (1979)). The concept was to provide a method of long-term steroid delivery for women for purposes of contraception. This work has been followed up by studies which examine the efficiency of this contraceptive delivered to human females (Beck et al., &#34;Clinical Evaluation of Injectable Biodegradable Contraceptive System&#34;, AM. J. OBSTET. GYNEC., 140:799-806 (1981); Beck et al., &#34;Clinical Evaluation of and Improved Injectable Microcapsule Contraceptive System&#34;, AM. J. OBSTET. GYNEC, 147:815-821 (1983); Rivera et al., &#34;Norethisterone Microspheres Six-Month System: Clinical Results&#34;, Long-Acting Contraceptive Delivery Systems, Harper and Row (1984)). Since at least 1980 there has been work on the encapsulation of other hormones in biodegradable microspheres, and in 1986 a method was disclosed for the manufacture of testosterone--containing biodegradable microspheres (Lewis et al., &#34;Overview of Controlled Release Systems of Male Contraception&#34; and Asch et al., &#34;Preliminary Results on the of Testosterone Microcapsules&#34;, Male Contraception: Advances and Future Prospects, Harper and Row (1986)). These were developed with the thought of using such microspheres in applications towards male contraception or virilizing males with hypopituitary or hypogonadal function. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention injects directly into the testes small volumes of testosterone-laden microspheres or microcapsules which can act as temporary Leydig cells. These microspheres or microcapsules can release the testosterone directly into the testicular parenchyma which would bypass the need to regulate pituitary function or peripheral testosterone concentrations and maintain the high intratesticular concentrations of testosterone needed for spermatogenesis. Under this method, a small percutaneous injection of slow-release microspheres would maintain high intratesticular testosterone concentration for a long enough period of time to allow more than one spermatogenic cycle. This treatment has the advantage of simplicity, requires no surgery, can be performed on an outpatient basis, requires no follow-up action by the patient, is self-reversing, and can be used multiple times in the same patient. These and other and further objects and features of the invention are apparent in the disclosure, which includes the above and ongoing specification with the claims.",

No. 6,117,463 issued Sep. 12, 2000, to Alexander et al. for a “Process for Preparing Battered Foods”. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A taquito is an ethnic food item generally of Mexican origin but which is modified to the taste and liking of non-ethnic people. It comprises a flour tortilla rolled into a generally cylindrical shape that can be filled with any of a variety of fillings. Typical fillings include, but are not limited to, ground or shredded meat or poultry, cheese, vegetables, sweet flavors, and the like. A process for making taquitos results in a product comprising a filled tortilla having a fried coating selected from the group consisting of a diluted hydrocolloid, and a mixture of water and flour. To reconstitute the taquito, the frozen taquito may be subjected to microwave heating without thawing. Alternatively, the frozen taquito may be heated with or without thawing in a conventional oven; however, the crispy characteristic of this invention is most preferably attained with the microwave heating method. To prepare the frozen taquito, tortilla dough is separated into portion-sized generally circular disks using a dough cutting, press or stamping system, preferably a cutting system, and most preferably a die-cut system. A selected filling is deposited on a flattened disk near the center but offset from a diameter and from the peripheral edge. Then as much half the peripheral edge portion of the tortilla may receive an edible adhesive. To shape the taquito, a portion of the tortilla edge is folded over the filling and tucked under the filling. Next, the tortilla is rolled to obtain a generally cylindrical shape so that, when applied, the edible adhesive holds the tortilla in the generally cylindrical shape. After applying a coating of, for example, a diluted hydrocolloid, the product is fried to make the coated taquito. Then the coated taquito is frozen and packaged.",

    "abstract": "A tubular article useful in prosthetic surgery has been invented. The article has a plurality of fibers manufactured from an absorbable polymer. The polymer comprises at least one trimethylene carbonate linkage. In one embodiment, the absorbable polymer is a copolymer. In another embodiment, the article is manufactured on a warp knitting machine. The absorbable polymer comprises more than about 50% by weight of the article. The remainder of the article, if any, comprises a plurality of fibers manufactured from a nonabsorbable polymer. Another embodiment is an article manufactured on a weft knitting machine. The absorbable polymer comprises more than about 50% by weight of the article. The remainder of the article, if any, comprises a plurality of fibers manufactured from a nonabsorbable polymer. Yet another embodiment is a woven article. The absorbable polymer in the warp and weft yarns comprises more than about 50% by weight of the article. The remainder, if any, comprises a plurality of fibers manufactured from a nonabsorbable polymer. A generic embodiment of all of the above is a tubular article comprising a vascular graft. A vascular graft has also been invented. The vascular graft has a plurality of fibers which are manufactured from an absorbable copolymer. The copolymer comprises up to about 50% by weight of trimethylene carbonate linkages. The copolymer in the MAXON™ (American Cyanamid Company, N.J., U.S.A.) suture contains a copolymer having trimethylene carbonate linkages. MAXON™, which is a poly(glycolide- co-trimethylene carbonate), has superior and unexpected properties when contrasted to other absorbable fibers. It is long-lasting. A portion of its original strength is retained out to 56 days; 50% of the strength remains through 28 days. The absorption rate of MAXON™ is approximately equal to PGA. A MAXON™ fiber is more compliant than polyglycolic acid (herein PGA). A graft containing 75% MAXON™ in combination with Dacron™ has a measured compliance of 3.03. A similarly constructed PGA/Dacron™ graft has a compliance of 2.45. Compliance is measured as a percentage of diametral change per 100 mm Hg internal pressure change. Finally, the bending modulus of MAXON™ is approximately 325,000 p.s.i., indicating that MAXON™ is a much more flexible fiber than other absorbable fibers. In one embodiment, the copolymer comprises about 50% by weight of glycolic acid ester linkages. In another embodiment, the copolymer consists of at least one glycolic or lactic acid ester linkage. Another embodiment is a graft which is manufactured on a warp knitting machine. The absorbable polymer comprises more than about 50% by weight of the article. The remainder, if any, comprises a plurality of fibers manufactured from a nonabsorbable polymer. In a specific embodiment, the graft is manufactured on a Raschel knitting machine. In another specific embodiment, the plurality of nonabsorbable polymer fibers of the graft comprises about 20 to 35% by weight of the graft. In a more specific embodiment, the plurality of absorbable and nonabsorbable fibers are separately texturized by either a false twist or a knit/deknit process. In a most specific embodiment, the nonabsorbable polymer is Hytrel®. Another most specific embodiment is wherein the nonabsorbable polymer is polyethylene terephthalate. Hytrel™ is a trademark of E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., Wilmington, Del. U.S.A. for a class of polymers having the following generic formula: ##STR1## The values for a, x and y are known from the prior art, e.g. as disclosed in &#34;Thermoplastic Copolyester Elastomers: New Polymers For Specific End-Use Applications&#34;, M. Brown, Rubber Industry 9 102-106 (1978), and the references (footnote numbers 1b, 1c, 1d, 2 and 3) cited therein; Encyclopedia of Polymer Science and Technology, Supplement, 2 485-510, see particularly pages 486 to 493, Interscience N.Y. 1977; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,314,561 issued Feb. 9, 1982. All of this prior art is incorporated herein by reference. A specific embodiment of Hytrel® which is useful in this invention is a grade of Hytrel® having a 72 durometer D hard. The polymer in the Novafil™ (American Cyanamid Company, N.J., U.S.A.) suture contains Hytrel®. Novafil™, which is a polybutester, has superior and unexpected properties when contrasted to other nonabsorbable fibers. It is more flexible than other convention-al-type graft fibers, e.g. Dacron™. Novafil™ has a bending modulus of approximately 230,000 p.s.i. Also, the compliance of a Novafil™ containing graft measures 4.20 in combination with MAXON™. A similar graft manufactured from Dacron™ and Maxon™ has a compliance of 3.03. Compliance is measured as a percentage of diametral change per 100 mm Hg internal pressure change. Finally, a tubular article useful in prosthetic surgery and having a plurality of fibers manufactured from a nonabsorbable polymer has been invented. In a specific embodiment, the nonabsorbable polymer is Hytrel®. A concentric knit relationship, wherein PGA comprises the inner tube, Maxon™ comprises the middle tube, and either Dacron™ or Novafil™ comprises the outer tube, has the following synergistic advantages: (1) Dacron™ is known from the prior art to incite a thrombogenic reaction. (2) Dacron™ or Novafil™ fibers can be shielded from blood by inner layers of PGA and MAXON™, thereby minimizing the tendency to thrombose and occlude the graft. (3) As PGA and then MAXON™ degrade and are absorbed, the inner capsule becomes larger and, hence, has a higher probability of remaining patent in small diameter applications. (4) Based upon animal studies, a PGA- and MAXON™ containing graft tends to have greater patency than a commercial graft material. The concentric relationship can be a plurality of single tubes attached together by sewing, gluing, or merely held together by frictional contact between the layers. The MAXON™ and/or PGA absorbable components of the graft become absorbed and are replaced by natural tissue. This leaves skeletal structure of nonabsorbable Dacron™ or Novafil™ fiber which is encapsulated in healthy collagenous tissue.

    "abstract": "The present invention concerns the administration by injection to patients of liquid compositions for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes. It more particularly concerns a power assisted method and device for controllably dispensing a liquid medicament or diagnostically active contrast agent, the homogeneity of which is preserved throughout delivery. Typically, the contrast agent is an aqueous suspension of gas filled microvesicles, namely microbubbles bounded by a surfactant stabilized gas/liquid interface, or microballoons bounded by a tangible material envelope. Power injectors and mechanically assisted infusion systems for controllably dispensing therapeutically active medications are well known in the art. Typically, such devices include an automatic injector for syringes containing an injectable liquid and a plunger or piston movable within the barrel of the syringe to expel said liquid through a tip thereof and injecting into a patient via a tubing connected to an injecting needle or catheter. For controlling the injections parameters, the plunger is driven by means of an electromechanical arrangement organised to push the plunger at a desired rate, continuously or at chosen intervals, so that the amount of medication is delivered to the patient&#39;s body under strictly determined conditions. For instance, in the case of intravenous dispensing contrast agent formulations for diagnostic purposes (X-ray, MRI or ultrasound), the rate and the mode of injection can be accurately controlled to match the requirements of the imaging methods and detector systems used to investigate the circulation or a specific organ in the body. Typical automated injection devices are illustrated and described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,176,646 incorporated herein by reference. Although the automated injectors known are highly sophisticated instruments capable of mastering most injection problems experienced in practice, there remains at least one variable factor not yet under control. Indeed the known power injectors have no control of the homogeneity of the liquid stored within the syringe barrel during the course of its application. This kind of problem is of course non-existent with “true solutions” (i.e. solutions to the molecular level) since in this case no concentration change can occur in the course of time; it however may become important when the injectable formulation is a suspension or dispersion of active particles which tend to settle, coalesce or segregate with time in the syringe. Indeed, even some modest separation of the particles by gravity or otherwise from the carrier liquid in the course of administration of the formulation may have very important influence on reproducibility and reliability of the tests. Hence, in this case, a method and means to keep the syringe content homogeneous during injection is highly desirable. The present method and device constitute a very effective solution to the aforediscussed problem. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Briefly stated, in order to secure homogeneity of a liquid suspension of particles within the barrel of an injector device, the invention provides a method and means whereby the particles are kept under sufficient agitation so as not to settle, segregate or agglomerate in the carrier liquid. This may involve acting on the carrier liquid itself, i.e. on the bulk of the suspension, or may involve acting only on the particles (in this case, one would expect the moving particles to impart motion to the carrier liquid by viscous friction). The agitation means may be provided within the syringe or in some cases outside thereof; for instance with magnetic particles, the particles can be subjected to an external variable magnetic field, the oscillation or rotation of which will set them into motion, the moving particles then acting on the carrier liquid and keeping the suspension homogeneous. In the case of particles not sensitive to external fields, mechanical agitation is provided to the extent that it is sufficient to keep the suspension homogeneous but insufficient to break or damage the particles or disturb their distribution. For this, the syringe barrel may be subjected to motion, said motion being continuous or discontinuous, regular or irregular; the motion can possibly have a shaking, rocking or oscillating effect on the syringe. The frequency, intensity and rate of the motion is such that it will not interfere with the control of delivery parameters of the suspension. The embodiments disclosed below in connection with the annexed drawings provides very effective means to keep the syringe content under sufficient agitation to secure injection of a homogeneous therapeutic or diagnostic liquid compositions into a patient.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to bibs, and more particularly to a disposable bib having articles contained therein for use in feeding a person who is wearing the bib. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION When a parent (or a caregiver) intends to take an infant away from home during a time period in which it will be necessary to feed the infant, the parent must not only remember to pack food for the infant to eat, but the parent must also pack a bib to prevent the infant&#39;s clothes from becoming stained, utensils to provide the food to the infant, and napkins or towelettes for cleaning the infant&#39;s face and hands after the meal. If the parent is distracted or hurried when leaving home, one or more of the aforementioned items may be forgotten. The parent normally realizes that an item for use in feeding the infant has been forgotten only when the parent is preparing to feed the infant. If food is forgotten, an adequate substitute can usually be obtained at an eating establishment, grocery store or convenience store. However, when either a bib, utensil or towelette is forgotten, it is typically difficult to locate a store to purchase an adequate substitute. Therefore substantial time can be expended in an attempt to locate a store when the infant should instead be fed. Even if a store is located by the parent, inexpensive, temporary substitutes are not usually available. Therefore, a relatively significant expenditure may be required even though an item similar to the one being purchased is already owned by the parent and the purchased item is only to serve as a temporary substitute for the forgotten item. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention overcomes the described drawbacks and provides a new and unique arrangement which has the capacity to provide a disposable bib including utensils and towelettes incorporated therein such that a parent need only remember to bring the bib which substantially reduces the likelihood that the items necessary to feed an infant will be forgotten. In accordance with one form of the present invention, the disposable bib arrangement includes a panel adapted to overlie a chest region of a wearer having a first surface designed to face outwardly from the wearer, a second surface designed to face toward the wearer, and a compartment formed on or within the second surface of the panel for containing at least one of an eating utensil and a towelette therein. In accordance with another form of the present invention, a combination includes a disposable bib comprising a panel adapted to overlie a chest region of a wearer having a first surface designed to face outwardly from the wearer, a second surface designed to face toward the wearer, and a compartment formed on or within one of the first and second surfaces of the panel. The combination also includes at least one of an eating utensil and a towelette. In accordance with another form of the present invention, a method of disposing of a disposable bib includes the steps of providing a disposable bib including a panel adapted to overlie the chest region of a wearer having a first surface designed to face outwardly from the wearer, a second surface designed to face toward the wearer, and a compartment formed on or within the second surface of the panel for containing at least one of an eating utensil and a towelette therein. The method also includes the steps of providing the compartment in an inside-out orientation, and inserting the disposable bib in the inside-out oriented compartment. In accordance with another form of the present invention, a method of feeding a person using a disposable bib including a panel adapted to overlie a chest region of the person having a first surface designed to face outwardly from the person, a second surface designed to face toward the person, and a compartment formed on or within the second surface of the panel for containing an eating utensil therein includes the steps of removing the eating utensil from the first compartment of the disposable bib, securing the disposable bib about a person&#39;s neck such that the panel overlies the chest region of the person, utilizing the eating utensil removed from the disposable bib to provide food to the person, and removing the disposable bib from the person&#39;s neck.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to luminal implants, and, more particularly, to stents for use in treating vascular disease. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Stents are widely used for supporting a lumen structure in a patient&#39;s body. For example, a stent may be used to maintain patency of a coronary artery, other blood vessel or other body lumen such as the ureter, urethra, bronchus, esophagus, or other passage. A stent is typically a metal, tubular structure, although polymer stents are known. Stents can be permanent enduring implants, or can be bioabsorbable at least in part. Bioabsorbable stents can be polymeric, bio-polymeric, ceramic, bio-ceramic, or metallic, and may elute over time substances such as drugs. In certain stent designs, the stent is an open-celled tube that is expanded by an inflatable balloon at the deployment site. Another type of stent is of a “self-expanding” type. A self-expanding stent does not use a balloon or other source of force to move from a collapsed state to an expanded state. A self-expanding stent is passed through the body lumen in a collapsed state. At the point of an obstruction, or other deployment site in the body lumen, the stent is expanded to its expanded diameter for its intended purpose. An example of a self-expanding stent is a coil structure that is secured to a stent delivery device under tension in a collapsed state. At the deployment site, the coil is released so that the coil can expand to its enlarged diameter. Coil stents can be manufactured using a variety of methods, such as winding of wire, ribbon, or sheet on a mandrel or by laser cutting from a tube, followed by the appropriate heat treatments. Another type of self expanding stent is an open-celled tube made from a self-expanding material, for example, the Protégé GPS stent from ev3, Inc. of Plymouth, Minn. Open cell tube stents are commonly made by laser cutting of tubes, or cutting patterns into sheets followed by or preceded by welding the sheet into a tube shape, and other methods. The shape, length and other characteristics of a stent are typically chosen based on the location in which the stent will be deployed. However, selected segments of the human vasculature present specific challenges due to their shape and configuration. One such situation involves the ostium of short renal arteries within the human body. Conventional stents are generally designed for segments of long cylindrical vessels. When such stents are deployed at the ostium of short renal arteries, in an attempt to prevent further progression of arteriosclerotic disease from the aorta into the renal arteries, they may extend into the aorta and disrupt the normally laminar blood flow. This result further compounds an existing need to minimize disruption of the flow pattern at the ostium. In addition, stents are hard to position on a consistent basis at the precise ostial location desired, and placement of renal stents can release arteriosclerotic debris from the treatment area. Such debris can flow distally into the kidney and embolize, causing impaired renal function. Accordingly, it is desirable to flare the end of a stent to minimize disruption to flow patterns at an ostium and to not create barriers to future access by interventional devices. However, existing stents are hard to flare with existing expansion means. Stents suitable for expansion of renal arteries must have high radial strength when expanded to resist vessel forces tending to radially collapse the stent. This need for high stent strength makes suitable stents difficult to flare at the ostium. A stent configuration designed to address these concerns is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/816, 784, filed Apr. 2, 2004, by Paul J. Thompson and Roy K. Greenberg, US Publication Number U.S. 2004/0254627 A1. However, this stent, when flared, has a lower percentage of stent strut coverage of vessel wall at flared regions than is desirable. It is known that stent struts, when expanded into contact with the vessel wall, should cover a certain percentage of the internal vessel wall area in order to prevent prolapse of tissue through the open spaces between stent struts. Accordingly, a need exists for a stent that can be placed at the renal ostium which is both strong and provides a high percentage of vessel wall coverage. Further need exists for a stent that will minimize disruption of the flow pattern at the ostium and which will lower the risk of embolization during deployment. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A renal stent comprises a substantially cylindrical segment which is deployed in the renal vessel and a flared segment which is deployed in ostial and aortic regions of the vessel. The substantially cylindrical segment provides superior radial strength for maintaining dilated diameter of the renal vessel. The flared segment, which is formed by a plurality of slits extending through the sidewall of the stent, expands to conform to the ostial and aortic regions of the vessel. The flared segment can be balloon dilated to enhance conformance of the flared stented segment to the ostial and aortic regions. A stent delivery system capable of delivering and deploying the substantially cylindrical segment and the flared segment is also provided. According to a first aspect of the disclosure, a medical device for insertion into a body lumen comprises a tubular body having a length extending along an axis between first and second ends thereof. The tubular body has a sidewall with a plurality of slits extending therethrough from the first end toward the second end. The plurality of slits extend less than the length of the tubular body and define a plurality of sidewall segments having different radial expansion characteristics, relative to the axis, than non-slitted portions of the tubular body. A plurality of radiopaque markers are disposed at the second end of the tubular body and have a defined relationship to the number and position of the plurality of slits. According to a second aspect of the disclosure, a medical device for insertion into a body vessel comprises a first tubular section having a length extending along an axis between first and second ends thereof. The first tubular section has a sidewall with a plurality of slits extending through the sidewall for less than the length thereof from the first end toward the second end. A second tubular section extends along the axis and is also radially expandable. A mechanism joins the second end of the first tubular section, proximal of said plurality of slits, to the second tubular section. The first tubular section has different radial expansion characteristics, relative to the axis, than the second tubular section. In one embodiment, the first tubular section is self expanding while the second tubular section may be balloon expandable.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to earth-working equipment, such as an agricultural implement pulled by a tractor, and more particularly to a method for controlling a hydraulic system that operates a hitch that couples the agricultural implement to the tractor. 2. Description of the Related Art A variety of agricultural implements are available to be pulled by a tractor for working earth in a farm field in which crops will be or have been planted. The implement is connected to a standard three-point hitch with right and left drag links on the rear of the tractor and the hitch can be operated to raise and lower the implement. The hitch is hydraulically driven by a system that typically provides one or both of position control and draft or load control. The position control maintains the implement at a constant working depth in spite of differences in soil conditions. When employing solely position control, an operator input device is set to establish a desired vertical position of the three-point hitch with respect to a geometric plane established by the tractor. The operator input device sends a command signal to the hydraulic system to either raise or lower the hitch. A position feedback system senses the actual hitch position and stops the raising or lowering once the desired position is reached. This position is maintained by the control system until manually changed by the operator. A problem with maintaining a fixed position of the implement is that hard soil or an obstruction can exert such a large force that the tractor engine stalls. Draft control raises and lowers the hitch during plowing so that the draft force that the implement exerts on the hitch remains constant, despite irregularities in the soil. Thus the draft control enables the working implement to operate effectively without stalling of the tractor engine even in the presence of obstacles such as stones. A tractor employing only draft control has a force sensor connected with the hydraulic system that elevates or lowers the implement hitch. This mechanism raises the hitch as the draft force increases and lowers the hitch as the draft force decreases. An operator input device establishes one or more parameters, such as the force threshold that must occur before the implement is raised of lowered. In certain situations, each of these control techniques alone is not entirely satisfactory. Thus, some previous control systems employed both position and draft control. In that case, the position of the hitch is raised and lowered in response to changes in the sensed draft force, but the position is held within a range set by operator defined upper and lower threshold positions. The threshold range expands and contracts based on a draft setting provided by the operator. As the draft force increases, the hitch begins to rise until the upper threshold position is reached or until the draft force decreases. As the force decreases, the hitch lowers until the lower threshold position is reached or until the draft force increases. The operator draft setting is influenced by a number of factors, including type of implement, commanded depth, soil composition, and soil moisture content. There often is no correlation between the operator setting and the specific position and draft force. These factors make the operator draft setting a trial and error proposition. Another concern relates to adverse control effects that result from lateral forces acting on the implement. Some implements act to roll soil toward one side of the vehicle creating a load with a resultant force vector oriented at a significant angle away from the direction of vehicle travel. A hitch with right and left drag links observes this type of loading as positive load force on one drag link and negative load force on the opposite drag link. If these load forces are sensed and merely averaged, the control system does not recognize a change in loading and does not respond to changes in draft load, or operates at a significantly reduced level of sensitivity to these loading conditions. As a consequence, there is a need for a hydraulic control system that provides an enhanced combination of position and draft control. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A vehicle has a hitch for towing an implement that can be raised and lowered by movement of the hitch. The hitch is moved by operating a valve to control the flow of fluid to and from a hydraulic actuator which is mechanically coupled to the hitch. A method for controlling a hitch comprises defining a draft setpoint that specifies an amount draft force desired to be exerted on the hitch. During operation of the vehicle a first draft force acting on one side of the hitch is sensed and a second draft force acting on another side of the hitch is sensed. A draft load is derived as a function of a greater one of the first draft force and the second draft force and a difference between the first and second draft forces. The draft load and the draft setpoint then are employed to produce a draft force error. For example, the draft force error is based on the difference between the draft load and the draft setpoint. The valve is operated in response to the draft force error to selectively raise and lower the hitch and thus the implement attached to the hitch. Another aspect of the present method involves defining a draft force setpoint in response to actual operating conditions encountered by the vehicle while pulling an implement through specific soil conditions. At that time, a first plurality of samples of the first draft force and a second plurality of samples the second draft force are sensed. For example the first and second draft force may be sensed on opposite lateral sides of the hitch. Then, a first average of the first plurality of samples and a second average of the second plurality of samples are calculated. The draft setpoint is derived as a function of a greater one of the first average and the second average and a difference between those averages. In a particular embodiment of the present method deriving the draft setpoint involves adding the greater one of the first average and the second average to a term based on an absolute value of the difference between the first and second averages. During subsequent operation of the vehicle, the draft load is similarly derived by adding the greater of the first draft force and the second draft force to a term based on an absolute value of the difference between the first and second draft forces. Another aspect of the present method derates the draft force and the resultant error value as the hitch approaches a limit of its possible motion. For example, there is a upper position beyond which the hitch cannot be physically raised. The control system also defines an upper threshold position above which the hitch is not desired to move while working a particular farm field. Draft forces acting on the hitch may cause the control system to raise the hitch above the upper threshold position, in which event the draft load is reduced proportionally. In particular, the draft load is reduced, derated, based on a first relationship between the actual position of the hitch and the upper limit position, and in response to a second relationship between the threshold position and the upper limit position. For example, a first difference between the actual hitch position and the upper limit position, and a second difference between the upper threshold position and the upper limit position are calculated. The draft load is multiplied by a ratio of the first difference to the second difference and the product becomes a new draft load value that is used to determine the draft force error.",

    "abstract": "The present invention generally relates to a novel strategy for treatment of disorders associated with elevated pulmonary venous pressure involving implanting, in a subject, one or more endoprosthesis (“valve”), preferably in or at the ostia of a pulmonary vein(s). It is an object of this invention to provide for methods and devices which lower mean pulmonary venous pressure, and thereby treat conditions such as congestive heart failure (“CHF”), by creating an effective unidirectional partitioning between the left atrium and one or more of the four pulmonary veins. The present invention provides for expandable as well as fixed-dimension prosthetic valves for implantation in or at the pulmonary veins of appropriately selected patients with existing, impending or probable CHF. The prosthetic valves of the invention, in their properly implanted condition, configuration and orientation, are capable of permitting ingress of blood from the pulmonary vein(s) into the left atrium during that portion of the cardiac cycle when the pressure in the pulmonary vein(s) slightly exceeds the pressure in the left atrium, and are capable of preventing egress of blood from the left atrium into the pulmonary vein(s) during that portion of the cardiac cycle when the pressure in the left atrium slightly exceeds the pressure in the pulmonary vein(s). In further embodiments,the present invention relates to particular species of expandable prosthetic pulmonary valves, to said valves comprised in delivery systems, and to strategies for percutaneous or surgical delivery, placement and implantation of said valves. Specific examples include the diaphragm, trapdoor, stocking and windsock valves illustrated in FIGS. 1-4, respectively. In preferred embodiments of the invention, pulmonary vein prosthetic valves, when implanted in one or more pulmonary vein(s), are intended to relieve or eliminate CHF due to mitral valve regurgitation and/or left ventricular non-compliance. In patients with CHF with abnormally high mean pulmonary venous pressure due to defective systolic partitioning between the left ventricle and the pulmonary veins largely or partially secondary to mitral regurgitation, who are deemed unsuitable for mitral valve replacement, implantation of prosthetic pulmonary vein valves may be used to lower mean pulmonary venous pressure by restoring effective systolic partitioning between relatively high left ventricular and left atrial systolic pressure, and pulmonary veins. In patients with CHF largely or partially due to left ventricular diastolic dysfunction or mitral stenosis, with abnormally high mean pulmonary venous pressure due to natural lack of diastolic partitioning between the left atrium and pulmonary veins, implantation of the prosthetic pulmonary vein valves may be used to lower mean pulmonary venous pressure by creating effective diastolic partitioning between relatively high left atrial diastolic pressure and the pulmonary vein(s).",

    "abstract": "The present invention involves the use of a unique polymer for thickening hair treatment formulations. This material forms a stable fluid emulsion when maintained in aqueous solution or added to hydrogen peroxide. The formulation does not thicken until addition of an alkaline dye lotion immediately before application to the hair. Where a peroxide solution is employed, it is very important that the peroxide solution remain in a thin, fluid emulsion until mixed with the dye lotion to enable easy pouring and mixing. It has now been discovered that .[.polymers of an ester of a C 16  to C 22  carboxylic acid and a polyalkylene glycol ether of a C 16  to C 22  alcohol and two or more monomers of C 16  to C 22  carboxylic acids or their esters are surprisingly stable to hydrogen peroxide and form thin emulsions therewith. Of these compounds it is most preferred to employ acrylates/steareth 20 methacrylate copolymer, [the nomenclature of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association (CFTA), Cosmetic Ingredient Dictionary, Third Edtion Supplement, 1985] such as sold by Rohm &amp; Haas, Philadelphia, Pa. as a cosmetic thickener under the trade name Acrysol-ICS. It was discovered.]. that .Iadd.Acrysol ICS is most stable to hydrogen peroxide and forms a thin emulsion therewith at a neutral or acid pH. .Iaddend.Acrysol ICS is most surprisingly stable to hydrogen peroxide and forms a thin emulsion therewith at neutral or acid pH. .Iadd.Acrysol ICS is sold by Rohm &amp; Haas, Philadelphia, Pa. .Iaddend.This copolymer is a polymer of an ester of methacrylic acid steareth 20 and two or more monomers consisting of acrylic acid, methacrylic acid or their simple esters. When a solution of Acrysol ICS is treated with an aqueous ammonia solution, having an alkaline pH in the range range normally associated with oxidation dyeing, and containing dyestuff precursors, the resulting mixture has a thickened viscosity which is suitable for hair dyeing. Very highly aqueous dye systems are very desirable. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The use of Acrysol-ICS is a key ingredient of the developer part of this invention when used in oxidative hair dye compositions. It is described as forming a thin emulsion at neutral or acid pH which thickens or neutralization above pH 7. Acrysol-ICS when added to hydrogen peroxide is suprisingly stable. When a solution of hydrogen peroxide containing at least 3% active Acrysol-ICS is brought to a pH which is within the alkaline pH range used in hair dyeing, by the addition of an alkalizer such as ammonia or alkanolamine, the resulting mixture has a thickened viscosity which is suitable for dyeing purposes. No organic surfactant or solvent need be present, although in practice some small amounts of surfactants or solvents would probably be needed to help dissolve the dyes and provide foaming and conditioning. Very highly aqueous oxidation dye systems are very desirable. The oxidation hair dye bases of the present invention whose compositions are given below contain only about 5% organic solvents and surfactants as compared with 50% or more in current products. There are a number of advantages of such high water content dye systems. Aside from the obvious cost saving, it was found that dyeing is much more efficient when solvents and surfactants are kept to a minimum; about one half as much dye is needed to produce the same shade as in current products. Also, it is likely that there will be less skin and scalp staining by dye in a more highly aqueous system, partly because the low concentration of surfactants washes away less of the protective oil in the skin. Furthermore, the thickened solution is quite thixotropic, spreading easily into the hair but showing excellent &#34;stay-put&#34; quality when the shear is removed. Adding of about 1% based on the hair dye composition of an aqueous solution of Acryol-ICS to the developer prior to mixing the lotion and the developer, enables the tailoring of the viscosity of the ultimate hair dyeing composition. Thus, for example, a hair dresser can add Acrysol-ICS to a more fluid hair dye composition suitable for use by a consumer and thus make it sufficiently viscous e.g. for root dyeing that is known to require a condsiderbly more viscous dye composition. Although developer formulations containing Acrysol-ICS and hydrogen peroxide are surprisingly stable, it is sometimes advantageous to add known stabilizers for peroxide to the formulations to counteract the effect of impurities which could catalyze peroxide decomposition. Examples of substances which are known to stabilize hydrogen peroxide are phenacetin, EDTA and other substances which complex heavy metal ions such as are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,378,444 and 3,632,295.

    "abstract": "This invention relates to the field of human dietary supplements, and more specifically to improved supplements comprising organochromium complexes derived from yeast. The physiological assimilation of an adequate quantity of heavy metals is essential to human health. Failure to ingest and absorb the necessary amounts of such metals can lead to improper functioning of the body&#39;s metabolic processes, and to various diseases and disorders. In particular, chromium deficiency can be a major problem in the human diet. Inadequate intake of chromium has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, hypoglycemia, obesity, impaired metabolism, and diminished longevity. Heart disease and diabetes alone account for about sixty percent of all deaths in the United States each year, and death usually strikes these victims ten to twenty years before they reach the average life span. The National Academy of Sciences has recommended an intake for humans of about 50 to 200 micrograms of trivalent chromium daily. It has been reported that about 9 out of 10 adults fail to ingest even the minimum recommended amount. Trivalent chromium (Cr 3+ ) describes the charged state of chromium species present in foods and, thus, supplementation with Cr 3+  is useful in dietary supplements. Other forms of chromium, such as Cr 4+  and Cr 6+ , are quite toxic and are not useful in supplementing the human diet. Trivalent chromium may be complexed to organic or inorganic ligands, forming organic and inorganic forms of trivalent chromium respectively. Both organic and inorganic forms of chromium have been used as dietary supplements. Biological activity of chromium is highly dependent upon the type of coordinate complex formed with the chromium. A chromium coordinate complex is formed when an organic ligand is bound to trivalent chromium in a configuration that involves both covalent/ionic and non-covalent forces to stabilize the complex. The biological activity of a complex depends upon its bioavailability. Inorganic chromium compounds have been shown to have much less bioavailability than organic coordination compounds. [M. M. Wang et al.,  Nutr. Res.,  9:989-998 (1989)]. A possible explanation is that since organic chromium complexes have greater membrane solubility than their inorganic counterparts, organic complexes have better bioavailability and, hence, have higher biological activity. One of the major nutritional roles of trivalent chromium appears to be its effect in glucose metabolism. Specifically, a deficiency in chromium in the diet has been linked to impaired glucose tolerance, i.e., reduced ability to maintain blood glucose at normal levels. The transport of glucose and vital amino acids into the cell for energy and protein synthesis is facilitated by the binding of insulin, which is an important hormone for the human system since it is involved in the control of muscle growth, body weight, cardiovascular health and many other vital metabolic functions. Mertz has shown that an organic trivalent chromium complex called Glucose Tolerance Factor (“GTF”) is responsible for binding insulin to cell membrane insulin receptor sites. [Mertz, W., “Chromium Occurrence and Function in Biological Systems,”  Physiol. Rev.,  49:163-239 (1969), “Mertz I”]. The exact structure of active yeast-produced GTF is not well defined. However, chemical analysis of GTF shows that GTF is comprised chiefly of trivalent chromium and niacin, and contains glycine, glutamic acid, and cysteine. [Evans, G. W., et al.,  Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm.,  50:718-722 (1973)]. Hence, chromium having GTF chromium activity is essential to the maintenance of blood glucose levels. 3. Description of Prior Art Since the human diet is frequently deficient in chromium content, dietary supplementation with highly bioavailable, non- toxic chromium agents is desirable. A major shortcoming of using Brewer&#39;s yeast as a source of naturally occurring GTF as supplemental dietary chromium is that the active form of chromium ion is formed in very low concentrations in Brewer&#39;s yeast. As a result, the average human would have to consume at least ten tablespoons of Brewer&#39;s yeast per day in order to get about 40 micrograms of biologically active chromium. Attempts at extracting or concentrating GTF from Brewer&#39;s yeast have been reported as reasonably successful, but the expense of the processing required for producing a commercial food supplement by these methods is prohibitive for the development of a viable commercial product. [Toepfer, E. et al.,  J. Agr. Food Chem.,  21(1): 69-73 (1973) “Toepfer I”]. Thus, inorganic and organic complexes of trivalent chromium have been developed with hopes of providing safe alternative sources of supplemental chromium having similar biological activity to GTF derived from Brewer&#39;s yeast. The prior art provides for dietary chromium which can be used to supplement the diet from two distinct sources: chemical synthesis (of inorganic and organic forms of chromium) or biological processing by yeast (chromium-enriched yeast). Although synthetic inorganic chromium compounds, such as chromium chloride, chromium oxide, and chromium acetate, have been shown to have very low bioavailability, they do show limited activity as dietary supplements. [Anderson, R. and Kozlovsky, A.,  Am. J. Clin. Nut.,  41:1177-1183 (1985); Liu, V. J. K., et al.,  Am. J. Clinical Nutrition,  31:972-976 (1978)]. Unfortunately, these inorganic chromium compounds have also been shown to have appreciable toxicity to the human system. [Mertz, W.,  Newer Trace Elements in Nutrition,  7:123-159 (1971) “Mertz II”]. Trivalent chromium complexed with various organic ligands has been used to adequately supply chromium to the human body. Experiments have shown that some of these chromium complexes are better absorbed and utilized by the body than elemental or inorganic salt forms of chromium. [See, e.g., Evans, U.S. Pat. No. 4,315,927]. However, a major shortcoming of the compounds in which trivalent chromium is complexed with organic ligands, specifically, picolinic acid, is their inherent water insolubility. Such insolubility may hinder the efficacy or absorption of chromium by intestinal membranes, ultimately leading to only a fraction of the chromium being available to effect its nutritionally beneficial actions. Another drawback of using chromium picolinates as dietary supplements is the potential for chromosomal damage when the complexes are introduced into cells. [Brody, J., “Chromosome Damage in the Lab is Tied to a Chromium Supplement,” New York Times, Oct. 25, 1995]. Nicotinate salts of trivalent chromium have also been used for supplementation to the human diet. These chromium nicotinate compounds have demonstrated biological action in some experiments, however, they show decreased activity in some key metabolic assays where the efficiency of chromium metal uptake by the human intestine was investigated. [See, Evans, cited above]. Attempts to obtain compounds with appreciable GTF biological activity have also been made. [Toepfer, et al.,  J. Ag. Food Chem.,  25(l):162-166 (1977) “Toepfer II”]. Toepfer teaches the reaction of nicotinic acid and amino acids with chromium chloride in refluxing alcohol. However, the biological activity of these compounds are marginal, the reflux reaction generates limited yields, and the products are hard to characterize and are of limited stability. A method for synthesizing a trivalent organochromium species comprised of contacting an alkali metal salt of nicotinic acid with a trivalent chromium salt is known. [Jensen, U.S. Pat. No. 4,923,855]. The resulting chromium complex is a form of chromium that is purportedly a useful supplement to the human diet since it has been demonstrated to have GTF activity comparable to Brewer&#39;s yeast. However, this complex has poor solubility. Chromium complexed with various amino acids has also been reported. Certain chelated compounds can be used as feed supplements for animals. [See, e.g., Ashmead, U.S. Pat. No. 4,020,158]. Specific buffer systems have been used to derive ligands for trivalent chromium from hydrolyzed protein concentrates in the production of feed supplements for animals. [See, Jenson, U.S. Pat. No. 4,187,364]. Trivalent chromium complexed with a vitamin ligand, e.g., nicotinic acid and, optionally, an α-amino acid have been prepared. [Ashmead, U.S. Pat. No. 5,292,729]. Such compounds have appreciable biological activity similar to Brewer&#39;s yeast. Most notably, Brewer&#39;s (or Baker&#39;s) yeast also contains active forms of trivalent chromium. The terms Brewer&#39;s and Baker&#39;s yeast are known in the art to refer to the same strain of yeast. It has been shown that Glucose Tolerance Factor (GTF) from Brewer&#39;s yeast is an effective form of chromium that is essential for human metabolism. [See, Mertz  Archives of Biochem. and Biophvs.,  85:292-295 (1959), “Mertz III”]. GTF can be produced by niacin or tryptophan, glycine, glutamic acid and cysteine, as well as a source of chromium, usually inorganic chromium. The trivalent chromium complexes naturally produced in low yields in Brewer&#39;s yeast are known to be highly active. Indeed, the most active source of naturally occurring chromium is found in Brewer&#39;s yeast. [Mertz, W.,  Present Knowledge in Nutrition,  36:365-372 (1976), “Mertz IV”]. Other forms of chromium yeast have been reported. For example, chromium derived from Brewer&#39;s yeast has reported chromium concentrations of about ten to thousand-fold greater than those of Mertz IV (cited above) has been produced. [See, Skorgerson, U.S. Pat. No. 4,348,483]. A method of concentrating organic chromium complex in Brewer&#39;s yeast comprising a nutritional media of chromium oxide, and specific quantities of certain amino acids has been reported. [See, Szalay, U.S. Pat. No. 4,343,905]. These sources of biologically active chromium are obtained by the processing of yeast having an enriched chromium content. It is believed that these processed “chromium yeast” have a much greater concentration of chromium than is naturally occurring in Brewer&#39;s yeast, which is typically about 5 ppm. [Offenbacher, E.,  Am. J. Clinical Nut.,  42:454-461 (1985)]. As reported, these chromium-yeast metabolically process the chromium, thereby producing chromium coordination complexes with high GTF activity. Inorganic forms of chromium have been used as feed for yeast in order to produce these chromium coordination complexes of high GTF activity. For example, a method for producing chromium-enriched yeast (Brewer&#39;s yeast, Torula yeast, or  S. uvarum ) that employs an aqueous solution of inorganic chromium salts such as CrCl 3  with growth media, and with a pregrowth incubation period to cultivate the yeast is known. [Skogerson, U.S. Pat. No. 4,348,483]. Chromium content of the yeast produced using this process is from about 500 ppm to about 1,000 ppm. However, this process entails internalization of the inorganic chromium salt without complete metabolization, resulting in a high probability that a significant amount, if not all, of the chromium found in the chromium-enriched yeast is inorganic chromium. Hence, the chromium produced in this process is not GTF active chromium yeast, but is rather inorganic trivalent chromium salts mixed with the structural material of yeast. As such, the chromium produced using this method does not possess high bioactivity and is also toxic if ingested in high doses. A method is also known for producing Brewer&#39;s yeast having an intracellular chromium concentration of about 200 ppm by cultivating the yeast in a broth where the source of trivalent chromium is from a mixture of chromium oxide and certain amino acids. [Szalay, U.S. Pat. No. 4,343,905]. Although 80% of the chromium produced by this method is reported to be GTF chromium, this method is hard to reproduce due to the insolubility of the chromium oxide. In other words, the insolubility of chromium oxide results in a low yield of GTF chromium produced by this method. To the extent that this method also involves internalization of chromium oxide without its metabolization, it results in inorganic chromium oxide that is merely mixed with the yeast structural material. Since chromium oxide is known to be significantly toxic to the human system, this method is not preferred as a method for making a dietary supplement. There remains a need in the art for concentrated forms of GTF chromium—complexes bearing the structure and activity found in naturally occurring Brewer&#39;s yeast, but having a higher biological activity, and which may be used in high concentrations because of their low toxicity. In addition, there is a need in the art for methods to produce such complexes. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention overcomes the shortcomings of the prior art by providing a method for producing a composition of highly active GTF chromium, where: (1) the chromium source of the present invention is the natural form of active GTF chromium coordination complex; (2) the chromium source is substantially organometallic chromium, completely free of inorganic chromium; (3) the coordination complex of trivalent chromium is substantially metabolizable by the human system; and (4) the process can be carried out efficiently and in a manner that meets requirements important for commercial production.",

II. Background of the Invention and Description of the Prior Art Inflammatory diseases of the skin, such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis, afflict greater than 5% of the population. And the inflammatory disease such as asthma affects more than 10 million people in U.S. alone. Currently, the treatment of these disorders typically involves topical use or inhalation of corticosteroids and bronchodilators. However, these agents also have undesirable side effects such as skin atrophy which limit the duration of therapy. In addition, topical application of a drug is difficult for many patients where the affected area may be very large. Phospholipase A 2  (PLA 2 ) is the common name for phosphatide 2-acylhydrolase which catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sn-2-acyl ester bond of phosphoglycerides and results in production of lysophospholipids and free fatty acids. When the fatty acid is arachidonic acid, further action by cyclooxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase enzymes results in eicosanoid production, which is implicated in inflammation, and leukotrienes which are linked to asthma. Lysophophospholipid metabolism results in production of platelet activating factor and both lysophospholipids and platelet activating factor also play a role in inflammation. PLA 2  enzymes exist as secreted forms (MW˜12,000-15,000) and cytosolic forms (MW˜85,000). The cytosolic or cPLA 2  enzymes appear to play a key role in the pathway leading to the formation of platelet activating factor and the eicosanoids. Inappropriate activation of the cytosolic PLA 2  enzymes, therefore, can result in a variety of chronic and acute conditions including asthma, cerebral ischemia [Clemens et al.,  Stroke , 1996, 27: 527-535], Alzheimer&#39;s Disease [Stephenson et al.,  Neurobiology of Stroke , 1996, 3: 51-63 and see also U.S. Pat. No. 5,478,857], rheumatoid arthritis, neutrophil and platelet activation [Huang et al.,  Mediators of Inflammation , 1994, 3: 307-308], chronic skin inflammation and damage to the skin resulting from exposure to ultraviolet light [Gresham et al.,  American Journal of Physiology , 1996, 270 ; Cell Physiology , 39: C1037-C1050] and macrophage activation [Balsinde et al.,  Journal of Biological Chemistry , 1996, 271: 6758-6765]. Inhibitors of the cPLA 2  enzymes may, therefore, be of use in controlling a wide variety of inflammatory diseases. The literature describes a significant number of compounds said to be phospholipase A 2  inhibitors.

More particularly, the invention relates to antigens consisting of natural protein reproductive hormones, non-hormonal proteins, specific fragments of such hormones and proteins and synthetically derived portions of said hormones and proteins, all modified as will be indicated more fully hereinafter. For the sake of simplicity, hereinafter in this specification and in the claims, these antigens are collectively referred to as modified polypeptides. The invention is directed in one aspect to the use of modified polypeptides in actively immunizing an animal, particularly mammals, against the biological action of endogenous unmodified non-hormonal natural protein and/or hormone. The state of immunity arises because of the creation of antibodies which act against both the antigenic modified polypeptide and its endogenous counterpart which is neutralized (rendered biologically ineffectual) as a result of the existence of said antibodies. The immunity may take place because of the inability of the antibody to distinguish between the modified polypeptide and the naturally existing protein, but it is uncertain that this is in fact the situation. In effect, the invention provides, in one aspect, for the isoimmunization of a primate animal. A more specific aspect of this invention relates to the modification of protein reproductive hormones by adding certain numbers of foreign moieties to each hormone molecule, or hormonal fragment. The modification must be sufficient to cause the body to create antibodies to the modified hormones which will neutralize or inhibit the biological action of the natural hormones produced by the body. Thus, the modified hormones become antigenic and cause the production of antibodies which disrupt the natural processes of conception and/or gestation. The term &#34;protein reproductive hormones&#34; includes those hormones essential to the normal events of the reproductive process. According to a further aspect of this invention, a disease state which can be treated by application of the technique of the instant invention is the digestive disorder known to those skilled in the medical field as the Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome. This syndrome or disease state is generally described as a condition in which a hyper secretion of the polypeptide gastrin, which is produced in the pancreas and brings about a state of hyperacidity in the stomach which results in a chronic digestive disorder. Heretofore, the only effective treatment for this disease state was the surgical removal of a part or total removal of the subject&#39;s stomach. Although survival of such patients is usually not threatened, the medical state and life style of such individuals is severely affected by such treatment. Treatment of such subjects with hapten coupled (produced according to the general method described herein) or otherwise chemically modified gastrin can be used to enhance the production of antibodies against the hypersecretion of gastrin and thereby alleviate or reduce the symptoms of this disease without surgical intervention. Sufficient reduction by immunological means of this substance in the system of the body would be sufficient to avoid the complicated and serious consequences of the surgical treatment currently in use. In practice, an effective amount of modified gastrin is simply injected into the patient as required to accomplish the control of the flow or presence of gastrin. Another serious medical problem which is treatable by the application of the technique of the instant invention is that of hypertension. In general terms, the state of hypertension is the abnormal level or fluctuation of one&#39;s blood pressure. The blood pressure in an individual is controlled by many physiological processes in the body. However, one major substance affecting the regulation of such pressure is the hormonal polypeptide known as angiotension II. In certain states of high blood pressure (hypertension) it is difficult to medically control the secretion and therefore the level of angiotension II in the circulatory system. By the appropriate modification of this hormone and subsequent immunization with this altered modified proteinaceous hormone, it is possible to reduce the secretion of angiotension II in patients with chronically elevated hormone levels. The predictable and controlled reduction of this substance is beneficial to certain patients with chronic problems of hypertension. Modified angiotension II can be produced by the general protein modification technique described herein. The resultant modified angiotension II is simply injected into the patient in an amount sufficient to induce antibody response sufficient to control or regulate unmodified angiotension II to the desired degree. A further embodiment of the present invention is the treatment of diabetes and associated micro and macro vascular diseases. Currently, the treatment of diabetes is limited to dietary and/or drug treatment to regulate blood glucose levels. Recent scientific data support the concept that growth hormone and somatomedian (both polypeptides) are intimately involved in the disease syndrome. These substances can be modified by the technique described herein and used in an effective amount to control the progress of this disease. In practice, modified growth hormone or modified somatomedian is injected into the body to develop antibodies for control of the normally secreted hormones. Another health problem that can be treated by the use of the concepts of this invention is that of certain endocrine or hormone dependent breast tumors or cancers. Certain of these cancers have been shown to be dependent upon the abundant secretion of the hormone prolactin for their continued survival. The inhibition of the secretion of prolactin has been shown to diminish the growth rate and the actual survival of certain of these tumors. The immunization of such subjects with the hapten coupled or otherwise altered prolactin produced as described herein, would result in the systematic reduction of the level of this hormone circulating in the system and consequently, may result in the regression or remission of tumor growth. The consequence of this treatment would be far more favorable in terms of effective treatment of this disease since surgical removal of the breasts is a principal method of treatment currently available. It should be understood that this treatment should be effective for only those tumors that are dependent upon the secretion of prolactin for survival. Investigators also have determined, for example, that certain polypeptide entities are supportive factors to and secretions of neoplastic diseases in both man and other animals. These entities have biochemically, biologically and immunologically close resemblances to hormones, particularly to Chorionic Gonadotropin (CG), as well as to Luteinizing Hormone (LH). By applying the isoimmunization techniques of the invention, the function of such polypeptides or endogenous counterparts can be neutralized to carry out regulation of the malignancy. For example, tumors in both male and female primates may be treated by isoimmunization procedures developing antibodies to Chorionic Gonadotropin or Luteinizing Hormone or the noted entity analogous thereto. Further, neoplasms in primate females may be regulated by isoimmunization procedures developing antibodies to endogenous Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH). This hormone, when associated with a tumor state, tends to aggravate the tumorous condition. The immunochemical control asserted, as noted, neutralizes the naturally occuring hormone or the above-described entity biologically analogous thereto. As a consequence, the hormone or entity will not be available as would normally be the case, for example, the stimulation of some action of a target tissue. Conversely, the neutralization of the biological activity of the hormone or analogous entity may serve to take away an inhibitory action which it otherwise might assert. There are certain other disease states that may be treatable by the use of altered or modified hormonal or non-hormonal proteins as antigens. The disease states and the associated substances that may be used as modified antigens for immunological treatment of these diseases will be listed as follows: (1) modified parathyroid hormone for the treatment of kidney stones, (2) modified insulin and/or glucagon for the treatment of hyperinsulinoma, (3) modified thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) for the treatment of hyperthyroidism, and (4) modified secretin for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Another group of polypeptides which can be altered by the procedures described herein and used in the field of human fertility control are specific non-hormonal protein antigens isolated from placental tissue. There is direct evidence that inhibition of substances that are specific to the placental tissue and do not have similar antigenic properties with other antigens from organs in other parts of the body, can result in the disruption of pregnancies by passive immunization. Such specific placental substances when modified to form modified polypeptides by the procedures described herein can be injected into the body of an animal of the same species as an effective fertility control means with the mechanism being active immunization similar to that described for the antigenic modification of hormones. The particular advantage of these substances is that placental antigens are foreign to the non-pregnant female human subject and therefore are unlikely to cause any cross-reaction or disruption of normal body function in the non-pregnant female. While the invention is useful for the human species it will be appreciated that it is also useful in connection with other animals. Similarly, while the reference herein with respect to fertility control is primarily directed to females, such described techniques may be applicable to males, i.e. FSH, its beta subunit and fragments thereof. Such immunization represents an effective fertility control procedure, providing no physiological consequences are encountered which may be found to react adversely to the performance of other body constituents. Whether the concerned hormone, non-hormonal protein or specific fragment thereof which is modified is naturally occurring or is a synthetic product is clearly immaterial. A synthetic protein molecule will perform the same function as the naturally occurring one, inasmuch as the body will react in an equivalent antigenic manner. It has accordingly been discovered by virtue of this invention that it is possible to interfere with or treat various disease states or medical problems which are caused or influenced by certain polypeptides by active immunization of a male or female animal by the reproduction and use of antigens formed by administration of modified polypeptides. The modification of the polypeptides forms antigens which are than administered into an animal in which immunization is to be developed. Said modification is accomplished by attaching to a polypeptide one or more foreign reactive (modifying) groups and/or by attaching two or more polypeptides to a foreign reactive group (i.e., a carrier) or both of the above, so that the body of the animal, recognizing the modified polypeptide as a foreign object, produces antibodies which neutralize not only the modified protein but also the natural protein which is responsible for the disease or medical problem being regulated. In order to produce an effective quanta of antibodies to the antigen or targeted functional polypeptide, it may be advantageous to administer the modified polypeptide together with an immunological adjuvant. The term &#34;adjuvant&#34; is commonly referred to by those engaged in the field at hand as being a substance which will elevate the total immune response of an animal or person to any immunization thereof, i.e. the adjuvant is a nonspecific immuno-stimulator.",

    "abstract": "The present invention is directed to a toy cash register having a program plate provided with replicas of merchandise thereon and dollar values therefore which will effect control of the operation of the toy cash register in a manner similar to that of a real cash register. 2. Description of the Prior Art Often times toys are made to resemble, at least in appearance, their life sized counterparts. However, in most cases the toys do not very closely simulate or function like the real-life counterpart. This is especially true in such devices as toy cash registers and the like. Known type cash registers in toy configuration have miniature keys and often will permit opening and closing of a cash drawer. However, known type toy cash registers fail to provide or duplicate the many other features of the large actual cash registers which they are designed to resemble. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The pop-up cash register of the present invention closely depicts the operation of an actual cash register. It effects a bell ringing each time a key is depressed, and also provides an increased volume bell ringing action after the sum total of items rung up is reached and the cash drawer is opened. Also, after the sum total is rung up and when the cash drawer is opened by depressing an &#34;OPEN&#34; button, simultaneously therewith a pop-up ejection occurs. In addition, the toy cash register of this invention performs an educational function. Program plates having depicted thereon pictures or replicas of merchandise coordinated with dollar and cent values therefore, together with a total sum of all the items and their money values including programmed channels associated therewith are provided for controlling the operation of the toy register. Thus, a child or other operator of the toy cash register, can actually key-in dollars and cents as indicated on a program plate which has been inserted into the cash register, and this toy/educational device is arranged so that correct values must be inputted to effect operation of the device. That is, if an incorrect value key is depressed, or a number of incorrect keys for a desired sum total are depressed, the device will not funciton, i.e. the values will not be entered. Thus, through sight and sound association, a child can learn correct values of addition while playing with the toy cash register of this invention. A program plate has at least four program channels provided therewith, with two channels along one side of the program plate and two more channels along the other side thereof. Each program channel being provided with obstructions permanently therein to correspond with the pre-printed pictorial matter fastened or applied to the center surface poriton of the program panel between the parallel program channels. A plurality of said program plates are normally provided to enable an operator of the toy cash register a variety of types of merchandise and species thereof to be rung up in the device. A traverse plate is provided for moving under pressure a program plate inserted into a guide channel associated with the device, a spring connected between the traverse plate and a portion of the toy cash register frame, and latching means associated with the program plate to prevent movement thereof until an associated key is depressed. To add interest and excitement to the device, a pop-up feature is also provided. This feature involves forceably ejecting the program plate from the toy after the sum total has been reached and when the OPEN button is depressed for the cash drawer, which then is automatically opened. Simultaneously the totalization bell rings and a &#34;THANK YOU!&#34; appears in view of the operator. Much in the manner of a &#34;Jack-in-the-Box&#34; which always excites young and old, this pop-up ejection of the program plate together with the bell ringing and appearance of the &#34;THANK YOU!&#34; sign in the cash register window creates extra excitement and pleasure for an operator whether child or adult. An object of the present invention is to provide a toy cash register device which simulates an actual cash register in manner of use and operation. A further object of the present invention is to provide a toy cash register device having a plurality of pre-programmed plates for use therewith, each pre-programmed plate having thereon pictures of items of merchandise together with dollar and cent values therefore, together with a sum total of all items depicted on a single panel of the plate. Each plate may have both front and back surfaces provided with the merchandise pictures. Program channels are provided along the edges of the plate for controlling the operation of the cash register device. A still further object of the present invention is to provide a toy cash register which has an educational function in that operation thereof only will occur when correct keys or combination of keys are depressed under the control of a pre-programmed plate depicting items/values of merchandise. Another further object of the present invention is to provide a toy cash register device having a cash drawer which is positively opened by spring structure within the device when a sum total of merchandise has been reached and an OPEN key depressed. Simultaneously with the opening of the cash drawer, a bell rings, and a pre-programmed plate is forceably ejected in a pop-up manner. Then a &#34;THANK YOU!&#34; sign appears in a window of the cash register for easy veiwing by an operator of the device.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to power generation, and more particularly, to methods and devices for generating energy from photovoltaics and temperature differentials. Generators are well known in the art for generating electricity, particularly those known for use in back-up situations for residential homes, commercial buildings, and hospitals. Such devices generally have two-stroke engines that operate on gasoline. The output of such engines is used to turn a generator, which produces electricity. The electricity is fed into the structure and/or supplied to an electrical grid. Such two-stroke engines (and in some applications, 4-stroke engines) are used in many other applications, such as lawn mowers and other outdoor equipment, small tractors, jet-skis and other recreational vehicles. Although, these engines have their advantages, they operate on rather expensive gasoline, significantly contribute to air pollution from their emissions, have many moving parts and are therefore complicated, and are inherently inefficient, expensive, and noisy. Furthermore, power is often required to be transmitted across a rotating joint; such joint can rotate in one, two, or three (spherical) directions. In the prior art, slip rings are used to provide an electrical contact between the moving parts in the rotating joint. Such slip rings are expensive to manufacture and maintain and are prone to failure. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide methods and devices that overcome the disadvantages of the two and four stroke engines of the prior art by providing a cleaner burning, less expensive, less complicated, more environmentally friendly, and more efficient method and device for generating power.

The apparatus can further comprise a secondary material disposed between the heat source and the photovoltaic material and which is heated by the heat source such that the secondary material gives off a visible light that is incident on the photovoltaic material. The secondary material can be heated such that it glows in a spectrum that is most efficient for the photovoltaic material. Still provided is a method for generating power across a rotatable joint where the rotatable joint has first and second rotatable elements rotatably disposed relative to each other.

The apparatus can further comprise cooling means for cooling the second element. The cooling means can comprise a means for circulating air across the second element to produce a hot air byproduct. Where one of the first and second elements has an interior, the interior can be at least partially heated with the hot air byproduct. The apparatus can further comprise a secondary material disposed between the heat source and the photovoltaic means and which is heated by the heat source such that the secondary material gives off a visible light that is incident on the photovoltaic means.

It is completely natural to put weight on the uphill boot so this does not need to be learned when skiing a mono-ski. Interestingly, even expert skiers who have trained their body to put their weight on the downhill ski will automatically correctly put their weight on the uphill boot on the very first turn when switching over to a mono-ski. The beginning skier will also, automatically and without thinking, correctly put their weight on the uphill boot including shifting their weight to the uphill boot during a turn. Balance when standing still is not a problem for even the beginner as the unusually wide forward section of the subject invention mono-ski gives ample sideways platform balance support. Ski pole use is exactly the same for the mono-ski as for dual skis. It is important to note that alpine skiing is a sport which few people beyond forty and hardly any beyond sixty engage in and enjoy. It is the difficulty and effort required to ski dual and existing art mono-skis at an enjoyable and safe skill level that prevents most middle aged and senior skiers from staying with the sport or taking up the sport. The subject invention mono-ski will open up to this group and to all skiers and would be skiers the thrill and exhilaration of alpine skiing that comes when the skier is able to easily execute smooth effortless controlled turns as tight as the skier desires on any slope and regardless of how difficult the snow conditions. A mono-ski for alpine skiing where the skier&#39;s boots are side by side, close together and facing forward and which has an entirely new overall special shape and contour. Different lengths may be made but the relationship of certain dimensions to each other must remain the same as the preferred embodiment. The mono-ski has an unusually wide forward or shovel area which is at least thirty percent or more wider than the narrowest part of the central or waist area. This creates the unusually severe side-cut which allows the mono-ski to be easily turned and without unweighting. It also allows the mono-ski to float easily above or below the surface in light powder snow and to float easily on top of melting snow. Further, it allows the mono-ski to float through deep tracked &#34;crud&#34; conditions and ride over tracked melting snow which has refrozen without being directionally destabilized. Still further, it provides sideways platform stability when the skier is not moving. The rear or tail area of the mono-ski is considerably narrower than the forward or shovel area. This combined with the boots being mounted towards the rear or tail area results in the rear or tail area supporting at least twice the weight per square inch as the forward or shovel area. This gives the mono-ski the capability of running straight when the skier wants to go straight, something hard to do on existing art mono-skis. The forward and rear areas of the mono-ski slope gently upward allowing depth control in deep powder, lowering tail resistance in skidding turns and shortening the forward and rear snow contact points which furthers the capability of the mono-ski to turn easily and without unweighting. It is recommended that the mono-ski be of stiffer than normal construction and have greater than normal camber. This increases the bite into the snow of the severe concave side-cut when the mono-ski is put on edge increasing the mono-ski&#39;s turning force. It also puts more weight on the rear area relative to the forward area, increasing the mono-ski&#39;s capability to run straight when the skier wants to go straight. It is further recommended that a foam core be used, aluminum plates be laminated in the mono-ski to securely hold boot binding screws, the bottom be flat transversely without grooves and a protective metal insert be laminated into the tail of the mono-ski. The same non-stick material, such as polyethylene, should be used on the top surface as on the bottom to prevent snow build-up on the mono-ski. The mono-ski can be made by methods and of materials as are commonly used in the ski industry.",

    "abstract": "It is an object of the present invention to provide a common base for power system components in the dishwasher so that the power system components can be removed and replaced as a single unit. A further object of the invention is to provide a securing mechanism to secure the common base to the dishwasher in a simple and economical fashion. A still further object of the invention is to provide a securing mechanism which is engageable and disengageable without the use of tools. Additional objects of the invention will become apparent from the following description and specification. The present invention overcomes the disadvantages of prior dishwashers by using a common base to mount all of the power components of the dishwasher, thereby permitting the replacement of defective parts without lengthy trouble shooting and fault diagnosis at the installation location which usually is in a user&#39;s home. In addition, the cover for the power component system both secures the base to the dishwasher and isolates the power components inside the dishwasher to prevent accidental contamination or damage to the power components. Further, the cover permits air flow into and out of the power component area for cooling purposes. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, a fill valve, vacuum break, heater, spray pump, drain pump, thermostats, overfill switch, and blower are all mounted on a common base covered by a protective enclosure. This assembly forms an equipment module which can be built as a unit prior to final product assembly. The modular construction allows for easy assembly and field service. The equipment module fits into a specially shaped trough molded into a plastic base of the dishwasher. The module rests on a foam rubber gasket to reduce noise transmission and the escape of water vapor from the trough. The trough serves as a sump for the spray and drain pumps as well as a reservoir for collecting and temporarily storing food soils. The trough is situated along one side of the dishwasher behind the electrical controls compartment. This arrangement reduces the overall height of the unit allowing the product to fit on a kitchen countertop beneath overhead cabinets. The fill valve is connected to a sink faucet by a quick-connect hose assembly. Fresh water flows directly into the drain pump sump region through a vacuum break. The spray pump pulls water through a protective screen located in the bottom of the wash cavity to flow over a thermostatically controlled immersion heater. The spray pump delivers the water from the spray pump outlet through a compression gasket to a hose which hydraulically connects the trough to the spray arm. The compression gasket allows the equipment module to be installed or removed without disturbing hose connections.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to measurement devices for sheet materials, and more particularly, to measurement devices which facilitate the accurate determination of the quantity of carpet which should be delivered to an installation site, such as a home or office. 2. Description of the Prior Art The retail carpet industry has long been plagued with the problem of how to best calculate the quantity of carpet which should be delivered to a particular site for installation. For the purposes of better understanding the critical importance placed on these calculations, the basic operation of the retail carpet industry is described below. When a customer chooses a particular carpet for a home or office, the carpet retailer will usually quote the customer a price based upon the number of square feet of floor which must be covered with carpet. However, it is important to understand that carpet is manufactured and sold to carpet retailers in rolls having a standard width. In the United States, for example, carpet is sold to retailers in rolls having twelve foot widths. Therefore, after the floor plan of the installation site is known, the carpet retailer is faced with the usually difficult task of calculating how many linear feet of carpet to cut from the standard width roll and send to the installation site. The difficulty of this task will be made more apparent below. If the retailer maintains the particular desired carpet in stock, the retailer will then deliver the calculated length of standard width carpet to the installation site. If the retailer does not carry the chosen carpet in stock, or if the retailer does not have the calculated quantity of the chosen carpet in stock, then an order must be placed with the manufacturer for the calculated quantity or an entire roll. In either event, the carpet is then installed at the installation site by employees or contractors of the retailer. If too much carpet is delivered to the installation site, the excess carpet, which usually must be discarded as waste, results in unnecessary expense to the customer. A much more serious situation arises when an insufficient quantity of carpet, called a &#34;short measure&#34;, has been delivered to the installation site. Unfortunately, the fact that a deficiency exists is usually realized only after a majority of the delivered carpet has been installed and considerable installation time has been expended. In such a case, the retailer will usually first determine whether he has a sufficient amount of the same carpet in stock to overcome the deficiency. If he does not, the retailer must contact the manufacturer to see whether the manufacturer can cover the deficiency with the same dye lot. If the retailer is unsuccessful in obtaining the additional quantity of the matching dye lot, then the installed carpet must be removed and replaced with an amount of a new carpet which is sufficient to cover the entire floor. In many instances, the removed carpet is not suitable for reuse. Also, once the retailer has agreed with the customer as to the total price and estimated yardage needed for the job, and once most of the carpet has already been laid, it is highly unlikely that the customer would agree to pay more money for the extra yardage needed at this stage. The retailer therefore must absorb the additional expense. The costs incurred by a retailer when an insufficient quantity of carpet is delivered to the installation site can be substantial. In the more serious situation, where the remaining carpet required to complete the installation cannot be obtained, the retailer must absorb the cost of the original carpet and also the cost of its installation and removal. Moreover, even if the deficiency in the previously installed carpet can be made up from the retailer&#39;s stock or can be supplied by the carpet manufacturer, then the installation schedule is disrupted, orders may become backlogged, and the carpet installer&#39;s time will not be utilized efficiently. As may easily be envisioned, short measures may seriously affect the profitability of a carpet retailer. Many factors go into the proper calculation of the amount of carpet which should be delivered to an installation site. First, a minimum quantity of carpet corresponding to that which is required to cover the entire floor must be supplied to the installation site. To this minimum amount must be added additional quantities which are due to several factors. For example, the retailer must take into consideration the grain of the carpet pieces which will cover the floor of the installation site. It is absolutely necessary to install carpet so that the grain of each piece runs in the same direction as the adjacent piece. A piece of carpet which otherwise may be of the correct size and shape to cover a portion of the installation site thus may not have the correct shape if it is turned so that its grain remains consistent with the adjacent carpet piece. In addition, the retailer must also consider the continuity of the carpet pattern at the seams of the carpet pieces. For example, a piece of carpet may be of the correct size, shape and grain direction to cover a portion of the floor, but its pattern may not be continuous with the pattern of the adjacent pieces. As a consequence of the above-listed factors, waste or scrap pieces of carpet are usually created when the standard width carpet is cut during installation to fit the contours of the installation site floor. Since the cost of waste pieces must be paid for by the customer, it is desirable to minimize the amount of wasted carpet by utilizing carpet scraps, cut from pieces of carpet which have already been installed, to cover the floor of the installation site instead of using freshly cut pieces from the standard width carpet roll. As can easily be seen from the above description, a miscalculation of the number of linear feet of standard width carpet to be delivered to an installation site can be a critical factor in the material and labor expense of the retailer, and to the inconvenience of the customer. With all of the factors which must be accounted for, the calculation is complex, and the likelihood of error is high. Even if the above-mentioned factors are all properly accounted for by the retailer, on many occasions, the carpet layer may not install the carpet in the same manner envisioned by the retailer. As a result, the delivered carpet may not be sufficient to cover the entire floor of the installation site in an acceptable manner according to the customer (i.e., too many seams), even though sufficient carpet may have been delivered to cover the floor in an acceptable manner had the carpet been installed according to the retailer&#39;s plans. Since it is much more costly for the retailer if an insufficient amount of carpet is delivered to the installation site, most retailers err on the side of delivering too much carpet rather than too little, and unfortunately, the customer pays for the waste. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for allowing the accurate calculation of the minimum number of linear feet of carpet which must be cut from a standard width roll and delivered to an installation site to completely, properly and efficiently cover the floor at the installation site. The present invention allows the calculation to easily take into account factors such as uniform grain direction of adjacent carpet pieces and pattern continuity at the seams of adjacent pieces. The present invention is characterized by providing a roll of measurement tape which is scaled in width to the width of a standard roll of carpet. The measurement tape may be perforated at increments along its length and width, and includes indicators of carpet grain direction and pattern repetition intervals along its length and/or width. In use, pieces of the tape are removed from the roll by cutting or tearing along the perforations and are adhered to a transparent sheet which is laid over a scaled floor plan of an installation site. The pieces of tape are positioned in a manner representative of how the site is to be covered with carpet pieces. The particular size and shape of the pieces may be easily selected by tearing the pieces from the roll of tape along the perforations. Unused pieces of the tape represent potential waste carpet pieces. Since these pieces of tape (1) may be easily handled and accounted for, (2) are representative of the size and shape of the carpet scrap and (3) contain indicators of grain direction and pattern repetition, a determination may be easily made as to whether they are suitable for use in covering alternate areas of the floor plan, thereby minimizing the amount of carpet waste created. The total amount of carpet required to be delivered to the installation site may be made by determining the length of the scaled roll of tape which was required to completely cover the scaled floor plan. In addition, since the tape required to perform the determination is far less expensive than the carpet itself, numerous calculations may be performed utilizing different manners of tape piece placement on different transparent sheets covering the floor plan in order to determine which manner of cutting and positioning the carpet is the most economical with the least amount of seams.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to an objective lens adapter that is attachably/detachably attached to the distal end of an objective lens to protect a front lens of the objective lens. This application is based on Japanese Patent Application No. 2008-164638, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference. 2. Description of Related Art Conventionally, an adapter that is attachably/detachably attached to the distal end of an endoscope insertion unit has been known. By attaching this adapter, the field of view can be changed (for example, refer to Japanese Unexamined Patent Application, Publication No. Sho 56-85324). However, when attaching an adapter to the distal end of an objective lens in a microscope apparatus for conducting high-precision observation of a minute specimen at a high magnification, it is necessary to bring an optical element into contact with the distal end of the objective lens because the optical element needs to be precisely attached. In this case, in particular, when attaching to an objective lens having a small-diameter distal-end portion in which the diameter of the distal-end portion is extremely small for piercing biological tissue such as brains, to observe an organism in vivo, there is a problem in that the distal-end of the objective lens and the optical element may be damaged if an excessive pressing force is applied to the optical element at the time of attachment. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention has been conceived in light of the above-described situation, and an object thereof is to provide an objective lens adapter that makes high-precision observation possible while allowing contact between the distal end of an objective lens and an optical element without damaging the distal end of the objective lens and the optical element, even when attaching the objective lens adapter to and detaching the objective lens adapter from the distal end of the objective lens. To achieve the above object, the present invention provides the following solutions. One aspect of the present invention is an objective lens adapter having a fixed member that is fixed to a lens tube of an objective lens, a distal-end member including an optical element that is made to be placed in contact with the distal-end surface of the objective lens, and an elastic member that is disposed between the distal-end member and the fixed member and that urges the optical element in a direction that causes the optical element to contact the distal-end surface of the objective lens. According to the above-described aspect, by fixing the fixed member to the lens tube while keeping the optical element in contact with the distal-end surface of the objective lens, in a state in which the elastic force of the elastic member is generated, the distal-end member is pulled in a direction close to the fixed member by the elastic force of the elastic member; and thus the state in which the optical element is in contact with the distal-end surface of the objective lens can be maintained. Thus, the problem of damage to the distal-end portion of the objective lens and the optical element can be prevented because the optical element and the distal-end surface of the objective lens are not brought into contact with an excessive pressing force. In addition, it is possible to bring the optical element and the distal-end surface of the objective lens reliably into contact and to precisely position the optical element with respect to the distal-end surface of the objective lens, allowing high-precision observation to be conducted. The above-described aspect may be configured so that the distal end of the distal-end member is provided with a sharp portion that is inclined with respect to an optical axis. By doing so, when observing the inside of a specimen by piercing the distal end of the objective lens into the specimen, it is possible to make it easy to pierce the specimen with the distal end of the objective lens due to the sharp portion that is inclined with respect to the optical axis, and it is possible to observe the specimen in a good condition by piercing the specimen with the objective lens without causing excessive damage. In addition, in the above-described configuration, the optical element may be formed of a prism, which is accommodated in the sharp portion, having a reflection surface that is inclined with respect to the optical axis. By doing so, it is possible to conduct lateral-view observation of the specimen disposed in a direction intersecting the optical axis of the objective lens by bending the optical axis at the reflection surface of the prism. Because the sharp portion is inclined with respect to the optical axis, the prism having a reflection surface inclined with respect to the optical axis can be disposed fittingly into the internal space formed by the sharp portion. In addition, in the above-described aspect, the reflection surface may be provided with a reflection film. By doing so, the reflection efficiency at the reflection surface of the prism can be improved. By providing the reflection film on the reflection surface of the prism, the reflectivity is not reduced even though the reflection surface is exposed and comes in contact with the specimen, and thus, it is possible to conduct observation with a bright image. In addition, in the above-described aspect, it is preferable that a cover member that covers the reflection surface be disposed, and a concave portion that forms an air layer be provided on a surface of the cover member opposing the reflection surface. By doing so, the specimen does not come in contact with the reflection surface even when piercing the specimen with the distal-end member, and it is possible to totally reflect light at the reflection surface due to the air layer formed by the concave portion. The reflection efficiency improves as a result, and it is possible to conduct observation with a bright image. In addition, the optical element can be protected by covering the reflection surface of the optical element with the cover member. According to the present invention, an advantage is afforded in that high-precision observation is made possible while allowing contact between a distal end of the objective lens and an optical element without damaging the distal end of the objective lens and the optical element even when attaching the objective lens adapter to the distal end of the objective lens and detaching the objective lens adapter therefrom.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to a method for stimulating the growth of mammalian hair comprising the application to mammalian skin of a cyclopentane heptanoic acid, 2-cycloalkyl or arylalkyl derivative or a pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salt thereof, alone, or in association with a topical pharmaceutical carrier. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Dermatologists recognize many different types of hair loss, the most common by far being “alopecia” wherein human males begin losing scalp hair at the temples and on the crown of the head as they get older. While this type of hair loss is largely confined to males, hence its common name “male pattern baldness,” it is not unknown in women. No known cure has yet been found despite continuing attempts to discover one. A good deal is known about various types of human hair and its growth patterns on various parts of the body. For purposes of the present invention, it is necessary to consider various types of hair, including, terminal hairs and vellus hairs and modified terminal hairs, such as seen in eye lashes and eye brows. Terminal hairs are coarse, pigmented, long hairs in which the bulb of the hair follicle is seated deep in the dermis. Vellus hairs, on the other hand, are fine, thin, non-pigmented short hairs in which the hair bulb is located superficially in the dermis. As alopecia progresses, a transition takes place in the area of approaching baldness wherein the hairs themselves are changing from the terminal to the vellus type. Another factor that contributes to the end result is a change in the cycle of hair growth. All hair, both human and animal, passes through a life cycle that includes three phases, namely, the anagen phase, the catagen phase and the telogen phase. The anagen phase is the period of active hair growth and, insofar as scalp hair is concerned, this generally lasts from 3-5 years. The catagen phase is a short transitional phase between the anagen and telogen phases which, in the case of scalp hair, lasts only 1-2 weeks. The final phase is the telogen phase which, for all practical purposes, can be denominated a “resting phase” where all growth ceases and the hair eventually is shed preparatory to the follicle commencing to grow a new one. Scalp hair in the telogen phase is also relatively short-lived, some 3-4 months elapsing before the hair is shed and a new one begins to grow. Under normal hair growth conditions on the scalp, approximately 88% of the hairs are in the anagen phase, only 1% in catagen and the remainder in telogen. With the onset of male pattern baldness, a successively greater proportion of the hairs are in the telogen phase with correspondingly fewer in the active growth anagen phase. Alopecia is associated with the severe diminution of hair follicles. A bald human subject will average only about 306 follicles per square centimeter, whereas, a non-bald human in the same age group will have an average of 460 follicles per square centimeter. This amounts to a one-third reduction in hair follicles which, when added to the increased proportion of vellus hair follicles and the increased number of hair follicles in the telogen phase, is both significant and noticeable. Approximately 50% of the hairs must be shed to produce visible thinning of scalp hair. It is thus a combination of these factors: transition of hairs from terminal to vellus, increased number of telogen hairs—some of which have been shed, and loss of hair follicles that produces “baldness”. While a good deal is known about the results of male pattern baldness, very little is known about its cause. The cause is generally believed to be genetic and hormonal in origin although, the known prior art attempts to control it through hormone adjustment have been singularly unsuccessful. One known treatment for male pattern alopecia is hair transplantation. Plugs of skin containing hair are transplanted from areas of the scalp where hair is growing to bald areas with reasonable success; however, the procedure is a costly one in addition to being time-consuming and quite painful. Furthermore, the solution is inadequate from the standpoint that it becomes a practical, if not an economic, impossibility to replace but a tiny fraction of the hair present in a normal healthy head of hair. Other non-drug related approaches to the problem include such things as ultra-violet radiation, massage, psychiatric treatment and exercise therapy. None of these, however, has been generally accepted as being effective. Even such things as revascularization surgery and acupuncture have shown little, if any, promise. By far, the most common approach to the problem of discovering a remedy for hair loss and male pattern alopecia has been one of drug therapy. Many types of drugs ranging from vitamins to hormones have been tried and only recently has there been any indication whatsoever of even moderate success. For instance, it was felt for a long time that since an androgenic hormone was necessary for the development of male pattern baldness, that either systemic or topical application of an antiandrogenic hormone would provide the necessary inhibiting action to keep the baldness from occurring. The theory was promising but the results were uniformly disappointing. The androgenic hormone testosterone was known, for example, to stimulate hair growth when applied topically to the deltoid area as well as when injected into the beard and pubic regions. Even oral administration was found to result in an increased hair growth in the beard and pubic areas as well as upon the trunk and extremities. While topical application to the arm causes increased hair growth, it is ineffective on the scalp and some thinning may even result. Heavy doses of testosterone have even been known to cause male pattern alopecia. Certain therapeutic agents have been known to induce hair growth in extensive areas of the trunk, limbs and even occasionally on the face. Such hair is of intermediate status in that it is coarser than vellus but not as coarse as terminal hair. The hair is generally quite short with a length of 3 cm. being about maximum. Once the patient ceases taking the drug, the hair reverts to whatever is normal for the particular site after six months to a year has elapsed. An example of such a drug is diphenylhydantoin which is an anticonvulsant drug widely used to control epileptic seizures. Hypertrichosis is frequently observed in epileptic children some two or three months after starting the drug and first becomes noticeable on the extensor aspects of the limbs and later on the trunk and face. (The same pattern of hypertrichosis is sometimes caused by injury to the head.) As for the hair, it is often shed when the drug is discontinued but may, in some circumstances, remain. Streptomycin is another drug that has been found to produce hypertrichosis, in much the same way as diphenylhydantoin, when administered to children suffering from tuberculous meningitis. About the same effects were observed and the onset and reversal of the hypertrichosis in relation to the period of treatment with the antibiotic leave little question but that it was the causative agent. Two treatments have been demonstrated as showing some promise in reversing male pattern alopecia. These treatments include the use of a microemulsion cream containing both estradiol and oxandrolone as its active ingredients and the use of organic silicon. In addition to the foregoing, it has been reported in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,139,619 and 4,968,812 that the compound minoxidil is useful for the treatment of male pattern baldness. That compound, among others, has proven to have considerable therapeutic value in the treatment of severe hypertension. It is a so-called “vasodilator” which, as the name implies, functions to dilate the peripheral vascular system. Dermatologists and others have recognized that prolonged vasodilation of certain areas of the human body other than the scalp sometimes result in increased hair growth even in the absence of any vasodilating therapeutic agent. For instance, increased hair growth around surgical scars is not uncommon. Similarly, arteriovenous fistula have been known to result in increased vascularity accompanied by enhanced hair growth. Externally-induced vasodilation of the skin, such as, for example, by repeated biting of the limbs by the mentally retarded and localized stimulation of the shoulders by water carries has been known to bring on hypertrichosis in the affected areas. Be that as it may, similar techniques such as continued periodic massage of the scalp have been found to be totally ineffective as a means for restoring lost hair growth to the scalp. Scar tissue on the scalp inhibits rather than promotes hair growth. U.S. Pat. No. 6,262,105 to Johnstone suggests that prostaglandins and derivatives thereof are useful in a method of enhancing hair growth. Bimatoprost, which is sold by Allergan, Inc. of Irvine, Calif., U.S.A. as Lumigan® ophthalmic solution, for treating glaucoma now has been found as being effective to increase the growth of eyelashes when applied in the FDA approved manner.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to a composition and procedure for manipulating the behaviour of nun moth, Lymantria monacha (L.), and gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.). More particularly, this invention relates to the preparation and use of chiral and racemic disparlure, chiral or racemic cis-7,8-epoxy-octadecane, 2-methyl-Z7-octadecene and Z7-octadecene for manipulating the behaviour of nun moth and gypsy moths. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Nun moth, Lymantria monacha (L.) (NM), occurs in Central and Eastern Europe and isolated areas in Asia. Spreading widely, it reached the Ukraine in 1949-1952, and central European Russia and western Siberia in 1954-1957 (1). In northern and north-western Europe its distribution is limited to South England, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland. In southern Europe, NM is present in Portugal, northern Spain, Croatia, Italy, Yugoslavia, Greece and Bulgaria. NM is one of the most important forest pests in Europe (2, 3). Although it is considered the classic insect pest of spruce forests (3), it also defoliates coniferous hosts belonging to the genera Picea, Pinus, Larix, and Abies. Of deciduous trees, Carpinus, Betula, Quercus, Alnus and Acer be attacked (4). Previous NM outbreaks exemplify the economic impact of this defoliator in Europe, and demonstrate the tremendous threat to North America&#39;s forest industry, if NM were introduced and became established in the new world. In 1853-1863, for example, 403,000 km 2  (about 155,000 square miles) of (now) Poland-Russia were damaged or destroyed (4). During the massive outbreak in Poland in 1978-1984, 6.3 million ha of coniferous and mixed stands were affected (5), and in Eastern Germany in 1983 and 1984, extensive countermeasures were necessary to control a NM outbreak on more than 300,000 ha of forest land (6). Methods for monitoring and forecasting NM epidemics have been based upon larval frass droppings and counts per tree of larvae, pupae, adults and eggs (7). Monitoring of NM using the sex pheromone of live females started as early as 1932 in Czechoslovakia (8). With the identification of a NM sex pheromone component, 2-methyl-cis-7,8-epoxy-octadecane (disparlure) (9), efforts are ongoing to correlate catches of NM males in pheromone-baited traps with NM population densities (2, 10, 11, 12, 13). NM populations are currently monitored by pheromone traps in many parts of Europe (14). Pheromones have also been considered for post-outbreak control of NM through mating disruption. In 1980 and 1982 in Denmark, pheromone traps placed in areas aprayed with microencapsulated disparlure caught no NM males, whereas traps in control areas attracted large number of males (15). Moreover, 10-20 g of disparlure/ha dispensed per flight season successfully disoriented NM males in stands of low NM population densities (16). There is, however, evidence that disparlure is not the only NM sex pheromone component, and that the efficacy (species-specificity) of pheromone-based monitoring and/or control of NM populations could be improved. Sympatric and co-seasonal gypsy moth (GM), Lymantria dispar (L.), also utilizes disparlure as a pheromone component (17, 18). Even though female GM may emit only 7R,8S-disparlure and female NM may emit both 7R,8S-(10%) and 7S,8R-(90%)-disparlure (19), inhibitory characteristics of the SR-enantiomer do not entirely prevent cross attraction of GM males to racemic RS- plus SR-disparlure baited traps (20-25). Moreover, increasing the amount of the olefin precursor of disparlure, 2-methyl-Z7-octadecene, in disparlure baits progressively reduced attraction of GM males and prompted Grant et al. to test the olefin as a candidate pheromone component for NM (26). Finally, pheromone communication of GM during the day and of NM at night contributes to reproductive isolation, but mate seeking males of both species are encountered at sunset (27). This overlap in diurnal flight periodicity suggested additional as yet unidentified sex pheromone components in both moths which could impart specificity to their chemical communication. For example, in competitive tests, NM females were more effective than GM females in attracting NM males (9 plus references therein). Previous patents related to the capture, monitoring or control of GM adults comprise: (1) treatment of female GM abdominal tips with a solution of m-chloro-perbenzoic acid (28); (2) the preparation (synthesis) of disparlure (29,30); (3) a dispenser for release of (+)-disparlure (31); (4) a sprayable adhesive for GM pheromone beads (32); and (5) various trap types (33,34,35,36). This document describes the multiple component NM pheromone blend and reveals the compounds that inhibit cross-attraction of congeneric GM. Because NM and GM males captured in monitoring traps quickly loose their characteristic body and wing scales, and because NM occurs in many color morphs, which are not recognized by non-experienced personal, species-specific lures become extremely valuable and important. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection (GC-EAD) analyses of female nun moth (NM), Lymantria monacha (L.), pheromone gland extract revealed 5 antennally active compounds. They were identified as: 1) Z7-octadecene; 2) 2-methyl-Z7-octadecene; 3) cis-7,8-epoxy-octadecane, 4) 2-methyl-cis-7,8-epoxy-octadecane (previously known as disparlure), and 5) cis-7,8-epoxy-nonadecane. In field experiments near Zbraslav, Czech Republic, a ternary combination of 2-methyl-7R,8S-epoxy-octadecane (7R,8S-disparlure), 2-methyl-Z7-octadecene and 7R,8S-epoxy-octadecane at a 10:1:10 ratio was most effective in attracting NM males. Antipodes of 7R,8S-disparlure and of 7R,8S-epoxy-octadecane neither enhanced nor reduced attractiveness of the lure for NM males. Cross attraction of gypsy moth (GM), Lymantria dispar (L.), males was reduced by each of 7S,8R-disparlure, 7R,8S-epoxy-octadecane, 7S,8R-epoxy-octadecane, 2-methyl-Z7-octadecene, and Z7-octadecene, but these compounds in combinations were most inhibitory to GM. The essence of the invention is the preparation and use of chiral and racemic disparlure, chiral or racemic cis-7,8-epoxy-octadecane and 2-methyl-Z7-octadecene for manipulating the behavior of NM and GM. The invention is directed to a composition of chemicals for manipulating the behavior of nun moth and/or gypsy moth, said composition comprising  two or more chemicals selected from the group consisting of: (a)! 2-methyl-7R,8S-epoxy-octadecane (RS-disparlure);  (b)! 2-methyl-7S,8R-epoxy-octadecane (SR-disparlure); and 2-methyl-Z7-octadecene plus one or more chemicals selected from the group consisting of  (c)! (a) 7R,8S-epoxy-octadecane;  (d)! (b) 7S,8R-epoxy-octadecane;  (e) 2-methyl-Z7-octadecane;! and  (f)! (c). Z7-octadecene. The chemicals in the composition can comprise 7R,8S-disparlure and 7R,8S-epoxy-octadecane. The chemicals can comprise 7R,8S-disparlure and 2-methyl-Z7-octadecene.

The chemicals can comprise 7E,8S-disparlure, 7S,8R-disparlure, 7R,8S-epoxy-octadecane, 7S,8R-epoxy-octadecane and 2-methyl-Z7-octadecene. The chemicals can comprise 7R,8S-disparlure, 7S,8R-disparlure, 7R,8S-epoxy-octadecane, 7S,8R-epoxy-octadecane, 2-methyl-Z7-octadecene and Z7-octadecene. The chemicals&#39; proportions can cover all possible combinations and ratios. The composition can be contained in, and released from, a trap that captures attracted nun moths or gypsy moths. The chemicals can be contained in, and released from, slow release devices.

    "abstract": "The invention is directed to systems and methods for monitoring and controlling use of medical devices. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Use of medical devices intended to treat or diagnose conditions of the body can sometimes generate stress on the material or materials from which the devices are made. The material stress can alter the physical characteristics of the devices, making future performance of the devices unpredictable. In addition, exposure to blood and tissue during use can entrap biological components on or within many medical devices. Despite cleaning and subsequent sterilization, the presence of entrapped biological components can lead to unacceptable pyrogenic reactions. The effects of material stress and damage caused during a single use of a medical device, coupled with the possibility of pyrogen reactions even after resterilization, reasonably justify imposing a single use restriction upon many medical devices. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides systems and methods for monitoring and controlling use of medical devices. The systems and methods employ a controller to control operation of the device and a reader to download information to the controller. The systems and methods also include a usage key card adapted to be handled separate from the device and comprising a storage medium formatted to contain an identification code unique to the usage key card. Upon reading by the reader, the identification code is downloaded to the controller. The controller includes a first data state prior to downloading of the identification code. A processing function for processing the identification code enables operation of the device if the identification code correlates in a pre-established manner with the first data state. The processing function operates, in response to enabling operation of the device, to change the first data state to a second data state that prevents subsequent operation of the device in response to downloading of the identification code. In one embodiment, the processing function causes the controller to create a table by registering unlike identification codes in memory as they are downloaded by the reader. The controller enables operation of the device when a new identification code is registered in the table. In one embodiment, the processing function causes the controller to disable operation of the device when the given identification code matches an identification code in the table. In one embodiment, the processing function causes the controller to register in the table, a time period of use of the device. In this arrangement, the processing function causes the controller to disable operation of the device when the time of use exceeds a prescribed period. In one embodiment, the device applies radio frequency energy to the tissue region. Features and advantages of the inventions are set forth in the following Description and Drawings, as well as in the appended Claims.",

    "abstract": "The invention relates to a therapeutic system for applying active substances. to the skin, with a backing layer remote from the skin, at least one active substance depot, an active substance distribution device which is linked with the active substance depot, an active substance delivery control device controlling the delivery of the active substance through the system and a pressure sensitive adhesive fixing device for the therapeutic system on the skin, its use and process for the production thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Therapeutic systems for the transdermal administration of medicaments supply one or more active substances at a predetermined rate and in continuous manner over a fixed period to a given application point on the skin. These systems are therapeutic precision instruments ensuring a continuous active substance release. Such therapeutic systems can have both a topical and a systemic action and the large number of active substances which can be applied in this way and their different chemical, physical and pharmacological characteristics make ever new demands on the production of such systems. Conventionally these transdermal systems have at least one active substance reservoir, where the active substance is present in solid, liquid or disperse molecular form and an adhesion layer through which the system is closely connected with the skin and through which active substance transfer takes place, a control membrane and protective/covering layers which are substantially impermeable for the active substance. The known systems are difficult to manufacture and have a complicated structure. One problem of conventional systems is that of being able to process readily volatile active substances, because the evaporation of the active substance is difficult to control during production. Thermally sensitive active substances can only be used to a limited extent in the system in the case of matrices or therapeutic systems which have to be thermally treated and which are produced with heat treatment stages. Attempts have already been made to introduce pure active substance in fine-crystalline form into a pressure sensitive adhesive polymer, so that the finely divided, fine-crystalline active substance dissolves with time as depot crystals in the adhesive matrix layer (DE-OS 35 00 508=U.S. Pat. No. 4,719,226). This process is not suitable for volatile and thermally sensitive active substances, because it includes thermal treatment stages. Another attempt to increase the capacity of such therapeutic systems comprises embedding in a pressure sensitive adhesive layer of such a system active substance depots in the form of microcapsules, which are surrounded by a control membrane (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,598,123 and 3,731,683). The production of such control membrane-surrounded microcapsules is extremely complicated and expensive and cannot be performed for many active substances. The mixing of the active substance-containing microcapsules under a reservoir material constitutes a further difficult process stage, during which the micro-capsules can easily be damaged or destroyed, which can lead to an unsatisfactory constancy of the active substance content in the finished therapeutic system. The process of U.S. Pat. No. 3,598,123 is difficult to perform for liquid active substances, particularly if the liquid substance is present in readily volatile form. German patent 3 424 837 discloses a depot plaster, which can be used for liquid materials and has a covering film, a liquid active substance in an outwardly bulging region of the covering film and a control membrane covering the active substance and permeable for the latter. Between the covering film and the control membrane is provided an active substance distribution device, namely a non-woven fabric, which uniformly distributes the active substance liquid on the control membrane and which is effective over a large surface area. In the case of the depot plaster of German patent 3 424 837 the covering film and the control membrane are welded together in their outer regions in order to prevent an outward flow of the liquid active substance. However, the known depot plaster is disadvantageous in that the liquid therein flows freely and can easily run out if the adhesive or welded edges are damaged and also requires an expensive control membrane, which must be provided in addition to the active substance distribution device in order to kinetically control the delivery of the active substance. The problem of the present invention is consequently to provide a novel therapeutic system with active substance depot for the administration of the active substance, which can be manufactured less expensively and more reliably than the prior art systems which is also suitable for processing volatile and/or thermally unstable components. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the invention this problem is solved by a therapeutic system, which is characterized in that the active substance distribution device and the active substance delivery control device are a reservoir matrix having one or more discrete active substance depots arranged in a spatially defined manner with respect to one another and having a higher active substance concentration than in the reservoir matrix. During the production of the therapeutic system, the reservoir matrix can be free from active substances and is only enriched therewith over a period of time, i.e. during the storage of the system or, in the case of highly volatile substances, during the production of the system. Thus, it is an advantage of the invention that now active substances, which are thermally unstable and/or volatile can be introduced during manufacture into transdermal systems in the form of a depot and without any thermal stressing. There is no need for stages, such as the mixing of the reservoir matrix material with the active substance, and instead said material becomes saturated with the active substance at room temperature during the storage of the therapeutic system. Production is simplified due to the omission of the production stages for the active substance-saturated matrix. More specifically the invention is directed to a method for making a transdermal therapeutic system, comprising, (a) applying a pressure sensitive adhesive to a detachable protective layer; (b) applying an absorbent fabric material to the pressure sensitive adhesive;",

    "abstract": "The invention relates to securing fasteners within the body, and more particularly to securing a fastener head within an aperture in an implant. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Bones and bony structures are susceptible to a variety of weaknesses that can affect their ability to provide support and structure. Weaknesses in bony structures may have many causes, including degenerative diseases, tumors, fractures, and dislocations. Advances in medicine and engineering have provided doctors with a plurality of devices and techniques for alleviating or curing these weaknesses. The cervical spine has presented challenges for doctors, partially due to the small size of the vertebrae and the spacing between adjacent vertebrae. Typically, weaknesses in the cervical spine, for example, are corrected by using devices that fuse one or more vertebrae together. Common devices involve plate systems that align and maintain adjacent cervical vertebrae in a desired position, with a desired spacing. These devices, commonly referred to as bone fixation plating systems, typically include one or more plates and screws for aligning and holding vertebrae in a fixed position with respect to one another. Initial devices used stainless steel plates and screws. In order to remain fixed in place, the screws were required to pass completely through the vertebrae and into the spinal canal. These devices caused many complications and involved significant risks. To allow a screw to pass, drilling and then tapping of the vertebrae was required. In the process, instruments came within close proximity of the spinal cord, which required extreme care on the part of the surgeon. In addition to the risks of surgically applying bone fixation plates, other complications arose. Commonly, these problems involve loosening and failure of the hardware. Two common failures are the breakage of the plates, and the backing out of the screws into soft tissues of the patient&#39;s body. The backing out of the screws is typically a result of the screws failure to achieve a sufficient purchase in the bone, although the stripping of the screws has also been known to cause this problem. Regardless of the cause of the hardware failures, a surgeon must repair or replace the broken parts, which requires undesirable invasive procedures. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the disclosure, a fastener is insertable within an implant in a body, where the implant has an aperture through which the fastener may be inserted, the aperture including a curved inner profile defining a larger dimension and a smaller dimension, the fastener comprising: an elongated body; a head connected to the body and defining a curved profile mateable with the curved inner profile of the implant, the head further including a circumferential groove disposable proximate the larger dimension of the curved inner profile of the implant when the head is mated with the implant; and an open ring sized to be positionable partly within the circumferential groove to extend from the circumferential groove to thereby increase a widest dimension of the head, the ring formed with a resilient material, the ring resiliently expandable from a first compressed configuration having a first dimension to a second relaxed configuration having a second dimension, the second dimension larger than the first dimension, the head passable into the aperture when the ring is assembled into the groove and the ring is in the first compressed configuration, and the head not passable out of the aperture when the ring is resiliently expanded to the second configuration, due to the ring interfering in the second configuration with the smaller dimension of the curved inner profile. In embodiments, the ring further includes a first end and a second end, the first end fixable within the groove, the second end moveable to change the ring from the first configuration to the second configuration; the ring further includes a first end and a second end, the first end fixed within the circumferential groove, and the second end moveable to change a shape of the ring from the first compressed configuration to the second relaxed configuration, the second end including a notch releasably engageable to maintain the ring in the first compressed configuration; a pin is removably connectable with the head and insertable into the notch to engage the notch to maintain the ring in the first compressed configuration, or removed from the notch to disengage the notch and enable the ring to resiliently expand to the second dimension. In other embodiments, the fastener head is a polyaxial fastener head; the aperture is formed in an implant selected from the group consisting of bone plate, bone spacer, and prosthetic device; the fastener head further includes an access port through which an object may be inserted to maintain the ring in the first compressed configuration; the ring forming two ends, at least one of the ends forming a notch, the fastener further including a pin engageable with the head and the notch to maintain the ring in the compressed configuration when the pin is engaged with the head and the notch; the pin further including a pin head engageable with a tool to insert or remove the pin from the notch.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a device and a method for determining the aperture angle of a joint lying between two body structures. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Artificial hip joints are known in which a femur implant is introduced into a bodily femur, after a head of the bodily joint has been removed. A joint cavity is introduced into the hip as a counter bearing, which, as an abutment, can accommodate a spherical or partially spherical head of the femur implant. Seating the implants precisely is a fundamental criterion for successfully implanting a hip joint. Even the smallest deviations can lead to excessively rapid wear and tear and, therefore, to a short service life of the hip joint implant. In the event of a sudden stress, such as, for example, an impact, a hip implant, which is not introduced precisely, can easily be dislocated or loosened. Therefore, it is advantageous to intra-operatively verify that an implanted joint is correctly seated and positioned. It is known that, while implanting a hip joint, a surgeon manually moves a patient&#39;s leg in various directions until it is prevented from moving further by the patient&#39;s anatomy, the implanted components meeting adjacent bones, or encumbrances by tissues or ligaments. An experienced surgeon uses this manual movement to assess the flexibility of the joint and, therefore, how to correctly seat the individual components of an implanted joint. However, a surgeon can only very roughly assess whether flexibility ascertained and assessed in this way is sufficient for the patient&#39;s daily life. A device and a method for determining the position of a component of an implant are known from U.S. Pat. No. 6,002,859, in which a model of the joint and the implant components are generated and a movement of the joint is simulated using the models. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to one aspect, the invention relates to determining an aperture angle of a joint lying between two body structures, such as, for example, the aperture angle of a hip joint, a knee joint, an elbow joint or other joints. It is to be appreciated that the term “aperture angle” is intended to be understood, for example, in the case of the ball joint-like hip joint, both as the angle between a fixed upper leg axis and a plane or axis defined by the position of the hip, and as the spatial position or orientation of the angle. The intention is, for example, to ascertain how far the femur is inclined forwards, backwards or to the side, relative for example to the hip, i.e. the spatial angle which the joint forms is determined. The intention is also, for example, to ascertain how a joint or parts or structures thereof are rotated, for example, about a center axis. It is an object of the present invention to propose a device and a method for determining the aperture angle of a joint, which can be used to precisely verify whether implant components are correctly seated. In one embodiment, the device for determining the aperture angle of a joint, such as, for example, a natural or an artificial joint, and/or for determining relative positions of components or structures, can be used before, while and after a joint implant is implanted in order, for example, to intra-operatively ascertain the aperture angle or the range of motion of a joint. If necessary, the device can be used to make modifications to the implanted joint components or the position of the joint component and/or to the patient&#39;s anatomy, e.g., by surgery. A detection device can be provided. The detection device can include, for example, a camera for detecting visible or infrared light, electromagnetic sensors (magnetic tracking), a sound sensor, or a system based on radio, using which the position of the components forming the joint and/or the structures connected to the joint or to be connected to the joint can be ascertained. Changes in the position and/or the rotational position of one or more components or structures can be detected, such that, for example, the changes can be ascertained in six degrees of freedom. In this way, markers can be attached in a known way to the respective components forming the joint or to adjacent structures. For example, markers can be attached to the hip and the femur and/or to the implanted components, in order to detect the position of the respective structures or components once the corresponding elements, provided with markers, have been registered. Furthermore, a computational unit can be provided to which the positional signals ascertained by the detection device, such as, for example, the optically detected outlines of a structure or signals emitted for example by markers, and, therefore, the position of the elements or structures connected to these markers is supplied, in order to ascertain the aperture angle or the spatial angle in general of a joint or an angle formed by two structures from this information. The device in accordance with the invention thus enables an improvement in verifying and assessing, and, therefore, in performing, the implantation of an artificial joint, such that the outcome of implantation can be improved. Positional values and angular values can be automatically ascertained, in order, for example, to verify that a joint is correctly seated using movements performed manually or automatically, for example, using robots. Taking into account anatomically relevant influencing parameters, such as the ligaments, soft tissues, etc., it can be ascertained whether movements, which may be performed using the implanted joint, are sufficient or whether the implant or the seating of the implant still has to be changed, in order to obtain the desired range of motion of the joint. A joint can, for example, be moved in each direction until it is no longer possible, using normal force, to open or close the joint further due to it colliding with a body structure or a component of the joint or due to other factors, such that the range of motion of the joint can be ascertained in various directions. Precise angular values can be ascertained by the device in accordance with the invention, which can be compared, for example, with predetermined reference values, to verify the correct seating or the correct functionality of a joint, without being reliant on the experience of a surgeon. Thus, in accordance with the invention, the actual positions of the joint components and/or of the body structures connected to the joint, such as, for example, the hip and the femur, can be ascertained three-dimensionally, even intra-operatively. In addition, their position relative to each other can be determined, such that the aperture angle of the joint can be precisely measured in various directions or the six degrees of freedom determining the spatial position and orientation can be precisely measured. A data output device, such as a display for outputting the ascertained aperture angle of the joint or a screen, can be provided. The three-dimensional spatial position of the joint can be shown together on the data output device with the parameters describing the position of the joint, such as, for example, the aperture angle and the spatial position of the aperture angle. In one embodiment, the device for determining the aperture angle of a joint can include a device for applying defined forces onto the joint or a particular joint component in defined directions. For example, the device for applying defined forces can include a robot or a manually-operable device, which can display an applied force, in order to be able to ascertain how far a joint is moved when particular forces are applied. This can be used to obtain defined measurements, which can, for example, be compared with previously recorded reference values. In accordance with another embodiment of the invention, a method for determining the aperture angle of a joint includes detecting the position of the structures forming the joint and ascertaining the aperture angle from the detected positions. The method can, for example, be used intra-operatively, to measure the aperture angle or the flexibility in general of a joint during or after surgery, so as to provide information to assist the surgeon&#39;s work. No surgery is necessary to perform the method since only the position of the components forming the joint and/or of the adjacent body structures are recorded. This can be accomplished, for example, using attached markers, by detecting the outlines or using other suitable methods, and the aperture angle is calculated from the information recorded in this way. Recordings of the natural or artificial joint and/or of body structures adjacent to the joint can be used to determine the aperture angle or spatial angle of a joint, wherein nuclear spin resonance (MR) methods, computer tomography (CT) methods, ultrasound methods or other suitable methods can be used. The recorded body structures can be sub-divided into individual elements, for example, using known segmentation or separating methods. In this way, the borders of adjacent structures can be obtained from the recorded data, in order to have data for calculating the aperture angle from positional data of the body structures or for calculating an optimum position for a joint to be implanted. In general, bone structures are detected in an image data set in a way that is substantially dependent on how the patient is positioned or lying at the time the image data are detected. There are rough instructions for radiology and for the patient with respect to a desired position for recording the image data set. However, the variable positions of the individual bone structures can be virtually moved to an initial position or neutral position to be defined, to provide a precise basis for comparison, which also enables comparison between a number of patients. After segmenting, three local co-ordinate systems can be defined, such as, for example, Femur Left, Femur Right and Pelvis. These can then be oriented with respect to each other in accordance with a fixed specification and can thus be moved into a defined positional relationship. If one then wishes to visualize positional data, such as, for example, angles, length of leg or of a joint, then this neutral position can be used as a starting position with respect to which an aperture angle or a spatial position can be defined. In this way, initial conditions can be created, which may even be reproduced and compared with each other for various patients. In one embodiment, an image data set can be recorded in an arbitrary position. By segmenting individual body structures, for example, Hip, Femur Left and Femur Right can be identified as individual elements. Coordinate systems can be assigned to the individual, segmented structures, where the coordinate systems enable the structures to be virtually aligned in the neutral position. Reference elements, such as, for example, reflective markers, can be attached to the joint to be implanted. In one embodiment, the reference elements can be attached to the individual components of the joint and/or to the body structures adjacent to the joint. This enables one to ascertain and track the spatial position of the joint or of the individual joint components and/or the corresponding body structures, once the respective elements have been registered. As such, the spatial positions of the individual joint components and/or the spatial positions of the body structure adjacent to the joint are available, for example, for ascertaining a possible range of motion of a joint.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to an endoscope and, more particularly, to an endoscope with a device to facilitate recognition of shapes of imaged objects. 2. Description of the Prior Art The recognition of shapes of imaged objects on a display can be facilitated in an endoscope by incorporating a device for projecting patterned light beams on imaged objects and measuring deviation of an imaged pattern from the original pattern due to parallax. The patterned light beams are provided, for example, by means of laser beams through a diffraction grating. Such a device is shown in FIG. 1. A grating 1 is constructed by combining two sheets of glass-fibres, each sheet being comprised of an array of glass-fibres, such that each glass-fibre of one sheet intersects with glass-fibres of the other sheet at right angle. As shown in FIG. 1, when laser beams 2 from a laser 3 are shone on such a diffraction grating 1, patterned beams 4 emerge from the other side which when projected on a flat screen 5 exhibit a regular array of spots as a diffraction pattern. Now, if such patterned beams 4 are projected on an irregular surface and spots on the surface are observed from a point separated from a point from which patterned beams 4 emerged, a deviation of an observed pattern from the original pattern appears, which is a phenomenon known as a parallax. This is shown in FIG. 2, where G is the point from which the patterned beams 4 emerge, A is the point of observation, Pa is a parallax distance separating G and A, and the patterned beams 4 are projected on the irregular surface of an object 6 to be imaged. Since deviations of patterns due to parallax depend on parallax distances and shapes of surfaces, by fixing a parallax distance the information on the shape of an object can be obtained from the observation of a deviation. This can be implemented in an endoscope by fixing a diffraction grating at a certain distance away from an imaging device. As for a measurement of deviation, the conventional method has been manual operations by an operator who identifies centers of the spots from the observations of a displayed image and registers positions of the spots on a display by means of a digitizer. It can easily be seen that such operations are extremely cumbersome as well as time consuming. To alleviate this situation, the measurements of the positions of the centers of the spots can be handled automatically by means of the binarization of a displayed view according to a particular threshold brightness and the thinning of the spot pattern. However, determining an appropriate threshold brightness can be very subtle, because errors such as false identifications of empty points as spots or misidentifications of spots as empty points due to smearings or noises may easily occur, and even one such error can lead to an incorrect recognition of shapes. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an endoscope with a device for shape recognition in which measurements of spot positions are automatic, results of spot identification are indicated in a manner that facilitates simple and quick inspections, and errors in the spot identification can be corrected in a simple and quick manner. This object is achieved in the present invention by providing an endoscope comprising, light source means for generating illumination lights; beam generator means for generating projection lights; a scope including diffraction grating means for producing patterned beams from the projection lights, imaging device means for taking images of objects to be imaged, and light guide means for illuminating the objects by illumination lights; camera control unit means for converting signals from the imaging device means into image signals; display means for displaying images taken; means for identifying positions of the spots made on the objects by means of the patterned beams; means for indicating the positions of the spots identified by the identifying means on the display means; means for correcting errors found in the positions of the spots identified by the identifying means; and means for adjusting the indications on the display means of the positions of the spots by the indicating means according to the corrections made by the correcting means.

    "abstract": "The present invention provides a memory chip for use in an oximeter sensor, or an associated adapter or connector circuit. The memory chip allows the storing of different data to provide enhanced capabilities for the oximeter sensor. In addition to providing unique data to store in such a memory, the invention describes unique uses of data stored in such a memory. The data stored in the memory chip includes information relating to enhancing the performance of the oximetry system. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a pulse oximeter system in accordance with the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a pulse oximeter system incorporating a calibration memory element  56  according to the invention. In one embodiment, memory element  56  is a two-lead semiconductor digital memory chip. The calibration element is part of the sensor  50  which also includes red and infrared LEDs  52  as in the prior art, along with a detector  54 . If desired, LEDs  52  may be replaced with other light emitting elements such as lasers. The oximeter includes read circuit  60 , drive circuit  66 , look-up tables  62  and  63 , controller  64 , amplifier  72 , filter  74 , and analog-to-digital converter  76 . Read circuit  60  is provided for reading multiple coded values across the two leads  51 ,  53  connected to calibration element  56 . One value is provided to a look-up table  62  to determine appropriate wavelength dependent coefficients for the oxygen saturation calculation, as in the prior art. The other value(s) are then provided to another look up table(s)  63  which provides input (e.g., coefficients) to other calculations performed by controller  64 . These additional calculations may enhance the performance and/or safety of the system. Controller  64  provides signals to a drive circuit  66 , to control the amount of drive current provided to LEDs  52 . Memory  56  may, for example, be implemented as a random access memory (RAM), a FLASH memory, a programmable read only memory (PROM), an electrically erasable PROM, a similar programmable and/or erasable memory, any kind of erasable memory, a write once memory, or other memory technologies capable of write operations. As in the prior art, detector  54  is connected through an amplifier  72  and a filter  74  to an A/D converter  76 . This forms a feedback path used by controller  64  to adjust the drive current to optimize the intensity range of the signal received. For proper operation the signal must be within the analog range of the circuits employed. The signal should also be well within the range of A/D converter  76  (e.g., one rule that may be applied is to adjust LED drives and amplifier gains so that both red and IR signals fall between 40% and 80% of full scale reading of converter  76 ). This requires correct and independent settings for both the red and infrared LEDs. Numerous types of data can be stored in memory chip  56 . Some of these types of data are now discussed. Temperature at Which to Switch to Motion-Signal Algorithm The motion-signal algorithm here refers to the sensors designed to be used where “motion provides the signal”, i.e., the cardiac pulse need not be present or discernible in order for the oximeter to provide SP 0   2  values. Instead, the red and IR waveforms resulting from the motion itself are used for determining the arterial saturation (see e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,018,673). This feature is possible for tissue beds that are well “arterialized” (a large supply of arterial blood relative to the metabolic needs of the tissue) resulting in a small aterio-venous saturation difference, as well as other signal characteristics that are not germane to this discussion. We have observed that the necessary degree of arterialization correlates well to being “well perfused” at the tissue site, which itself correlates well to the tissue bed being warm. Thus by monitoring the temperature of the skin at the sensor site, and by knowing a value of temperature (programmed into the memory chip) at which the “motion-signal ” algorithm can be utilized for the specific sensor design being used, improved reading accuracy through motion can be better accomplished. Information on Use of Pins Chemical Sensor for EtO Cycles An electro-chemical or thermal device that senses and stores to memory the number of exposures (zero, once, or potentially more than once or the actual number) to sterilization cycles could be used to capture the history of the sensor. Excessive exposure to sterilization cycles degrades a number of components in the sensor, and can affect its performance. A sensor exceeding a certain number of exposures could cause a display to indicate the sensor needs to be replaced.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to surgical products and, more particularly, to medical needles for penetrating bodily cavities, including fluid conducting needles and the like. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Intravenous (I.V.) Needles, catheters and the like are known in the medical arts as the means by which fluids are introduced into and withdrawn from a fluid-carrying body cavity such as, for example, a blood vessel including a vein or an artery. The typical I.V. needle consists of an elongated, generally cylindrical tube formed of surgical steel having one end which is ground, cut or otherwise formed to provide a pointed, gently sloping portion adapted for penetration through the subject&#39;s skin and into a selected body cavity, e.g., a blood vessel. Once properly situated within the body cavity, fluids including, but not limited to, blood, blood products, nutrients and drugs, may be infused into and/or: extracted from the body cavity through the I.V. needle. In perhaps the most common use of I.V. needles, an I.V. needle or catheter is inserted into a blood vessel. Medical personnel experienced in inserting such needles can, for many patients, properly insert the needle into a selected vein or artery in one or two attempts so as to achieve satisfactory fluid flow through the needle. However, for many other patients whose vasculature may not be readily accessible for reasons including, inter alia, displacement of the yieldable vessel resulting from contact by the inserted needle, small vessel size, excessive depth of the vessel beneath the skin, and the like, several insertions of the needle may be required before sufficient penetration of the vessel is accomplished and acceptable fluid flow through the needle can be established. As a consequence, these latter patients must endure the pain and trauma of being repeatedly pierced by sharp and sometimes relatively large diameter needles before sufficient fluid flow is attained. Further, in instances of emergency in which medical fluids must be quickly introduced into the patient, excessive time spent attempting to properly insert and place the needle may result in potentially harmful delay in administration of necessary emergency treatment with possible, dire consequences for the patient. An advantage exists, therefore, for a medical needle which can reliably penetrate a body cavity, particularly a blood vessel, whereby satisfactory fluid flow into or from the body cavity through the needle can generally be achieved by a single insertion of the needle into a patient.",

    "abstract": "The invention relates to the class of indoors games in which players competitively attempt to maneuver a ball or other playing piece into their opponent&#39;s goal, or other recess in a table or the like, while protecting their own goal. 2. Description of the Prior Art Numerous indoors games have been devised which are played with one or a plurality of balls or other playing pieces, and in which the objective of the game is to maneuver object balls on a table into a hole or pocket. A classic example is the game of pool. In this game, a player uses a cue stick to propel a cue ball against one or a plurality of object balls, so as to cause selected object balls to drop into specific peripheral pockets on the table. The sport of soccer has been popular for many years in Europe and South America. This outdoors sport is played on a field having two opposed goals at opposite ends of the field. The goals consist of enclosures with open mouths facing the field. The objective of a team of players is to kick or otherwise propel the ball, which is about the size and configuration of a basketball, into the goal of the opposing team. The game is played without the use of hands except for the single player stationed at each goal, known as the goalie, who may use any part of his body to block and prevent the entry of the ball into the goal and thus to prevent the opposing team from making a score. A popular indoors game played with a light weight, low density hollow ball is Ping-Pong, which is played on a horizontal table having a central transverse vertical net. Each of the two opposed players has a paddle to propel the Ping-Pong ball over the net. Points are made by hitting the ball over the net and onto the opposite side of the table in such a manner that the opponent cannot return the ball across the net into the opposite playing area after a single bounce. A popular indoors or outdoors sport played with a plurality of players i.e., a team, on each side, is hockey, typically ice or roller hockey, played by players having sticks provided with blades to propel a disc-shaped puck across the surface of the court and into the opponent&#39;s goal. The players move about on the court or field using ice skates or roller skates, as the case may be. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 1. Purposes of the Invention It is an object of the present invention to provide a novel indoors game which offers the players amusement and challenge. Another object is to provide an indoors game comparable in objective and arrangement to the outdoors game of soccer. A further object is to provide an indoors game which is fast in action and requires a combination of skill and chance to win. An additional object is to provide an exciting and amusing indoors game in which a low density projectile is propelled about on a table top having freely rotatable vertical baffles disposed thereon, the projectile being propelled about by at least two horizontal streams of air which are angularly directed across the table top against the moving projectile from nozzles controlled by the players, each player controlling the angular direction of a single nozzle. Still another object is to provide an improved indoors game in which the objective is to maneuver an air stream so as to deposit a low density ball or other projectile disposed on a table or the like into a pocket or other recess disposed on the opponent&#39;s side of the table. These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become evident from the description which follows. 2. Brief Description of the Invention In the present invention, an indoors air action game is provided which may be played by two or more players. The objective of the game is comparable to that of the outdoors sport of soccer, i.e., to propel a ball, disc or the like projectile into an opponent&#39;s goal. In the specific game described herein, the ball is propelled by air streams about and across a flat horizontal table top, each air stream being angularly directed by one of the players. A typical air stream velocity is on the order of 10 feet per second. The ball is light in weight and low in density, comparable to a Ping-Pong ball or a ball composed of foamed polyurethane or polyvinyl chloride plastic or the like. Typically the ball is of featherweight consistency, weighing e.g., 2 grams and having a diameter of about 1 inch. A foamed rubber ball may also be used in the game, but its action is somewhat sluggish. The table top is provided with walls on its outer sides or edges, which walls extend above the upper surface of the typically rectangular table so that the ball is not blown off the table top by the air streams. The air streams emanate from swiveled air stream guns, i.e., nozzles, or other means to project air streams horizontally across the upper surface of the table top from adjacent and above individual rear and side guarded pockets or recesses, which constitute goals. Each player is stationed at a single pocket or recess and controls a single swiveled air stream gun. To complete the game in its broadest and most general embodiment, a plurality of groups of freely rotatable vertical baffles are disposed on the upper surface of the table top. The air streams can rotate the baffles about different vertical axes for the different groups, in addition to propelling the ball about on the table top. The objective of the game is for a player to so maneuver his air stream gun as to play his air stream about on the upper surface of the table to accomplish the movement of the ball into his opponent&#39;s recess or pocket, i.e., the goal, and thereby make a score. At the same time the player attempts to defeat his opponent&#39;s efforts to deposit the ball in the player&#39;s goal. The preferable number of players is two, and, therefore, the preferable number of opposed recesses and associated swiveled means to project air substantially horizontally across the upper surface of the table top from above a recess is also two. The swiveled means to project an air stream from above a recess typically entails an air blower mounted below the table top, an electric motor or the like to rotate the blades or vanes of the air blower, a vertically oriented circular collar extending upwards through the table top at the rear of each recess, conduits to conduct an air stream to each collar from the blower, a transition tube extending upwards from the collar to a substantially horizontal air discharge nozzle above the recess, a mounting for the gun or collar that permits rotation of the gun about a vertical axis to provide swiveling action, and a lever to maneuver the nozzle in rotary fashion about said vertical axis. The extent of rotation of the nozzle will generally be over a semi-circular path, so that the horizontal air stream may be played into adjacent corners of the table top as well as directly forwards, at an angle, or angularly above the table top. The air discharge nozzle will preferably be non-circular so as to produce laminar rather than turbulent air flow. A preferred configuration for this tube is a trapezoidal cross-section with the long or wide side of the trapezoid downward adjacent to the table top, so as to propel most of the air stream directly across the table top immediately above the surface in a laminar flow. Other suitable configurations for the air discharge tube include a flat rectangular cross-section, with the longer axis parallel to the top surface of the table; and a flat horizontal base or bottom surmounted by a semi-circular top section. A foraminous enclosure is preferably provided at the sides and rear of each recess as a guard, to complete the analogy to the goal region of an outdoors soccer field. The rotatable vertical baffles on the table top are preferably disposed thereon as a plurality of individual unit clusters having a cruciform horizontal cross-section, with each individual unit being pivoted at its central vertical axis on a vertical pivot or spindle which extends upwards from the table top. A flat representative small human figure in the form and dress of a soccer player is desirably mounted on each side of each baffle, and a three-dimensional figure resembling a goalie is set astride the front end of the horizontal air discharge tube to complete the soccer game effect and illusion. The projectile, i.e., playing piece, may be composed of any of the materials mentioned supra and may be solid foamed material or may be hollow, such as Ping-Pong ball, however, the density or mass of the projectile contemplated in the present invention will be in most instances somewhat greater than that of the average Ping-Pong ball. It will be evident to those skilled in the art that the density, mass and/or dimension of the projectile will be correlated in each particular instance with the air stream velocity and/or volumetric flow rate, so that the projectile may be freely propelled about on the upper surface of the table without being lifted off the table. This correlation will of course be empirically determined for a particular game design, i.e., a smaller table, projectile and air flow rate or velocity for a child&#39;s game, and a larger table and projectile and greater air flow rate and velocity for the adult market. The projectile may be in any suitable shape or form, e.g., round like a ball, disc-shaped like a hockey puck, football-shaped, cubic, etc.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to a dental process and apparatus therefor. More specifically, this invention relates to a process for removing plaque from teeth by the application of heated water to the teeth and simultaneous brushing. The invention also relates to an apparatus including a handpiece for directing heated water to the teeth, as well as a rotary brush. A drive unit adapted to be powered by heated water is envisioned, a power shaft from the unit and part of the heated water exhaust being connected to the handpiece. 2. Description of the Related Art Including Information Disclosed Under §§1.97-1.99 This invention deals with dental plaque removal. Dental plaque is a colony of bacteria held together by viscid substances called glucans which also help anchor the bacteria to the teeth. Bacteria account for approximately 70 percent of the plaque mass. Glucans account for 20 percent, and levans, which act as energy sources, account for the remaining 10 percent. When the saliva comes in contact with the bare tooth enamel, a thin amorphous film mainly of glycoproteins rapidly forms on the surface of the tooth. Glycoproteins are molecules with a protein that is combined with carbohydrates. This film is called the acquired pellicle. The acquired pellicle is less than one micron in thickness. The actual bonding of the glycoproteins to the enamel cells is accomplished by means of electrostatic differences between the two. As an example, a protein with a negative charge could adhere to a positive receptor site on the tooth surface, while a molecule with a negative charge would adhere to a site on the tooth surface that had a positive charge. At this initial stage, the acquired pellicle had no colonies of bacteria. The dental plaque attaches itself to the acquired pellical proteins by interactions similar to the attachment of the proteins to the bare tooth enamel; that is, by means of electrostatic differences between the pellicle and the bacterial wall and the glucans. Colonization of the pellical by the bacteria signals the formation of dental plaque. By means of electrostatic charges the bacterial cells adhere to the pellicle, cell walls of other bacteria or glucans making up the intercellular matrix of the plaque. In the prior art processes for removal of dental plaque have involved the physical scraping of the teeth. Scraping coupled with ultrasonics and water spray has also been used. Apparatus for treating the teeth in the past have taken various forms. Generally pertinent to the apparatus of the invention are various water-driven devices for brushing the teeth. Examples are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,283,314, which issued May 19, 1942 to J. L. Ckola. Such devices have included water-driven turbines, located directly in or on the handpiece, and a brush at the opposite end of the handpiece. In some cases, water from the turbine has been delivered to the brush. Other examples are U.S. Pat. No. 3,909,867, which issued Oct. 7, 1975 to Hogsell; U.S. Pat. No. 4,257,433, which issued Mar. 24, 1981 to Kwan; U.S. Pat. No. 4,336,622, which issued June 29, 1982 to Teague, Jr. et al. (Copies of these patents are attached in accordance with 37 CFR 1.97-1.99.) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The process of the invention is the application of heated water to the teeth with simultaneous brushing. Temperatures of above 40° C. are contemplated, the range of 40° C. to 50° C. being preferred. The dental plaque is a product of millions of years of evolution at 98.6° F. (37° C.). I have discovered the plaque matrix is severely traumatized and weakened with the application of heated water substantially above 98.6° F. I have also discovered that the application of heated water to the binding sites of the acquired pellicle and the tooth enamel as well as the binding sites of the plaque to the pellicle weakens the binding attraction by means of the heat increasing the vibration of the molecules. This increase in vibration and the decrease in binding properties results in more efficient cleansing of plaque and pellicle alike when the application of heated water is accompanied by simultaneous brushing. The physical chemistry phenomenon of heated water on binding sites is clear. However, the biological effects of heated water on plaque is not exactly known. The heated water breakdown of the dental plaque matrix is a function of severe environmental alteration of temperature. The device described herein provides simultaneous brushing and application of heated water to the site to be cleaned. By means of physical chemistry phenomenon associated with the observed effect of heated water of approximately the 40° C. to 50° C. range, the plaque and pellicle have a tendency to slide from their binding sites more readily and therefore brushing is made inherently more efficacious. It is especially important to brush simultaneously with the bath of heated water, because plaque colonies have an inherent protective mechanism that has evolved whereby heated liquids and foods cannot destroy plaque colonies due to the protective insulative effects of multiple layers of bacterial cells. The plaque colonies must be dispersed and disturbed by brushing simultaneously with heated water rinsing in order for the invention to work properly. Aside from the removal of plaque the process of the invention dilutes out sugars in the mouth because of the heavy rinsing with water. Another benefit of the heated water bath is the engorgement of the gingiva with blood upon the application of heat. This general engorgement of tissues when heat is applied is especially important, because the gingiva fluid flow rate is increased as the gingiva presses against the tooth surface. The increase exudate is brushed away simultaneously. The apparatus of the invention is a handpiece providing a rotary brush and a nozzle directed toward the brush. Spaced from the handpiece and adapted to be positioned in the bathroom sink is a rotary water-driven power unit. Means are provided to deliver heated water from the faucet to the unit to drive an impeller thereinside, and a flexible drive shaft and heated water conduit connects the power unit and the handpiece. Other objects and features of the invention will be apparent from the following specification including drawings, all of which disclose a non-limiting form of the invention.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to farrowing crates and in particular farrowing crates that allow for a range of motion by the sow. 2. Description of the Prior Art It is well established that sows during the lactation period can and do crush piglets. Various methods have been proposed to constrain the movement of the sow during that period so as to reduce the frequency of crushing deaths of the piglets. Specifically, rectangular farrowing crates were developed to restrict the movement of the sow during parturition and lactation. The rectangular farrowing crates are designed so that the sow cannot turn around thereby severely restricting the movement of the sows. In some instances the sow also has difficulty with the smooth completion of the lying-down and getting-up action. These types of farrowing crates are commonly used by pig farmers. The rectangular crates are now gaining a certain amount of notoriety, particularly among the animal rights/welfare proponents. The major problem with the rectangular farrowing crate is that the crate is not large enough to permit the sow to turn around 360°. The ability of the sow to turn around: a) permits physical exercise so that the sow can maintain muscle strength and general health; b) permits easier expression of vacuum nest-building activities before farrowing; c) enlarges the sow-piglet interaction zone, facilitating snout-snout contact between the sow and piglets; d) eases frustration resulting from the inability to visually inspect unexpected external stimuli such as piglets&#39; squealing or sudden noises; and e) increase environmental complexity, thereby reducing boredom and boredom-related vices. A more ergonomic model of a farrowing crate which allows for circling was developed which has an ellipsoid shape. This design is described in An Ellipsoid Farrowing Crate: Its Ergonomic Design and Effects on Pig Productivity, Zhensheng Lou and J. Frank Hurnik, The Journal of Animal Science, 1994:72, p2610 -2616.The main features of this carte are its oval or ellipsoid horizontal frame and the bowed vertical bars. The bowed vertical bars are uniformly shaped. The width of the ellipsoid crate at the lower rail which connects the lower end portions of the vertical bars is greater than the distance between the front and hind legs of the sow but less than the total length of the sow. The width of the ellipsoid crate at the middle portion of the vertical bars is greater than the length of the sow. Thus the ellipsoid crate allows the sow to turn but it does not allow the sow to lie down unless she is positioned along the length of the ellipsoid crate. There are a number of advantages of this crate since it allows for the sow to turn around. However, the ellipsoid farrowing crate uses more space than the generally accepted rectangular farrowing crate and there are portions of the ellipsoid farrowing crate which are considered to be wasted space. Therefore it is desirable to provide a farrowing crate that allows the sow to turn around 360° but which occupies essentially the amount of space of the rectangular farrowing crate. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to farrowing crates which allows a sow to turn around 360°. The farrowing crate of the present invention has front and back portions which have top and bottom rails having an arcuate section and a straight longitudinal section. Front and back portions also have bowed bars which extend between top and bottom rails and which vary in curvature along the length of the front and back portions. The farrowing crate of the present invention is for use inside a typical 5 by 7 foot (approximately 150 by 210 cm) rectangular pen. The farrowing crate comprises an end support, an opposed end support, a back portion and a front portion. The back portion is releasably attached at one end to end support and at the other end to opposed end support. Back portion has a top rail spaced from a bottom rail and a plurality of spaced apart bowed bars therebetween. The front portion is releasably attached at one end to end support and at the other end to opposed end support member. Front portion has a top rail spaced from a bottom rail and a plurality of spaced apart bowed bars therebetween. Top and bottom rail for both front and back portions, each have an arcuate section and a straight longitudinal section. The curvature of bowed bars varies such that the curvature of bowed bars increases as the bars approach the arcuate section and the curvature of bowed bars decreases as the bars approach end support member and opposed end support member. Further features of the invention will be described or will become apparent in the course of the following detailed description.",

With these tools and through experience gained through the years, focus has been on making these cue signals fit specific events while improving the animal&#39;s acceptance in learning its tasks more easily. This experience has been predominately been with dogs; although the application of such devices are not specifically limited only to dogs. During this evolution, manufacturers offered users the capability to select different levels of cue signals at a given moment from a hand-held transmitter to the dog&#39;s collar at a distance and from one to over one hundred different levels. From this vantage, what has been learned is that one level is not always the appropriate level. Rather, many levels are useful and depend upon the temperament and distraction level of each individual dog at any given moment. It is advantageous to have the means to quickly adjust the level to match the dog&#39;s current focus. Yet, even a selector dial with many levels to select from may not be enough as the available levels may not properly match the dog&#39;s adrenal releases and distractions. Therefore a device was needed which provides incremental gradual levels that can be quickly adjusted just as the volume control in ones car radio—fitting the individual&#39;s hearing quality while overcoming background noise levels. In this manner, the device&#39;s output needs to finitely change to match the dog&#39;s adrenaline and background distractions at any given moment and at appropriate distances. Not only to go up in level but to instantly come down in level, therein never overwhelming the dog or causing any over reactions by the dog. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a remote controller for animal training including a remote controller held by a user and a training device worn by an animal coupled by radio frequency (RF) communication. The remote controller has a stimulation mode selection button, a control for setting the level of electrical impulse stimulation to be applied to the animal which includes a three-terminal potentiometer for volume control. A voltage-to-frequency converter converts a voltage level set by the volume control to a corresponding frequency signal proportional to the voltage level. RF communication circuitry transmits signals including the kind and mode of stimuli and the level of electrical impulse stimulation to the training device through a transmitting antenna. Additional features are selectively contemplated including a buzzer and an LED on the training device controlled by the remote controller. Battery charge status of the power sources on the two devices are contemplated for the remote controller. A GPS locator and a detachable antenna are also contemplated. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved animal training device. Other and further objects and advantages will become apparent from the following description.",

    "abstract": "Background: Laurel Oak is native to coastal plain and piedmont areas from southern New Jersey to Florida to east Texas and Southeast Arkansas. It thrives in the heat and humidity of the Southeast and can be found in established dune areas, scrub oak sandhills, stream banks and occasionally in mixed woods. Laurel Oak prefers moist, well-drained soils in these areas but adapt readily to harsh conditions. This species is typically pyramidal-rounded with ultimate height of 40 to 60 feet and spread of 30 to 40 feet. My new cultivar differs from the species in that it is asexually reproduced, has a compact habit with dense canopy, dominant central leader, fibrous root system, vigorous growth rate, and shiny, rich, dark green foliage in summer and holding onto leaves until spring. The ultimate height and width of ‘QHMTF’ is not known. I expect my new variety of Laurel Oak to perform as well as the species. Industry Representation: Cultivated Laurel Oak is predominately represented in the industry by seedling material reproduced by acorn. This accounts for a high degree of variability in the industry, both in the landscape industry and nursery. Seedling Laurel Oak (including ‘Darlington’) is variable in growth rate and habit, typically does not have a central leader, has a sparse, shallow root system, and tends to be open in youth. At time of submission, I am not aware of any other commercially available cultivar Laurel Oak. ‘QHMTF’ has a compact habit with dense canopy, dominant central leader, fibrous root system, vigorous growth rate, shiny, rich, dark green foliage in summer and holding onto leaves until spring along; it is the only known  Quercus hemisphaerica  reproduced from softwood cuttings. These genetic traits can be consistently reproduced by asexual propagation which makes my selection uniquely different from seedling Laurel Oak (including ‘Darlington’) at time of submittal. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS The accompanying photographs depict the color of the tree and foliage of my new variety as nearly as is reasonably possibly to make the same in a color illustration of this character. FIG. 1  is a photograph of the original parent ‘QHMTF’ variety from which the progeny are derived taken in the summer at seven years of age and four inch caliper at an observation area showing form and habit; FIG. 2  is a field row photograph of the progeny in the fall at four years of age with each tree showing a dominant central leader and variations in fall color; FIG. 3  is a photograph of the interior canopy of the progeny at four years of age showing a dominant central leader; FIG. 4  is a photograph of the bark of the progeny taken at five inch caliper and seven years of age showing color and smoothness of my new variety; FIG. 5  is a field row shot of progeny taken at 5 inch caliper and seven years of age with each tree showing a dominant central leader, and FIG. 6  is a photograph of the shiny, dark green foliage of the progeny at seven years of age.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to tissue extraction devices, and more particularly to a hand-held device for extracting tissue samples by needle aspiration which utilizes a disposable cannula assembly. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Biopsy devices utilizing needle aspiration to extract tissue samples are well known to those skilled in the art. Such devices are extremely useful to obtain samples of tissue suspected of being cancerous so that such tissue may be examined in order to confirm such suspected diagnosis. Such devices are frequently used when sampling suspected cancerous tissue in the lungs, breasts, and prostate, as well as other body organs. Numerous other applications have also been found for these devices. Generally, such biopsy instruments extract a sample of tissue from a tissue mass by either drawing a tissue sample into a hollow needle via an external vacuum force or by severing and containing a tissue sample within a notch formed on a stylet. Typical of such devices utilizing a vacuum force are U.S. Pat. No. 5,246,011 issued to Cailouette and U.S. Pat. No. 5,183,052 issued to Terwilliger. Such devices contemplate the use of advancing a hollow needle into a tissue mass and applying a vacuum force to draw a sample into the needle and hold the same therein while the tissue is extracted. Such devices, however, fail to adequately sever and contain such tissue samples as the vacuum force may not be sufficiently strong enough to sever and hold the sample within the biopsy needle. Alternatively, other prior art biopsy instruments alternatively utilize a biopsy needle with a tissue sample recovery notch formed thereon to extract a specimen, such as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,477,423 issued to Griffith, often referred to as the TRU-CUT needle and U.S. Pat. No. 4,776,346 issued to Beraha et al. Such devices, however, have the drawback of not effectively drawing a tissue sample of sufficient size into the biopsy notch on the cannula. Accordingly, such samples extracted by such biopsy needles may not provide sufficient tissue to perform an examination and thus require additional biopsies to be taken. Additionally, such needles have the disadvantage of having to be advanced into the desired tissue site such that the needle may possibly extend beyond the tissue site, thus resulting in the recovery of an inaccurate or non-usable tissue sample or injury to adjacent organs or structures by over-penetration. Further attempts in the art have tried using specially designed cannulas to enhance the cutting and recovery of tissue samples as well as combining the application of a vacuum force to draw in a tissue sample into a biopsy cavity and then cutting the tissue contained therein. U.S. Pat. No. 4,708,147 issued to Haaga discloses a cannula for a biopsy needle designed to cut a sample of tissue and then applying a vacuum to the cannula such that the tissue is drawn into the cannula and thus retained therein for recovery. Additionally, U.S. Pat. No. 3,844,272 issued to Banko discloses a biopsy device wherein a suction force, created by a vacuum, draws a sample of tissue into a receiving compartment whereby two coaxial members are rotated relative to each other so that the members essentially coact to cut off the specimen and place it into a compartment. Such combination devices, however, fail to either sufficiently isolate a sample or fail to draw in a sample of sufficient size into a biopsy compartment. Additionally, such instruments typically are difficult to maneuver and manipulate and are not necessarily accurate or effective enough to achieve their desired purpose. Accordingly, there exists a substantial need in the art to provide a tissue sample extractor capable of effectively and efficiently drawing in a suitable sample of tissue and isolating the tissue sample within the biopsy instrument. Additionally, there is a need for a biopsy device that is easy to use and can effectively be manipulated by one hand in light of the fact that it is advantageous to perform such biopsy procedures wherein the physician user is allowed to have an additional free hand. Furthermore, there is need in the art to provide a tissue sample extractor that not-only provides tissue samples of sufficient size, but allows the user to take multiple tissue samples without having to repeatedly puncture and penetrate the tissue mass. Further, it would be of even greater advantage to provide a tissue sample extractor having the above-mentioned features and also utilizing a disposable cannula assembly. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention specifically addresses and alleviates the above-mentioned deficiencies associated with the art. More particularly, the present invention comprises a tissue sample needle core biopsy needle specifically designed to allow the physician user to extract a sample of tissue in an effective and efficient manner while only requiring the user to use one hand to operate the device. The device comprises a first cannula having a specifically configured, sharpened, and beveled cutting tip and biopsy reservoir formed at its distal end wherein the biopsy reservoir is formed proximal to the cutting tip. The first cannula is attachable to a conventional syringe such that the biopsy reservoir is in fluid communication with the barrel piston of the syringe. Axially mounted about the first cannula is a second cutting cannula, preferably having a sharpened cutting edge formed about its distal end and a shoulder attached to its proximal end. The second cannula is designed and configured to axially telescope relative the first cannula such that the second cannula selectively covers and uncovers the distal end of the first cannula. Disposed between the proximal ends of the first cannula and second cannula is a biasing member, preferably a spring, which urges the second cutting cannula to advance axially toward the distal end of the first cannula. The syringe, the coaxially positioned first and second cannulas, and biasing member are preferably mountable within a hand-held introducer. Preferably, the introducer is comprised of two parts, namely a handle and syringe retainer as well as a plunger retractor member. The handle, syringe retainer, and plunger retractor member preferably cooperate to form a gun-like structure that is easy to grasp and manipulate with one hand. The handle and syringe retainer portion includes a grippable handle and means for retaining the syringe on the syringe retainer. The plunger retractor member includes a C-shaped member designed and configured to engage the plunger of the syringe. Additionally, the plunger retractor member includes a trigger-shaped member depending therefrom to enhance the grippability and function of the extractor. Furthermore, the plunger retractor member includes a cam bar that is pivotally attached to a tip portion of the C-shaped member. The cam bar is preferably provided with a first cam slot and a second cam abutment surface sized and configured to selectively control the axial position of the second cannula about the first cannula. The second cannula is preferably attached to a shoulder at its proximal end that is specifically designed and configured to engage the first cam slot and second cam abutment surface. When the shoulder is engaged with the first cam slot, the distal end of the second cannula is maintained in a distal axial position wherein the second cannula covers the biopsy reservoir formed on the first cannula but leaves the cutting tip of the first cannula exposed. When the shoulder is allowed to advance to the second cam abutment surface, the second cannula is maintained in a distal axial position wherein the distal end of the second cannula extends just beyond the biopsy channnel of the first cannula. Additionally, the shoulder may be released altogether from the cam bar whereby the first cannula may be withdrawn from the second cannula while maintaining the second cannula resident in the patient. Such selective withdrawal of the first cannula enables multiple biopsies to be effectuated without multiple punctures of the patient&#39;s tissue mass to enhance the ability to remove multiple samples with one puncture. The cannula assembly may be rotated to position the biopsy channel a full range of 360 degrees without the need to rotate the handle. In order to facilitate the selective axial positioning of the second cannula relative the first cannula, the introducer is preferably provided with a spring-activated detent or locking member and a plurality of locking apertures. Preferably, the locking member is disposed upon the handle and syringe retainer while the locking apertures are formed upon the plunger retractor member. Accordingly, the interconnection between the locking member and a respective aperture advantageously maintains the desired axial positions of the second cannula relative the first cannula whereby the second cannula is controllably axially telescoped about the first cannula. Importantly, this interconnection detachably maintains the second cannula in a distal and a proximal axial position wherein the second cannula is axially retracted about the biopsy reservoir of the first cannula. Such exposure of the biopsy reservoir via reciprocation of the second cannula from a distal position covering the biopsy channel to a proximal position and back to distal position coupled with vacuum ultimately enables a sample to be extracted by the extractor of the present invention. Optionally, the shoulder moves along a guide which restricts lateral movement thereof so as to ensure that the shoulder, and consequently the second cannula, move only longitudinally, i.e., directly toward the patient, during actuation of the device. The guide thus prevents bending of the cannula assembly, particularly in an upward direction, as has been found to be common during use of such devices. The guide preferably comprises an elongate member having a channel formed therein such that the shoulder slides along the channel in a manner which prevents undesirable bending of the cannula assembly. Thus, the guide effectively prevents side-to-side and upward bending of the first biopsy cannula and the second cutting cannula. According to the preferred embodiment of the present invention the shoulder is configured as a disk, but may be of various other configurations, and the guide comprises a complimentary channel along which the shoulder moves as the shoulder urges the second cutting cannula to distally advance about the first biopsy cannula. The beveled cutting tip of the first biopsy cannula preferably comprises a solid plug having a scalloped portion defining the sharpened bevel thereof. The scalloped portion is preferably, but not necessarily, formed via electron discharge machining, e.g., either standard or wire electron discharge machining. The diameter of the solid plug of the beveled cutting tip of the first cannula is preferably either approximately equal to the outer diameter of the first biopsy cannula or it is approximately equal to the outer diameter of the second cutting cannula. Thus, the beveled cutting tip is configured to facilitate easy insertion of the cannula assembly into tissue. The solid plug is preferably attached to the first biopsy cannula prior to forming the scalloped portion therein so as to provide a convenient means for handling the solid plug. Alternatively, the solid plug may be formed at the end of an elongate solid bar member and subsequently cut therefrom prior to insertion into the first biopsy cannula. The beveled cutting tip is preferably attached to the first biopsy cannula via at least one of press fitting and crimping. Those skilled-in the art will appreciate that various other different means for attaching the beveled cutting tip to the first biopsy cannula are likewise suitable. For example, thermal or electrical welding, adhesive bonding, or the use of various different mechanical fasteners may be utilized. The biopsy reservoir preferably comprises an obstructing member for preventing the vacuum from pulling a tissue sample from the biopsy reservoir. The obstructing member preferably comprises an inwardly bent tab formed from the first biopsy cannula at a proximal portion of the periphery of the biopsy reservoir.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to check valves and in particular to a latched valve used to maintain a preferred suspension pressure at a prosthetic socket or interface between a limb and a prosthesis, among other applications. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The maintenance of a negative pressure or suction in a prosthetic socket or at a related interface to thereby facilitate a desired limb suspension is typically achieved through the use of an expulsion-type check valve (e.g. auto, manual or both). Such valves are typically configured to provide a threaded base or seat. The base, in turn, normally supports a threaded valve insert that is configured to ensure a proper airtight seal. Proper placement of the valve insert relative to the base requires a high degree of dexterity and hand-eye coordination, especially when used in a prosthetic limb. That is, most typically the valve base is located at the most distal aspect of a limb socket. The base is typically thermoformed or laminated into the socket. Such a location can be difficult to see, but can also present an awkward relative alignment angle to mount or detach the valve insert. Because the valve threads, which exhibit a relatively fine pitch, have to line up perfectly in order for the valve insert to be set properly, the combination of poor visibility and high demands for physical dexterity typically result in difficult donning situations for individuals with sound hands and fingers. Removal of the valve can present similar challenges, as the quality of the seal is often related to how tight the insert has been screwed into the valve base. A significant amount of friction can result from overzealous tightening of the valve insert, making it extremely difficult to remove. For individuals with an involved upper extremity or extremities (e.g. injured, deformed, diseased or the result of insufficient congenital development), the insertion and/or removal of the valve insert from the valve seat can prove impossible. This circumstance is particularly onerous for the debilitated user who has to periodically self-adjust the limb. The foregoing difficulties have been overcome with the present valve assembly, which provides a base that is adapted to receive a mating, latched insert. The valve assembly at the coupling junction between the base and insert is particularly constructed to provide for a latched connection. The interconnection provides a sliding, sealed valve insert piece that is respectively pushed or pulled from the seat or base during mounting and removal. The connection is maintained or broken with cooperating latch arms that assure proper insert retention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is a primary object of the present invention to provide a threadless valve assembly wherein a valve base or seat supports a mating, latched insert that supports a valve piece. It is a further object of the invention to provide a valve assembly having a base containing a bore that accepts a slide mounted latching insert. It is a further object of the invention to provide a valve assembly wherein an O&#39;ring seals a valve insert within a seat bore. It is a further object of the invention to provide a resiliently biased valve piece that is sealed within the valve insert. It is a further object of the invention to provide a latched interconnection between the valve base or seat and the latched insert. The foregoing objects are achieved in a presently preferred construction of the invention and valve assembly, which includes a threadless valve base and a threadless valve insert. The threadless insert is pushed into the valve base by hand or using a tool or other appliance that imparts sufficient pressure on the valve insert to overcome an internal resilient tension and seal friction. The valve base and valve insert include overlapping, annular flange surfaces. An O&#39;ring seals the insert within the base. A concentric, resiliently biased valve piece is retained in the insert with a second O&#39;ring. Resiliently biased latch arms are mounted to the insert and located to pivot during insert insertion and extraction. Flanged latch surfaces at the arms flex outward during insertion and spring back to a concentric, restraining alignment with the base upon traversing an interconnecting annular flange at the base. During insert removal, portions of the latch arms are depressed and pivoted to disconnect the arms from the base. The insert can then be removed, which action is facilitated if the insert is independently biased with other resilient devices (e.g. springs) fitted between the insert and base. Although two latch arms are symmetrically arranged to the present base, a single latch arm or other arrangements of arms can be used. A plunger-type valve piece is used to allow auto or manual expulsion of air or other gas or liquid from the limb socket, although other types and mountings of the valve piece can also be adapted to the insert. Similarly, the valve piece might be latched to the insert in a related manner with latch arms or other threadless restraints. Although the present valve assembly finds particular application with prosthetic limbs, it is to be appreciated the valve might be used in other applications. Still other objects, advantages and constructions of the present invention, among various considered improvements and modifications, will become apparent from the detailed description provided hereinafter. It should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating a presently preferred embodiment of the invention, are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention.",

    "abstract": "The present invention is generally related to beverage cooling apparatuses, and more particularly to a device for cooling wine bottles and other beverage containers. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION This invention provides a means of efficiently, sanitarily and conveniently chilling, refrigerating or storing bottles or beverage containers that are best when stored or served cold. The conventional placement method to either chill, refrigerate or store bottles or beverage containers is to place the bottle or beverage container itself, directly in the refrigerator or an ice maker or ice bin. The method of placing a bottle or beverage container in a residential ice maker or commercial ice bin is usually complicated due to the fact that the bottle or beverage container becomes slippery when wet and the bottle or beverage container labels typically fall off or begin to disintegrate into the ice bin area when left for any length of time, no matter how brief. When the labels come off in a residential ice maker bin or commercial ice bin, the end result is that particles of the label sink to the bottom of the bin and clog the ice maker or ice bin drainage line, thus resulting in a water removal problem since the water from melting ice stays in the ice bin and ultimately overflows onto the floor or some other area. A plumber must then be called to unclog the drainage line and any damage to the floor or cabinet area must be repaired. Another problem is that the bottles or beverage containers typically sink to the bottom of the ice bins and must then be located and retrieved in the sanitized ice either by someone&#39;s hand or by some other instrument. When placing bottles or beverage containers in an ice bin for commercial purposes, such as a bar or restaurant situation, the bottles or beverage containers are placed in the ice bin that also provides ice for the drinks by its patrons. This situation provides the opportunity for a bottle or beverage container to get broken in the ice bin when another bottle or beverage container is slammed into the ice after a drink has been poured. It also provides an extremely unsanitary situation by contaminating the sanitized ice since these bottles or beverage containers are handled by numerous people, are not cleaned off every time they are removed from the ice before being placed back into the ice bin and are typically stored in the same ice bin that provides the ice utilized for patrons drinks. The commercial ice bin in which the bottles and beverage containers are placed or stored is rarely separated from the ice used in the patron glasses. When most bottles are placed in a residential refrigeration unit after opening, such as wine, the bottle is usually too tall to stand upright in the refrigerator once the cork has been replaced in the bottle after opening. The bottle is usually laid on its side in the refrigerator, resulting in the bottle dripping liquid on the shelves of the refrigerator due to a poor seal from the cork being reinserted into the open bottle. This cylindrical receptacle provides a convenient, sanitary, organized, effective method, whether for residential or commercial use, for the complete or partial storage or placement of a beverage container(s) or bottle(s) that is best when served cold or chilled. It is an objective of the invention to provide a sanitary and effective means to place or store beverage containers and bottles in ice makers, ice bins, ice chests, or in refrigerated units. It is also an objective of the invention to provide a receptacle that will cool or chill beverage containers or bottles in an organized fashion while aiding in the elimination of breakage or spilled liquids. It is another objective of the invention to provide an inexpensive chilling or storing receptacle to be utilized in an ice bin for beverage containers or bottles. The present invention achieves technical advantages as a convenient beverage cooling device adapted to be placed in a cooling chamber, such as a freezer, or even integrally forced into the cooling chamber to cool a beverage container without allowing the beverage container to get wet.",

The inner positioner has low pressure and is not sufficient alone to support the leg. The inner positioner has little or no flow characteristics unless an outside force is applied other than gravity. The inner positioner can displace and contour three-dimensionally as though it was fluid to the sides and top of the leg while not having flow characteristics that would result in migration of the medium under the force of gravity. The inner positioner can provide three-dimensional contouring to the Achilles tendon. The inner positioner can include a temperature regulating material for keeping the leg in an optimal range of skin temperature to keep the leg comfortable longer. The inner positioner can be shaped as a pad to mold to the underside portion of the lower leg and heel. Alternatively, the inner positioner can include various shapes to support the lower leg and heel. In one embodiment, the inner positioner also includes a portion which extends over a top portion of the leg (shin). The system can also include an outer support which is received over the inner positioner. The outer support can be in the shape of an open boot. The outer support can include an ultra low pressure plenum. The ultra low pressure plenum is filled at a predetermined low pressure for distributing pressure along the length of the outer support, but not providing significant elevation of the lower leg and heel by itself. The ultra low pressure plenum will not support the lower leg and heel unless the ultra low outer support is closed around the lower leg and heel. In this embodiment, the inner positioner is partially filled with the fluidized particulate material so it cannot support a leg on its own. For example, the inner positioner can be filled up to ⅔ of its capacity. The inner support provides three-dimensional contouring to the supported lower leg and heel. The outer portion of the inner positioner contours to the inner portion of the ultra low pressure plenum for providing more gas displacement of the outer support than if the inner positioner was not present. In one embodiment the system is strapless. In an alternate embodiment, the system includes a strap for attachment of the outer support to the leg. The strap can be sufficiently wide and cushioned to protect the skin. In one embodiment, the strap is air bearing. In one embodiment, a rear end of the outer support includes a gate, which can be opened to allow access to the foot and heel from the rear of the boot. When the outer support is fully opened, the outer support is in a flat position to provide a treatment area without lifting of the leg. The inner positioner or outer support can include a fluidized thermal regulating medium. In one embodiment, a phase change material can be used for adjusting the temperature of the system. The system of the present invention can be a one size fits all and adapts to the size and shape of a patient&#39;s leg. The system maintains neutral alignment and helps prevent foot drop. The system gently but securely wraps the leg, helping to maintain constant heel position. The system promotes proper dorsiflexion without causing undue pressure on the lower limb. The combination of the inner positioner including a fluidized medium along with the outer support including a ultra low pressure plenum creates sufficient support of the lower leg while responding to normal patient movement. The combination of the inner positioner and the outer support provides three-dimensional contouring to the lower leg and heel for micro adjustment while the outer support or boot is closed for minimizing friction and shear. This is not possible in conventional devices having the disadvantage that the inner chamber is not free to communicate with the leg without negatively affecting the functionality of the outer chamber. In general, the custom fitting protection can be used in such a way as to elevate the foot without “locking out the knee” due to three-dimensional molding and provide comfort to the skin. The natural contour of the leg can be maintained while eliminating harmful pressure to the heel, ankle, Achilles and foot. The system of the present invention can respond to the twisting of the leg without causing movement of the outer support. The system of the present invention can minimize shear forces that would be associated with a non-fluidized medium. The invention will be more fully described by reference to the following drawings.",

The user moves a knob that causes the collection of used floss onto a collecting spool. The advancing mechanism maintains the tension on the floss while the floss is being advanced, so when the user stops advancing the floss, the floss is at the proper tension for flossing without any further intervention by the user. The flossing apparatus of the present invention preferably has separate cartridges containing the dispensing spool and the collecting spool respectively. The dispensing spool preferably has a curved brake means that engages the dispensing spool to provide generally continuous tension as the floss is dispensed. These cartridges are preferably interchangeable, so the dispensing spool when empty can be put in the place of the collecting spool. The brake in the cartridge would be engaged when the cartridge was used as a dispensing cartridge and not engaged when the cartridge was used as a collection spool.

    "abstract": "This invention relates to electrocautery surgical instruments and more particularly to an electrocautery scalpel system having variably extendable suction and electrode elements to facilitate electrocautery surgery at deep locations within surrounding tissue. Electrocautery instruments commonly rely upon high-voltage, high-frequency electrical signals of various waveforms to selectively sever, clamp or coagulate living tissue during surgical procedures. In addition, many such electrocautery instruments include integral vacuum conduits and associated suction apparatus for evacuating tissue fluids and volatized tissue materials that commonly accompany electrocautery incision of living tissue. Devices of these types are disclosed in the literature (see, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,311,494; 1,963,636; 2,002,594; 2,894,512; 3,662,151; 3,682,162; 3,828,780; 3,835,842; 3,850,175; 3,884,237; 3,902,494; 3,906,955; 3,974,833; 3,987,795; 4,011,872; 4,112,950; and 4,562,838; and French Patent No. 73.30854). Electrocautery instruments of these types also commonly employ a retractable electrode or a vacuum port to enhance the utility of the instrument during surgical procedures. One difficulty encountered with certain electrocautery scalpels having extendable and retractable electrodes is that the geometry of the instruments usually limits the depth in tissue to which the instruments can conveniently penetrate without expanding the incision to accommodate the surgeon&#39;s hand. As certain surgical procedures progress and penetrate deeper into a surgical site, it is frequently desirable to extend the instrument to longer dimension with control over the retractable electrode in order to facilitate advancing the surgery into deep, confined sites. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, an improved electrocautery surgical instrument includes a retractable electrode and a vacuum conduit for selectively evacuating a surgical site, and also includes attachable extension units of various lengths for selectively extending the operational utility of the instrument as a surgical procedure progresses. The vacuum port and slidable electrode/blade of the instrument are thereby extended a selected dimension to facilitate deep surgical procedures in confined sites. Safety switching is included within the instrument to control application of high-voltage electrical signals to the electrode/blade and to permit the user to establish electrically inactive conditions during attachment and removal of extension units. The electrocautery surgical instrument thus configured according to the present invention facilitates surgical procedures in deep surgical sites as well as in shallow surgical sites without having to replace the instrument in the surgeon&#39;s hand during the surgical procedure.",

    "abstract": "This invention is concerned (1) with the production of antigens for the purpose of active immunization, (2) with the antigens so produced, and (3) with the use of said antigens. More particularly, the invention relates to antigens consisting of natural protein reproductive hormones, non-hormonal proteins, specific fragments of such hormones and proteins and synthetically derived portions of said hormones and proteins, all modified as will be indicated more fully hereinafter. For the sake of simplicity, hereinafter in this specification and in the claims, these antigens are collectively referred to as modified polypeptides. The invention is directed in one aspect to the use of modified polypeptides in actively immunizing an animal, particularly mammals, against the biological action of endogenous unmodified non-hormonal natural protein and/or hormone. The state of immunity arises because of the creation of antibodies which act against both the antigenic modified polypeptide and its endogenous counterpart which is neutralized (rendered biologically ineffectual) as a result of the existence of said antibodies. The immunity may take place because of the inability of the antibody to distinguish between the modified polypeptide and the naturally existing protein, but it is uncertain that this is in fact the situation. In effect, the invention provides, in one aspect, for the isoimmunization of a primate animal. A more specific aspect of this invention relates to the modification of protein reproductive hormones by adding certain numbers of foreign moieties to each hormone molecule, or hormonal fragment. The modification must be sufficient to cause the body to create antibodies to the modified hormones which will neutralize or inhibit the biological action of the natural hormones produced by the body. Thus, the modified hormones become antigenic and cause the production of antibodies which disrupt the natural processes of conception and/or gestation. The term &#34;protein reproductive hormones&#34; includes those hormones essential to the normal events of the reproductive process. According to a further aspect of this invention, a disease state which can be treated by application of the technique of the instant invention is the digestive disorder known to those skilled in the medical field as the Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome. This syndrome or disease state is generally described as a condition in which a hyper secretion of the polypeptide gastrin, which is produced in the pancreas and brings about a state of hyperacidity in the stomach which results in a chronic digestive disorder. Heretofore, the only effective treatment for this disease state was the surgical removal of a part or total removal of the subject&#39;s stomach. Although survival of such patients is usually not threatened, the medical state and life style of such individuals is severely affected by such treatment. Treatment of such subjects with hapten coupled (produced according to the general method described herein) or otherwise chemically modified gastrin can be used to enhance the production of antibodies against the hypersecretion of gastrin and thereby alleviate or reduce the symptoms of this disease without surgical intervention. Sufficient reduction by immunological means of this substance in the system of the body would be sufficient to avoid the complicated and serious consequences of the surgical treatment currently in use. In practice, an effective amount of modified gastrin is simply injected into the patient as required to accomplish the control of the flow or presence of gastrin. Another serious medical problem which is treatable by the application of the technique of the instant invention is that of hypertension. In general terms, the state of hypertension is the abnormal level or fluctuation of one&#39;s blood pressure. The blood pressure in an individual is controlled by many physiological processes in the body. However, one major substance effecting the regulation of such pressure is the hormonal polypeptide known as angiotension II. In certain states of high blood pressure (hypertension) it is difficult to medically control the secretion and therefore the level of angiotension II in the circulatory system. By the appropriate modification of this hormone and subsequent immunization with this altered modified proteinaceous hormone, it is possible to reduce the secretion of angiotension II in patients with chronically elevated hormone levels. The predictable and controlled reduction of this substance is beneficial to certain patients with chronic problems of hypertension. Modified angiotension II can be produced by the general protein modification technique described herein. The resultant modified angiotension II is simply injected into the patient in an amount sufficient to induce antibody response sufficient to control or regulate unmodified angiotension II to the desired degree. A further embodiment of the present invention is the treatment of diabetes and associated micro and macro vascular diseases. Currently, the treatment of diabetes is limited to dietary and/or drug treatment to regulate blood glucose levels. Recent scientific data support the concept that growth hormone and somatomedian (both polypeptides) are intimately involved in the disease syndrome. These substances can be modified by the technique described herein and used in an effective amount to control the progress of this disease. In practice, modified growth hormone or modified somatomedian is injected into the body to develop antibodies for control of the normally secreted hormones. Another health problem that can be treated by the use of the concepts of this invention is that of certain endocrine or hormone dependent breast tumors or cancers. Certain of these cancers have been shown to be dependent upon the abundant secretion of the hormone prolactin for their continued survival. The inhibition of the secretion of prolactin has been shown to diminish the growth rate and the actual survival of certain of these tumors. The immunization of such subjects with the hapten coupled or otherwise altered prolactin produced as described herein, would result in the systematic reduction of the level of this hormone circulating in the system and consequently, may result in the regression or remission of tumor growth. The consequence of this treatment would be far more favorable in terms of effective treatment of this disease since surgical removal of the breasts is a principal method of treatment currently available. It should be understood that this treatment should be effective for only those tumors that are dependent upon the secretion of prolactin for survival. Investigators also have determined, for example, that certain polypeptide entities are supportive factors to and secretions of neoplastic diseases in both man and other animals. These entities have biochemically, biologically and immunologically close resemblances to hormones, particularly to Chorionic Gonadotropin (CG), as well as to Luteinizing Hormone (LH). By applying the isoimmunization techniques of the invention, the function of such polypeptides or endogenous counterparts can be neutralized to carry out regulation of the malignancy. For example, tumors in both male and female primates may be treated by isoimmunization procedures developing antibodies to Chorionic Gonadotropin or Luteinizing Hormone or the noted entity analogous thereto. Further, neoplasms in primate females may be regulated by isoimmunization procedures developing antibodies to endogenous Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH). This hormone, when associated with a tumor state, tends to aggravate the tumorous condition. The immunochemical control asserted, as noted, neutralizes the naturally occuring hormone or the above-described entity biologically analogous thereto. As a consequence, the hormone or entity will not be available as would normally be the case, for example, the stimulation of some action of a target tissue. Conversely, the neutralization of the biological activity of the hormone or analogous entity may serve to take away an inhibitory action which it otherwise might assert. There are certain other disease states that may be treatable by the use of altered or modified hormonal or non-hormonal proteins as antigens. The disease states and the associated substances that may be used as modified antigens for immunological treatment of these diseases will be listed as follows: (1) modified parathyroid hormone for the treatment of kidney stones, (2) modified insulin and/or glucagon for the treatment of hyperinsulinoma, (3) modified thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) for the treatment of hyperthyroidism, and (4) modified secretin for the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome. Another group of polypeptides which can be altered by the procedures described herein and used in the field of human fertility control are specific non-hormonal protein antigens isolated from placental tissue. There is direct evidence that inhibition of substances that are specific to the placental tissue and do not have similar antigenic properties with other antigens from organs in other parts of the body, can result in the disruption of pregnancies by passive immunization. Such specific placental substances when modified to form modified polypeptides by the procedures described herein can be injected into the body of an animal of the same species as an effective fertility control means with the mechanism being active immunization similar to that described for the antigenic modification of hormones. The particular advantages of these substances in that placental antigens are foreign to the non-pregnant female human subject and therefore are unlikely to cause any cross-reaction or disruption of normal body function in the non-pregnant female. While the invention is useful for the human species it will be appreciated that it is also useful in connection with other animals. Similarly, while the reference herein with respect to fertility control is primarily directed to females, such described techniques may be applicable to males, i.e. FSH, its beta subunit and fragments thereof. Such immunization represents an effective fertility control procedure, providing no physiological consequences are encountered which may be found to react adversely to the performance of other body constituents. Whether the concerned hormone, non-hormonal protein or specific fragment thereof which is modified is naturally occurring or is a synthetic product is clearly immaterial. A synthetic protein molecule will perform the same function as the naturally occurring one, inasmuch as the body will react in an equivalent antigenic manner. It has accordingly been discovered by virtue of this invention that it is possible to interfere with or treat various disease states or medical problems which are caused or influenced by certain polypeptides by active immunization of a male or female animal by the production and use of antigens formed by administration of modified polypeptides. The modification of the polypeptides forms antigens which are then administered into an animal in which immunization is to be developed. Said modification is accomplished by attaching to a polypeptide one or more foreign reactive (modifying) groups and/or by attaching two or more polypeptides to a foreign reactive group (i.e., a carrier) or both of the above, so that the body of the animal, recognizing the modified polypeptide as a foreign object, produces antibodies which neutralize not only the modified protein but also the natural protein which is responsible for the disease or medical problem being regulated. In order to produce an effective quanta of antibodies to the antigen or targeted functional polypeptide, it may be advantageous to administer the modified polypeptide together with an immunological adjuvant. The term &#34;adjuvant&#34; is commonly referred to by those engaged in the field at hand as being a substance which will elevate the total immune response of an animal or person to any immunization thereof, i.e. the adjuvant is a nonspecific immuno-stimulator.",

    "abstract": "The present invention provides S-enantiomers of 1,4-dihydropyridines useful for the treatment of heart failure, preparation of compositions thereof and a method for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure comprising administration of these compounds. BACKGROUND AND OUTLINE OF THE INVENTION 1,4-Dihydropyridines having calcium antagonistic activity are widely used in the treatment of several cardiovascular diseases, for example, but not limited to, hypertension and angina. An important factor which limits the use of these compounds is the negative inotropic effect exerted by some of them (S. Goldmann et al., Angew Chem. Int. Ed. Engl: 30, 1559, (1991)). This effect serves to decrease the force or energy of cardiac contractions and its presence suggests caution when administering these compounds to patients suffering from cardiac diseases (although the resulting reduction in cardiac work could be beneficial in cases where it is desirable to avoid exertion of the heart, e.g., when a patient is recovering from a coronary infarct). Most of the 1,4-dihydropyridine derivatives used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, have one asymmetric carbon at the 4-position of the dihydropyridine ring. Currently, all of them are used as racemates, containing both the (S)- and the (R)-enantiomer. Experimental evaluation of the pharmacodynamic properties of the enantiomers of several dihydropyridines (e.g.: nitrendipine, isradipine, niguldipine, nimodipine, felodipine) have shown that the (S)-enantiomer, is a more potent calcium antagonist than the corresponding (R)-enantiomer.

No. 4,772,621 disclose asymmetric diesters of 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethylpyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acid and the stereoisomers or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof. These compounds are said to have antihypertensive and coronary dilating activity. It has now been surprisingly found that, besides the known and well expected potent effect in lowering the blood pressure already shown by their racemates, the (S)-enantiomers of these compounds possess also an unexpected positive inotropic effect. The unexpected positive inotropic effect makes the S-enantiomers particularly useful for treatment of patients afflicted by heart failure (HF). Further, this suggests the use of these compounds as the treatment of choice for patients suffering simultaneously from hypertension and compromised heart function. Heart (or cardiac) failure is a pathophysiologic state in which an abnormality of cardiac function causes a failure of the heart to pump blood at a rate sufficient to satisfy the requirement of the metabolizing tissues. One form of cardiac failure is myocardial failure, an abnormality (insufficient) of myocardial contraction which may be primary or secondary (e.g. can be incident to ischemia, or valvular abnormality, or pericardial inflammation or calcification). Other forms of heart failure are not accompanied by abnormal myocardial function (e.g. can be incident to acute hypertensive crisis, pulmonary embolism, or mitral valve stenosis). The presence or absence of heart failure or more generally of inability of the heart to meet the full metabolic demand is usually assessed by heart contractility indexes measurement. Among such indexes, the maximal rate of left ventricular rise (dp/dt max ) is the method most often used to evaluate the inotropic state of the heart. In the animal models utilized to assess heart contractility, dp/dt max  is usually derived from the ventricular pressure directly measured in the beating heart of the anaesthetized animals, usually dogs. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is the use of the (S)-enantiomers of asymmetric diesters of 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethylpyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acids, pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts thereof and pharmaceutical compositions comprising them, for the treatment of cardiac failure in mammals including humans in need of such treatment. Accordingly one aspect of the present invention is directed to methods comprising administering to mammals in need of such treatment S-enantiomers of 1,4-dihydropyridine compounds having a positive inotropic effect for the treatment of heart failure, and compositions comprising the S-dihydropyridines. The compounds are administered in amounts sufficient to enhance myocardial contractility. The compounds of this invention are the (S)-enantiomers of diesters of 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethylpyridine-3,5-dicarboxylic acids, having the general formula (I): ##STR1## wherein: Ph is phenyl, Ar is: 2-nitrophenyl, 3-nitrophenyl, 2,3-dichlorophenyl or benzofurazan-4-yl, A is a branched chain alkylene radical having from 2 to 6 carbon atoms, R is a straight or branched chain alkyl radical having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, optionally mono-substituted by an alkoxy substituent having from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, R 1  is hydrogen, hydroxy or an alkyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms, R 2  is hydrogen or methyl;",

The apparatus includes means for introducing liquid smoke onto the surface, means for spreading the liquid smoke onto the surface, and means for heating the regenerator member to regenerate the liquid smoke into a vapor. In one important embodiment, the regenerator member may be an inverted truncated cone, with the generally vertical surface comprising the inner surface of the cone. In this embodiment, the spreading means by be a rotating brush positioned so that is bristles contact the inner surface of the cone as the brush rotates. In another important embodiment, the regenerator member may be a truncated cone, with the generally vertical heating surface being the exterior conical surface of the cone. In this embodiment, the spreading means may be a stationary brush disposed against the outside surface of the cone such, with the cone rotating while the bristles of the brush contact its outer surface. The present invention thus involves a liquid smoke regenerator apparatus in which tar build-up on heating surfaces is eliminated by selectively volatilizing lower boiling point flavor and color constituents of the liquid smoke for application to comestible products and leaving a residue containing higher boiling point constituents, including tars, to be discarded. The composition of the refined smoke vapor and hence the smokey flavor and color which it will impart to a comestible product, may be tailored by regulating the volatilization temperatures in the apparatus. Alternatively, the refined smoke vapor may be condensed into a refined smoke condensate which can be applied directly to comestible products by dipping, coating, spraying or misting, or revolatilizing. The present invention is therefore directed to an apparatus for producing liquid smoke vapor.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to mailbox assemblies in general, and in particular to mailboxes having a mail delivery indicator flag by which a remote owner may detect the delivery of mail. Mailboxes for rural delivery of mail commonly have two indicator flags, each serving a different purpose. The first flag is for indicating to the mail deliverer that mail is present in the mailbox for pick-up; the second flag is for indicating to the mail recipient, from a remote viewing location, that mail has been delivered. There have been many prior art attempts to provide mailboxes with flag indicators which are actuated by the door of the mailbox, for the purpose of indicating the delivery of mail. One approach, typified by U.S. Pat. No. 2,687,846, teaches a flag member which tilts upon actuation of the front mailbox door. A second approach, embodied in U.S. Pat. No. 4,147,282, provides a pivotal flag component, which pivots from an upright position to a down position whenever the mailbox door is opened. Yet nother approach, represented by U.S. Pat. No. 3,648,924, contemplates a flag arm which is freed to pivot downward upon the opening of the mailbox door. Other mechanisms which address the problem are set forth in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,836,441; 4,759,496; 4,778,103; and 4,811,895. While the aforementioned patented articles achieve the intended objective to varying degrees, all have certain shortcomings which prevent them from representing an ideal solution. Many of the indicator mechanisms are complex and expensive to manufacture; some are dependent on maintaining a precise structural relationship between operational components in order to insure proper operation; and others are less than optimal in the visibility of the indicator flag when put to use. Moreover, prior art indicator mechanisms are fixed to one specific side of the mailbox and cannot be relocated to suit the various viewing angles which occur in use. Because of the fixed flag location, the visibility of the flag in certain situations is reduced. Also, the flag indicator mechanisms in the prior art lack a positive registration feature which secures the flag member in its proper position. They are thus susceptible to malfunction from external factors such as wind. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention addresses the above-described shortcomings in the prior art, by providing an improved mailbox assembly having mail delivery indicating capability. The mailbox assembly includes a mailbox body and downwardly pivoting forward door. The flag assembly provided with the mailbox can by attached to either side, at the option of the user; wherever the flag can be viewed to best advantage for that application. The flag assembly further is utilized to provide the door with its pivot attachment to the mailbox body, whereby adding to the economy of the assembly. The flag assembly comprises a housing assembly which pivotally attaches to one or the other sidewalls of the mailbox body, proximate the forward door. The housing assembly includes an internal cavity, a plug member seated within the cavity and providing a pivot post projection directed toward the mailbox body, and a retainer member which encloses an inward side of the cavity. A spring ring is also provided within the housing assembly cavity, between the retainer member and the head of the plug member. The retainer member and spring ring have central apertures through which the pivot post projects. Each side of the mailbox body and door have co-aligned apertures which receive the pivot post therethrough as well. An inward end of the pivot post has a locking flange which snaps over a surface surrounding the door aperture, whereby placing the spring ring in compression, and pressuring the retainer member against the side of the mailbox. The inwardly directed side of the retainer member has spaced apart detents adapted to engage a projection formed in the mailbox body side as the housing assembly rotates between a &#34;down&#34; position and an &#34;up&#34; position, thus creating positive registration in both positions. The housing assembly is further provided with a tab projection extending from the housing to a position forward of the mailbox door, whereby, upon opening the mailbox door, the door engages the tab projection, and initiates pivotal movement of the housing assembly and the flag arm attached thereto. A secondary assembly, substantially similar to the flag assembly, is also provided for attachment to the mailbox side opposite to the flag assembly. The secondary assembly substitutes a cap member for the housing member of the flag assembly, and provides the pivot post for the opposite side of the mailbox door. The user can select which side of the mailbox to put the flag assembly, depending on the visibility constraints of the mailbox site. The mailbox assembly can be shipped disassembled in kit form and subsequently assembled by the user without tools, to facilitate the aforementioned optional positionment of the flag assembly. Accordingly, it is an objective of the present invention to provide a mailbox assembly which is inexpensive to manufacture, and readily assembled and utilized. A further objective is to provide a mailbox assembly which requires no tools for assembly. Still a further objective is to provide a mailbox assembly which affords the user the option of alternate sides on which to locate the indicator flag assembly. Yet a further objective is to provide a mailbox assembly including a mail delivery indicator flag assembly which has positive registration detent means in the down and up conditions. A further objective is to provide an all plastic mailbox assembly which includes positive spring bias means for influencing a flag assembly against the mailbox body. Still a further objective is to provide an all plastic mailbox assembly which is composed of inexpensive, plastics material. These, and other, objectives, which will be apparent to those skilled in the art, are achieved by a preferred embodiment which is described in detail below, and which is illustrated by the accompanying drawings.",

    "abstract": "An object of the present invention is to provide an improved arrangement for a hydraulic brake booster of the type referred to hereinabove that does not require an additional pressure-limiting valve to throttle a predetermined maximum pressure and that does not transmit the control movements of the throttle element directly to the fluid in the booster chamber. A feature of the present invention is the provision of an arrangement for a hydraulic brake booster including a booster chamber, the arrangement permitting a controlled delivery of a pump-circulated pressure-transmitting fluid to the booster chamber, the arrangement comprising: a housing having a stepped bore; a throttle element slidably sealed in the bore; a piston slidably sealed in the bore adjacent one end of the throttle element and acted upon by pressure in the booster chamber in an actuating direction toward the throttle element, the piston being displaceable within limits; and a control spring disposed in the bore between the one end of the throttle element and an adjacent end of the piston to determine the maximum force transmitted from the piston to the throttle element. Because the throttle element receives a maximum force determined by the control spring, a predetermined pressure can be throttled in the pump-circulated fluid without the requirement for additional measures. Also, the presence of the interposed control spring provides for cushioned transmittal of the throttle element&#39;s control movements to the fluid in the booster chamber, and, thereby, substantially prevents the occurrence of vibrations disturbing the braking action. It will be an advantage to provide a stop formed in the housing against which the piston may bear in the actuating direction. This eliminates disturbing vibrations completely because the piston is urged against the stop when the pressure build-up in the booster chamber commences and is disengaged from the stop and moved back again only on termination of the braking action. If the end of the piston remote from the throttle element is acted upon in the actuating direction by the weak spring and the piston is anchored to the throttle element in such a manner to allow a predetermined relative movement between the piston and the throttle element, which is necessary for the control of the throttle&#39;s cross section, a very compact construction is achieved. In this arrangement, the piston is required to overcome short distances only so that the quantity of fluid necessary for pressure application is low. Because the piston surface exposed to the pressure in the booster chamber is a multiple larger than the piston surface at the throttle element which is acted upon by the throttled pressure, it is possible to throttle the full pressure determined by the control spring in the pump-circulated fluid at a moment when the pressure in the booster chamber is still low. This permits a faster delivery of a high pressure metered into the booster chamber than would be the case if the throttled pressure is always only slightly higher than the pressure in the booster chamber. Thus, it is possible to apply the connected brakes more quickly.",

    "abstract": "The present invention concerns an accurate and rapid system for assessing lachrymal fluid content in a person&#39;s eye and which also minimizes patient discomfort. More particularly, the invention concerns a sampling device for taking a representative lachrymal fluid sample from a person&#39;s eye, and an assessment device which determines an electrical parameter, preferably capacitance, which varies in accordance with the lachrymal fluid content of the sampling device and produces an output correlated therewith, such being thereby correlated with the lachrymal fluid content of the person&#39;s eye from which the sample was taken. 2. Background of the Prior Art The lachrymal fluid content of a person&#39;s eye has a bearing on general eye health, and in particular, is a factor in whether a person can wear contact lenses. That is,, to say, if a person&#39;s eyes produce insufficient lachrymal fluid, that is tears, then contact lenses are contra-indicated because the potential for irritation and discomfort. Those skilled in the art are familiar with the so-called Shirmer test for assessing the lachrymal fluid content of a person&#39;s eye. The Shirmer test comprises an elongated, fluid absorbent sample member made of filter paper. One end of the member is inserted under the lower eye lid of the eye being checked with the other end protruding. The sample member is retained in the eye for five minutes in order to allow the member to absorb a sufficient sample amount. The distance the lachrymal fluid migrates or &#34;wicks&#34; along the member toward the exposed end provides an indication of the lachrymal fluid content of the person&#39;s eye. As those skilled in the art appreciate, the Shermer test is not considered accurate because the relatively long term presence of the sampling member in a person&#39;s eye causes irritation and, in response, excess fluid production which distorts the results of the test. Because the test relies on wicking action, it also presents some inherent inaccuracies. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention solves the prior art problems as outlined above. That is to say, the invention hereof provides an accurate and rapid system for assessing lachrymal fluid content in a person&#39;s eye in manner which minimizes patient discomfort. Broadly speaking, the system hereof includes a sampling device and an assessment device. The sampling device includes a sample pad which is absorbent of lachrymal fluid at a predetermined known rate, and a handle portion which is non-absorbent of lachrymal fluid to prevent wicking therealong and used for placing the sample pad in substantially flush engagement with the patient&#39;s eye surface. The preferred assessment device includes a receiver for receiving a lachrymal fluid sample pad such as that described above and an electrical circuit coupled with the receiver for determining an electrical parameter, preferably capacitance of the pad, and responsive thereto for producing an output correlated with the lachrymal fluid content of the sample pad and thereby correlated with the lachrymal fluid amount present in the person&#39;s eye from which the sample was taken. In preferred forms, the receiver includes a pair of shiftable electrodes which define a sample pad receiving space therebetween. The preferred electrical circuit includes a microprocessor with an associated memory for storing correlation data which is used to correlate the output of the circuit with the electrical parameter. Other preferred aspects of the invention are discussed further hereinbelow.",

    "abstract": "Ultrasound imaging is utilized for real-time, noninvasive, nondestructive assessment of material density and strength of hard tissue to determine complex three-dimensional shapes, surface topology, non-uniform internal structures and to determine material properties of tissues. The present invention combines a Low Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound (LIPUS) device with a surface topology mapping apparatus to provide focused ultrasound therapy to enhance healing and accelerate callus mineralization. 2. Brief Description of the Background Art Osteoporosis and osteopenia are common diseases affecting a large proportion of the population, mostly elderly, which increase the risk of fracture at critical skeletal sites, e.g., hip, wrist and spine. After fracture, healing complications include non-union and poor quality of life. Various remedies have been developed to treat delayed unions and non-unions. Ultrasound (US) is known to have a strong positive influence on the three key stages of the healing process: inflammation, repair, and remodeling, due to the enhancement by US of angiogenic, chondrogenic and osteogenic activity. Clinical evidence confirms that US can effectively treat delayed unions and non-unions. US therapy applied to fracture healing relates to differential energy absorption of ultrasound that gives rise to an acoustic streaming, and resultant fluid flow as a mechano-transduction signal. Low energy mechanical stimulation, e.g. low intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS), accelerates healing of bone fractures and other recovery. See, U.S. Patent Publication 2008/0021327 A1 of Ahmed El-Bialy, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference. LIPUS stimulation transmits mechanical energy through and into biological tissues as an acoustic pressure wave and has been widely used in medicine as a non-invasive therapeutic tool, showing an accelerated rate of healing of fresh fractures. LIPUS stimulation can assist non-union and accelerate fracture repair. However, the effectiveness of localized LIPUS with optimized intensity has not been fully investigated. Moreover, soft tissue and cortical shell interference limits use of LIPUS stimulation. LIPUS is a biophysical form of intervention in the fracture-repair process, which through several mechanisms accelerates healing of fresh fractures and enhances callus formation in delayed union and nonunion. The acoustic pressure wave induced by US is indicative of a mechanical signal that takes full advantage of bone tissue sensitivity to low-level physical signals. However, such acoustically driven mechanical signal is several orders of magnitude lower than the peak strains generated by functional load-bearing, while the rates of loading induced by the US are several orders of magnitude higher. Extremely low-level, high-frequency mechanical signals persist in functionally loaded bone and represent strong regulatory signals to skeletal tissue, even during fracture-healing. Therapeutic US, and some operative US, uses intensities as high as 1 to 30 W/cm 2  and can cause considerable heating in living tissues. The use of US as a surgical instrument involves even higher levels of intensity (5 to 300 W/cm 2 ), and sharp bursts of energy used to fragment calculi initiate the healing of non-unions, ablate diseased tissues such as cataracts, and even remove methylmethacrylate cement during revision of prosthetic joints. The intensity level used for imaging, which is five orders of magnitude below that used for surgery, is regarded as non-thermal and nondestructive. Current therapeutic US uses plane waves and exposes the energy to broad range of tissues. The radical changes in density inherent in a healing callus may lose significant amounts of energy in the pathway of ultrasound. A localized and targeted/guided exposure of LIPUS overcomes these limitations and dramatically increases the efficiency of the treatment. The combined diagnostic and therapeutic quantitative ultrasound (QUS) with focal scan as in the present invention overcomes such shortcomings. In the present invention, focused LIPUS of modified LIPUS (mLIPUS) acts as an alternating pressure wave, creating localized pressure gradients within micro porosities of the subject bone, and anabolic shear forces on cell membranes, thereby changing local solute concentrations and initiating local fluid flow exchange/interaction. In vitro studies show that mLIPUS enhances osteoblast proliferation and endochondral bone formation and in vivo studies show mLIPUS to be anabolic in fresh fractures, enhancing endochondral bone formation, mineral density and mechanical strength. The present invention combines ultrasound focusing and mLIPUS stimulation to provide early identification of bone disorder and accelerate localized fracture healing. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, the present invention solves the above-mentioned problems of conventional systems, and provides an apparatus and method that combines ultrasound focusing and mLIPUS stimulation for early prediction of bone disorder and guided acceleration of fracture healing, using scanning confocal acoustic imaging and a modified low-intensity pulse ultrasound. In the present invention, a method and apparatus are provided for non-invasive bone fracture detection and accelerated healing. A paired phased array ultrasound scanning apparatus with multi-element transducers simultaneously maps three-dimensional bone surface topology at opposite surfaces along an ultrasound wave pathway. The mapped three dimensional topology is utilized to measure a thickness of the mapped bone and to detect a region of interest having a bone deterioration or a bone fracture. US wave velocity and attenuation are calculated as the ultrasound wave passes through the detected region of interest and a LIPUS pulse is applied to the region of interest, with the paired phased array ultrasound scanning apparatus focusing application of the LIPUS pulse.",

    "abstract": "The invention relates generally to a reproducible, efficient method of preparing nonaggregated microcapsules. The microcapsules are suitable for encapsulation or conjugation with substances useful as diagnostic and therapeutic agents. The invention also relates to amino-acid surface modified microcapsules and microcapsules conjugated with agents having particular potential for drug targeting. 2. Description of Related Art Microencapsulation is a well-studied art. It is basically the use of a matrix or encapsulating material to enclose gases, liquids or solids into particles of relatively small size (nanoparticles up to 500 μm). The matrix is capsular material selected according to the intended use of the microcapsules. Physical properties of encapsulated chemical entities may be modified because of the encapsulation. Other effects of encapsulation include dispersion of one substance within another, stabilization of emulsions and alteration of solubility rate. One of the most useful properties of encapsulated therapeutic materials is controlled release (Wright, et al., 1989; Wright et al., 1984). Microcapsules have been prepared by many methods, including coacervation, interfacial polymerization, mechanical methods, polymer dispersion and matrix encapsulation. Sustained release microcapsules have been prepared from ethylcellulose (Kawashima, et al., 1984) and poly-(D,L)-lactide (Benita, et al., 1984). There is voluminous literature on the preparation and use of encapsulating polymers designed for sustained drug release (Bechtel, 1986; Tice, et al., 1989). Although many preparations of microencapsulated compounds have been reported, few describe microparticles in the size range below 10 μm. Particles of 1-250 μm are typically prepared by a solvent evaporation technique (Tice and Gilley, 1985) while sizes from 1-10 μm have been made by emulsion deposition (Smith and Hunneyball, 1986). One method using solvent evaporation claims to provide a range of sizes from 0.5-250 μm (Mosier, 1985). Nevertheless, none of these methods appears to provide a homogeneous preparation of single-particle, nonaggregated microcapsules. Typical of these preparations is a tendency to aggregate having an overall size of about 177 to 395 μm with 5-162 μm particles making up the aggregates (Jaffe, 1981). This technique requires sieving to remove larger agglomerates, leaving behind a wide range of particle sizes which, although composed of small spheres, are nevertheless in aggregated form. Discrete microprills, polymeric particles in which a drug (for example, Mellarib™) is uniformly dispersed, have been disclosed (Fong, 1990). Although the microprills were reported to be nonaggregated, the average size range was 10-50 μm. Lack of particle size homogeneity may cause severe problems in quality control and in clinical use. For example, in chemoembolization studies, the particle diameter is fairly critical in that only a limited range of sizes will lodge in a target area (Bechtel, et al., 1986). If too large, damage to larger vessels may occur, while if too small, the particles pass through and drug is not released at the targeted site. Thus a homogeneous particle preparation is important. Despite the proliferation of microencapsulation methods, there is a particular need for simple and efficient methods of producing homogeneous preparations of microencapsulated agents for clinical treatment and diagnosis, most particularly in small, nonaggregated particles ranging from 0.5 to 500 μm. A method of preparing encapsulated therapeutic agents in 1 μm and 100 μm particles would provide more effective agents, particularly for diagnostic imaging and chemoembolization. Bioimaging agents microencapsulated in 1 μm particles would provide an ideal size particle for bioimaging studies, particularly if combined with capsular material selected to concentrate in the organ of interest. Additionally, the use of microencapsulation materials capable of targeting particular areas in vivo would enable improvements in biodistribution imaging studies as well as in drug delivery to specific organs. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a highly efficient, reproducible method of obtaining homogeneous nonaggregated preparations of polymeric microcapsules in which therapeutic or diagnostic agents may be encapsulated or conjugated. The invention also includes microcapsules prepared from polymers conjugated to an amino acid, enabling improved targeting of drug-laden microcapsules to a particular target organ or cell. The invention illustrates two important size ranges, 1 and 100 μm, of polymeric particles useful in clinical studies and in which imaging or therapeutic agents may be efficiently encapsulated. An important aspect of the invention is the preparation of homogeneous nonaggregated microcapsules having a diameter of approximately 1 μm. These microcapsules are prepared by combining a solution which may contain a drug or therapeutic agent, a nontoxic emulsifier and polymer dissolved in convenient solvent, and then vigorously agitating the mixture. Agitation is performed for a period of time sufficient for the development of microcapsules having a mean diameter below 5 μm. The formation of the microcapsules is monitored periodically, after which the organic solvent is removed and the microcapsules collected. The nontoxic emulsifier may be selected from several commonly used emulsifiers, for example Tween-80, polyvinyl alcohol, sodium laurylsulfate, Span 20, Lubrol, Triton™ X-100, cetylpyridinium chloride and the like. Thus a wide variety of emulsifiers may be suitable, including anionic, cationic, and non-ionic types. Likewise, a wide variety of materials may be used for the preparation of the capsules, including nonpolymers such as cholesterol, diglycerol, ethyl cellulose as well as numerous types of polymers. Microcapsules particularly useful for clinical or therapeutic purposes release their contents by erosion, degradation or diffusion. This is not to say that microcapsule polymers used for medical treatment must be biodegradable. For example, relatively permanent implantable drug-containing polymers (e.g., hydrogels) might be used for long-term sustained release in certain applications. Polymers particularly suitable for microencapsulation include poly-(D,L)-lactic acid, ethylhydroxyethyl cellulose, polycaprolactone, polycaprolactone diol, polylysine, polyglycolic acid, polybenzyl-L-glutamic acid, polymaleic acid and the like. Generally speaking, the emulsifier is soluble in water, while the polymer, typically water insoluble, is dissolved in an appropriate organic solvent. Water immiscible or miscible organic solvents may be used, depending on the nature of the polymer. Examples of solvents include, but are not limited to, acetone, water, ethyl acetate, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride and methylene chloride. An important step in the preparation of nonaggregated microcapsules less than 5 μm in diameter is the vigorous agitation of the mixture containing polymer, emulsifier and, when desired, a diagnostic or therapeutic agent. Agitation may be carried out by stirring, sonication, or a combination of agitation methods. If stirring alone is used, a speed of approximately 1500 rpms is preferred; however, where 1 μm preparations are desired, it is preferable to use sonication alone or in combination with stirring. If both stirring and sonication are used, sonication at approximately 20 Khz and stirring at 500 rpms are preferred settings. Sonication and stirring are most preferably used simultaneously. Agitation is continued for a period of time sufficient to form individual microcapsules with an average size less than 5 μm, typically at least 5 min and more preferably 10 minutes. Under the general conditions described, somewhat longer periods of time may be required depending on the polymer, the organic solvent used, the volume and concentration of starting material as well as pH and temperature. Microcapsule formation is typically monitored by periodically examining size and shape of the microcapsules as they form in solution. This step is particularly useful when optimizing time and agitating conditions to assure homogeneous preparations in the desired size range. Any method that detects size and shape of the capsules may be used, for example, removal of a drop of the solution and inspection under a light microscope at a magnification of approximately 600 fold. After the microcapsules have formed, the organic solvent is removed from the mixture. A convenient method, particularly for lower boiling organic solvents, is to stir the reaction mixture at relatively slow rpms, for example about 350 rpm, for a period of several hours until the solvent is completely evaporated. The length of time depends on the type and volume of solvent in addition to other factors related to physical properties. For example, the solvent acetone require about six hours for complete evaporation. Other solvents with lower vapor pressure/higher boiling points may require longer periods of time. Evaporation, in this process, occurs at room temperature, but higher temperatures may be applied when different solvents are used. Monitoring of capsule size and shape continues to be important throughout the evaporation phase to assure that aggregation does not occur. The microcapsules are collected, after complete evaporation of the organic solvent, preferably by filtration, for example, by filtration through a nylon mesh or other suitable filter that allows smaller particles to pass through while retaining the larger particles. The resulting suspension containing 1 μm microcapsules may then be further processed to isolate and store or use the particles. This is conveniently accomplished by centrifuging the suspension after which any residual organic solvent or emulsifier can be removed by washing either with water or sterile saline. The aqueous layer may then be decanted and the microcapsules resuspended in a liquid for storage or for therapeutic use. When used therapeutically, phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4 is a most preferred resuspension medium. This method has provided a high yield (99%) of nonaggregated 1 μm particles. The amount of material collected in the nylon sieve is rarely over 1%, and the microparticles prepared by this method are remarkably uniform with a narrow size distribution ranging from 0.5 to 5.0 μm with the highest percentage being approximately 1.0 μm.",

    "abstract": "The invention concerns a device for the mechanical processing of fish and introducing the same into cans, especially of small bulk fish like sardines, herrings, sprats or the like for preserving or conserving in preparation ready for consumption, the device comprising a rotatingly driven conveyor guided around deflection elements and comprising at least three conveyor portions defining two outer and at least one inner portion, each guided parallel to each other, driven synchronously and having trough elements which are arranged in a complementary manner with respect to each other to form troughs receiving the fish to be processed, the inner trough elements being flanked by at least one of the two outer trough elements and forming a slot with the latter, the device also comprising cutting means for separating head and tail from each fish and including at least two knives which each penetrate one of the slots between two trough elements down to beneath the base surface of the same, the device further comprising a gutting station for removing the innards from the fish rumps and including two suction heads arranged on the sides of the knife slots and coming into working relationship with the beheading surface of the rump pieces in order to remove the innards, and the device further comprising a transfer station for introducing the fish rumps positioned in the troughs into cans advanced in a timed manner with the troughs. 2. Description of Prior Art It is an essential aim in the manufacture of fish preserves or conserves in the form of cans with parts of fish, especially of rump pieces prepared ready for consumption to gain a fish content in weight of as small or narrow a tolerance as possible. This can be achieved in that fish of differing size are put together instinctively with regard to the portion weight in portions of three or four fish according to a certain packing pattern from which can-adapted or -sized fish portions of uniform length are cut by separating head and tail. For reasons of better optical presentation it is aimed to put together the portions from fish of at least nearly the same size. For this reason as well as with regard to the adjustment of the desired fish content a presorting of the fish according to size classification is carried out so that a rather small weight tolerance can be achieved with pieces of uniform length. If other size fish are to be processed then the observance of the tolerance can be essentially secured by changing the piece length and/or the packing pattern. A device with the above stated classification feature can be taken from Spanish utility model application no. 250 008 (6). In this device fish introduced into troughs of the desired type are guided to a cutting device which compromises two circular knives penetrating into the slots between the troughs elements. A gutting device in the form of a suction device is positioned downstream of the cutting device, which suction device comprises two suction heads arranged in the cutting plane of the circular knives, the suction heads come into functional relationship with the beheading surfaces of the rump pieces. If an adjustment for a different size of fish is to be carried out it is disadvantageous in this machine that the adjustment or setting of the desired fish content is very time-consuming and can only be carried out when the machine is stopped. Furthermore it cannot be avoided that single troughs are not occupied which has the consequence that the corresponding cans advanced in time with the troughs remain empty. This is especially disadvantageous with a machine which is interlinked, e.g. with a continuous flow installation for treating the can contents and a subsequent device for introducing sauce and seaming the cans. 3. Objects of the Invention Due to the demand for a quick treatment of the fish to be processed which is especially important in tropical or subtropical regions for reasons of freshness it is a main object of the invention to suggest a device with the help of which rump pieces can be introduced into the cans efficiently, maintaining the packing pattern predetermined when the fish are introduced into the cans. Another object of the invention lies in that a simple adaptation of the length of the rump pieces can be effected which can be carried out while the machine is in operation should be achieved. It is a further object of the invention to improve the downstream gutting device with regard to its efficiency. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention these objects are achieved in a device of the type described in the introductory paragraph of the specification in that each inner trough element is provided on its base with a base plate forming the support surface for the fish and adjustable in height; that an activating element is arranged in the region of the transfer station to be activated in time with the advancing movement of the inner trough elements, which activating element comes into functional relationship with the base plate; that the knives of the cutting device, which are preferably designed as circular knives and the suction heads are designed adjustable with respect to their distance from each other by means of a central adjusting mechanism; and that the transfer of the cans into the filling position ensues by means of an inserter which is activatable by a signal transmitter monitoring the filling of each inner trough element in time with the advancing movement of the inner trough elements. Advantageously the base plate is arranged to be both lowered and raised resiliently, preferably by the force of a spring so that the fish are held fixed in the given position during the processing and continuation of their movement. This fixing in the given position can be achieved in another preferred embodiment of the invention in that a hugger belt covering the opening of the inner trough elements is provided at least in the deflection region of the central conveyor to be passed by the filled inner trough elements, which belt is rotatingly driven continuously and synchronously to rotate with the central conveyor portion or running free with the same. In order to achieve an active ejection of the rumps filling the troughs from the latter a pair of gripping elements encompassing the front faces of the inner trough elements are provided in the region of the transfer station. In this context the parts of the gripping elements encompassing the inner trough elements may expediently be formed roof-like symmetrically to the transversal centre of these trough elements and/or arranged to be moved out of engagement in time with the movement of the inner trough elements. An especially advantageous cleaning effect can be achieved in that effective means for pincer-like gripping of the parts of the belly contents of the fish sucked into the suction opening and for extracting the same from the belly cavity of the fish are arranged in each suction head directly behind the suction opening positioned in the level of the cutting surface of the beheading cut. Thereby it is achieved that all innards jutting out of the belly cavity are extracted safely. Especially effective in function is the use of means for gripping and extracting the innards or intestines, which means comprise a rotatingly driven rotational body and a clamping surface associated to the circumferential surface of the rotational body at a short distance therefrom. Therein the rotational body may preferably be designed as a vane roller with differing axis position, which axis may either be essentially parallel or perpendicular to the conveying plane. A very simple solution may be achieved if the drive of the rotational body resp. the vane roller is performed by engaging the central conveyor portion carrying the inner trough elements. In this embodiment an offset arrangement of the suction heads can be advantageous, especially if each suction head is provided with a shutter closing the suction opening, which shutter may be formed to be activated by the fish since thus a vacuum may be concentrated on each suction head. According to a preferred embodiment of the inserter for the transfer of the cans into the filling position the inserter is controlled by means of a cam driven synchronously in time with the advancing movement of the troughs, a locking mechanism being provided between the cam and the inserter, which locking mechanism is activatable by a positioning element and controllable in dependence on the switch signal of the signal transmitter. In order to achieve an optimum with regard to the circuit means the signal transmitter can be positioned the same number of trough parts in front of the transfer station as empty cans are provided between feeding and transfer stations. In order to avoid that cans reach the transfer station in the wrong position, e.g. with the opening facing downwards, the can path heading into the transfer station can be provided with a monitoring device for controlling the position of the same.",

    "abstract": "The object of the present invention is therefore to provide an improved transmission unit, an improved shifting device and an improved transmission housing for a vehicle operated by muscle force, as a result of which a more compact design and a large number of gearspeeds accompanied by a reduced weight can be implemented. According to a first aspect of the invention there is provided a shifting device for a transmission unit of a vehicle operated by muscle force, having a first shaft on which a plurality of idler gears is mounted, a corresponding number of gearwheels, which are mounted on at least one second shaft, wherein the idler gears can each be connected to the first shaft by means of shifting means, wherein the first shaft is formed as a hollow shaft and has two shifting pins which lie coaxially on the inside, wherein the shifting pins are each connected to drive means which are configured to rotate the shifting pins in order to actuate the shifting means. According to a second aspect of the invention there is provided a transmission unit for a vehicle which is driven by muscle force, having an input shaft which can be connected on opposite sides to cranks for driving the vehicle, having a first partial transmission, wherein the first partial transmission has a countershaft, wherein a plurality of driving gearwheels is mounted on the input shaft, and wherein a corresponding plurality of driven gearwheels of the first partial transmission is mounted on the countershaft, wherein the driven gearwheels of the first partial transmission are formed as idler gears which can be connected rotationally fixed to the countershaft by means of shifting means, wherein the countershaft forms an input shaft of a second partial transmission, on which input shaft a plurality of second driving gears are mounted, wherein the second partial transmission has an output shaft on which a corresponding plurality of second driven gearwheels is mounted, wherein the second driving gears of the second partial transmission are formed as idler gears which can be connected rotationally fixed to the input shaft by means of shifting means, and wherein the output shaft of the second partial transmission is formed as a hollow shaft which is arranged coaxially with respect to the input shaft. According to a third aspect of the invention there is provided a transmission unit for a vehicle driven by muscle force, having a first partial transmission, wherein the first partial transmission has an input shaft and a countershaft, wherein a plurality of driving gears is mounted on the input shaft, and wherein a corresponding plurality of driven gears is mounted on the countershaft, wherein the countershaft of the first partial transmission can be connected to an input shaft of a second partial transmission, on which input shaft a plurality of second driving gears is mounted, wherein the second partial transmission has an output shaft on which a corresponding plurality of driven gearwheels is mounted, and wherein the countershaft of the first partial transmission can be connected to the input shaft of the second partial transmission by means of at least one epicyclic transmission. According to a fourth aspect of the invention there is provided a transmission housing for a transmission unit of a vehicle operated by muscle force, having a housing casing which forms a circumferential face of the transmission housing, and a transmission cage for mounting the transmission unit, which transmission cage has pins for axially connecting at least two bearing plates, wherein at least one of the bearing plates is formed in such a way that in the assembled state of the transmission housing it substantially closes off the housing casing at one axial end. One advantage of the first aspect of the invention is that the shifting pins permit an axially compact design of the transmission unit because the shifting pins are rotated in order to actuate the shifting means in the second shaft. One advantage of the second aspect of the transmission unit according to the invention is that a compact design and at the same time a large number of shiftable gearspeeds can be implemented because the two partial transmissions are connected one behind the other and have a common shaft on which gearwheels of both partial transmissions are mounted. In addition, the compact design is implemented by the output shaft which is arranged coaxially with respect to the through shaft, wherein the through shaft is used simultaneously as an input shaft of the first partial transmission, and the output shaft is used simultaneously as an output shaft of the second partial transmission. An advantage of the third aspect of the transmission unit according to the invention is that by virtue of a simple epicyclic transmission requiring little space, a further partial transmission for the transmission unit can be implemented and as a result the number of gearspeeds which can be implemented is at least doubled. An advantage of the fourth aspect of the transmission unit according to the invention is that at least one of the bearing plates serves simultaneously as a housing cover and closes off the transmission housing axially. As a result, it is possible to dispense with at least one transmission housing cover, as a result of which the weight of the transmission unit can be advantageously reduced and the installation space made smaller. In the first aspect of the invention it is preferred if the drive means are configured to rotate the corresponding shifting pin synchronously with respect to the first shaft in order to maintain a shifted state and to rotate the shifting pin in relation to the first shaft in order to carry out a gear change. As a result, the shifting pin can actuate the shifting means by a relative movement, and individual idler gears can be connected rotationally fixed to the first shaft. In addition it is advantageous if the two shifting pins can be rotated independently of one another. As a result, the idler gears can be shifted independently of one another, as a result of which a large number of gearspeeds can be implemented. Furthermore, it is advantageous if the drive means each have a rotational speed super-imposition transmission. As a result, the shifting pin can rotate synchronously with the first shaft, and a second rotational movement can easily be superimposed. It is advantageous here if the rotational speed super-imposition transmission is formed as a planetary gear mechanism. As a result, a simple and compact design of the rotational speed super-imposition mechanism is possible. The planetary gear mechanism is preferably formed as a stepped planetary gear mechanism. As a result, a particularly compact design is possible. It is preferred here if the first shaft is connected rotationally fixed to a sun gear of the planetary gear mechanism, and the shifting pin is connected rotationally fixed to a planetary carrier of the planetary gear mechanism. As a result, the rotation of the first shaft can be transmitted with little expenditure to the shifting pin.",

    "abstract": "We have now found that excellent therapeutic results can be achieved by using a divergent ultrasonic field in conjunction with warm water circulating over the skin above the treatment area to achieve local hyperthermia. This has some advantages because water circulating at 43° C. raises local tissue temperature at a depth of 3 cm below the skin to 40° C. Thus the intensity of ultrasound required to produce therapeutic temperatures can be much reduced, with the benefit of minimizing any potential side-effects of the ultrasound. Moreover, divergent fields are able to cover a bigger treatment volume and spare the organs beneath the treated area because of the reductions in local intensity. Further the microprocessor/microcomputer control is relatively simple since it does not need to control stepping motors. According to the present invention therefore there is provided an ultrasound hyperthermia unit including an ultrasound transducer assembly angled to direct sonic energy toward a target, characterised in that the array comprises a plurality of divergent transducers each directed to provide a treatment field about a central axis. A temperature sensing means for operative association with the array, and adapted to provide an output signal indicative of temperature values adjacent a target tumour, may be provided when the unit is adapted for use in the treatment of neoplastic tissues. In this instance the arrangement is such that said output signal is utilised to control the power output of the array to achieve localised heating of the tumour tissues above viability. In both the above foregoing instances (physiotherapeutic treatment and the treatment of neoplastic tissues) a liquid bath may be located between the array and the skin of a patient, said liquid bath being adapted to warm the superficial tissues. Optionally, the assembly may be provided with a transducer coaxial with the central support axis, and with a plurality of divergent transducers arranged radially about the central axis. A system in accordance with this invention may comprise a warm-water circulating unit for contact with the skin of a patient, which forms a single unit with a transducer array, of preferably four or five divergent transducers. The bath may be formed in part of a flexible membrane so that it can change its shape in use to modify the distance between the array and the superficial tissues. One transducer may be a plane transducer and may be placed centrally with the other four or five transducers symmetrically placed around it, but inclined to it at an angle of, for example, 66.4° to the main axis of the central transducer. In a preferred embodiment the tranducer array is formed of a support into which selected tranducers may be plugged as necessary. The assembly of the invention may also be provided with a liquid lens in association with each transducer to alter the ultrasound distribution for different treatments. In a preferred embodiment the transducers may be interspersed with one or more imaging or temperature sensing transducers to allow the array to provide further information. One of the ultrasound transducers can, for example, also be used intermittently in a sensing role, or the additional transducer can be used in a pulsed or phased sensing mode. The temperature sensing means may be a thermocouple or other sensing device adapted for positioning adjacent to or in the tumour tissue. This is preferably a linearly arranged sensor with a plurality of sensing positions along its length whereby a single needle insertion will provide all the required temperature information for microprocessor control. Alternatively, non-invasive probes may be used such as microwave thermometers. Additionally, the skin overlaid by the bath may have in contact therewith a liquid crystal device to indicate the temperature of the skin by colour changes. The assembly of the invention may be controlled by a microprocessor which utilizes the temperature signals to control the power output thereof. This enables field contours, (i.e., isotherms) to be arranged to conform with non-symmetric tumour shapes. Further by this or other means the frequency of the ultrasound may be stepped up or down to harmonic higher harmonic or sub-harmonic frequencies to alter depth, and/or temperature distributions, since we have found that absorption coefficient depends on frequency. Further, square wave or sinusoidal signals may be selected to alter temperature distribution. Simpler assemblies are usually required for use in physiotherapy. Generally, the temperature sensing means can be dispensed with, and the unit will operate without a water bath so long as the array is in intimate contact with the skin. However, a water bath enables the unit to be readily used on difficult body contours such as elbows and knees, and gentle warming of the skin in these areas assists treatment by reducing the amount of ultrasound required. Because ultrasound is directed toward a source of pain from, for example, five different directions, higher intensities can be applied to a target joint, for example, without affecting patient tolerance. The use of divergent transducers allows large volumes of tissues to be treated without adversely affecting underlying sensitive tissues because the applied power decreases exponentially.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to troughs for use in watering livestock, and more particularly to a trough that automatically maintains a selected volume of water and substantially resists damage to its operative components by livestock. 2. Description of the Prior Art Watering troughs are widely used by livestock producers who raise their livestock in grazing paddocks that do not have natural water sources such as streams or ponds. The use of water troughs is also frequently used for the exclusion of livestock from natural bodies of water. Some water troughs take the form of a simple holding tank that is placed in the pasture and must be manually filled with water that is brought to the trough from a remote source. Some troughs are positioned adjacent to a water source that must be manually actuated, such as a hand pump that is coupled with a well. However, the manual labor required to deliver water to the troughs expends valuable time and, depending on the location of the trough, can be a significant inconvenience. Prior art methods have attempted to automate livestock watering systems. However, those attempts typically resulted in watering troughs that were either too complex and costly to operate or troughs that repeatedly failed to perform their automated function. Oftentimes, the failure of an automated water trough is due to component damage caused by livestock or the elements. As livestock repeatedly come into contact with water supply lines, valves and other such structures, the automated system invariably becomes damaged and fails over time. Harsh winters and dry, hot summers will also wear down component systems, if not causing them to fail suddenly. Accordingly, what is needed is an automated watering system for livestock that is comprised of structural components that resist the damaging effects that livestock and the elements can have on such systems. However, such an automated watering system should also be flexible in use as well as simple and inexpensive to manufacture. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The watering trough of the present invention is generally provided with an automated water supply system that maintains a desired volume of water for watering livestock throughout the year. The trough is provided with a base and an outer wall that extends upwardly from a peripheral edge of the base to form an open cavity for holding the water. A fluid supply conduit is positioned to deliver the water to the cavity. In one preferred embodiment, the fluid supply conduit extends beneath the ground surface from a water source and enters the trough through its base. A valve and valve actuator are coupled to the fluid supply conduit and adjusted to permit the flow of water into the cavity until a desired volume is reached, at which time the flow of water is terminated. A preferred embodiment of the trough incorporates an inner wall that at least partially surrounds the valve and valve actuator to substantially limit the incidence of contact between the components and the livestock. The inner wall may be shaped to form a protective tower, which surrounds the valve and valve actuator. An overflow conduit may also be positioned within the protective tower to disperse excess water in the event that the valve actuator fails to terminate the flow of water. To further reduce the incidence of contact between the components and the livestock, the protective tower may extend upwardly from the base of the water trough at a point approximating the center of the trough. Another preferred embodiment fabricates the base and wall of the trough from a portion of a recycled over-the-road tire. A plug is fashioned to seal the bottom opening of the tire, and the protective tower is positioned to extend upwardly from the plug. Such a “tire trough” may be easily incorporated with a heat sink to reduce the chances of the water freezing during the winter. It is therefore one of the principal objects of the present invention to provide an automated watering trough that substantially prevents damage to the automation components and water supply by livestock using the trough. A further object of the present invention is to provide an automated watering trough that substantially prevents damage to the automation components from the weather and other natural elements. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an automated watering trough that makes a substantial use of recycled products during its construction. Still another object of the present invention is to provide an automated watering trough that is relatively simple in construction. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an automated watering trough that is easily adapted for a plurality of uses in different settings and environments.

    "abstract": "A vascular access assembly and safety device is disclosed that includes a catheter assembly including a catheter hub and a catheter tube extending distally from the catheter hub, a needle assembly including a needle having a needle tip, and a safety device including a housing and a safety clip. The housing defines a cavity and proximal and distal openings through endwalls of the housing and the safety clip is formed of a resilient material and is supported within the cavity of the housing. The safety clip defines a distal opening, a central opening and a proximal opening which are aligned with each other and with the proximal and distal openings of the housing in a first deformed position of the safety clip to slidably receive the needle. The needle retains the safety clip in the first deformed position. The housing defines a ramp positioned between the endwalls of the housing and against which the safety clip abuts when the safety clip is in the first deformed position. When the needle is withdrawn from the catheter assembly such that the needle tip passes through the distal opening of the safety clip, the safety clip is configured to ride up the ramp and move to a second position to obstruct distal movement of the needle tip into the distal opening of the housing. In one embodiment, a distal end of the safety clip includes a hook portion which is positioned to engage the catheter hub when the safety clip is in the first deformed position to releasably secure the safety device to the catheter hub. The hook portion is movable to a position disengaged from the catheter hub when the safety clip moves to the second position. In one embodiment, the safety clip is configured to move to a third position when the needle tip is withdrawn through the central opening of the safety clip to further obstruct distal movement of the needle tip through the distal opening. In the third position, the orientation of the proximal opening is such that the clip binds with the needle adjacent the third opening to obstruct proximal movement of the needle in relation to the safety clip. In another embodiment, vascular access assembly and safety device includes a catheter assembly including a catheter hub and a catheter tube extending distally from the catheter hub, a needle assembly including a needle hub and a needle extending distally from the needle hub, and a safety device including a housing defining a cavity and a safety clip supported within the cavity. The housing includes a proximal opening dimensioned to slidably receive the needle and an open distal end. The safety clip has a pair of resilient legs which are configured to releasably engage a proximal end of the catheter hub in a deformed first position of the safety clip to releasably secure the safety device to the catheter assembly. The safety clip is movable to a second non-deformed position, wherein the resilient legs block distal movement of the needle from within the housing. In one embodiment, each resilient leg of the pair of resilient legs includes a protrusion which is configured to be received in a recess formed in the catheter hub to releasably secure the safety device to the catheter hub. The safety is manually releasable from engagement with the catheter hub. The safety clip may include a proximal wall defining an opening for slidably receiving the needle. The needle defines an enlarged diameter portion wherein the outer diameter of the enlarged diameter portion is greater than the inside diameter of the opening in the proximal wall of the safety clip such that withdrawal of the needle through the proximal opening of the safety clip is prevented. In one embodiment, each of the resilient legs of the pair of resilient legs includes a radial portion. The radial portions are dimensioned to obstruct distal movement of the needle when the safety clip is disengaged from the catheter hub and moves from the first deformed position to the second non-deformed position. In another embodiment, the vascular access assembly and safety device includes a catheter assembly including a catheter hub and a catheter tube extending distally from the catheter hub, a needle assembly including a needle hub and a needle extending distally from the needle hub, the needle including a needle tip, and a safety device including a housing defining a cavity and a safety clip positioned within the cavity. The housing defines a proximal opening and a distal opening. The safety clip is formed from a resilient material and has a U-shaped configuration including a first leg positioned adjacent an inner wall of the housing and a second leg supporting a tab. In an assembled state, the needle extends through the distal and proximal openings of the housing of the safety device and through the catheter assembly and the safety clip is compressed between the inner wall of the housing and the tab slidably engages the needle. Upon withdrawal of the needle tip into the housing of the safety device and proximally of the tab of the safety clip, the safety clip moves to a non-compressed position such that the tab obstructs distal movement of the needle into the distal opening of the housing. In one embodiment, the needle includes an enlarged diameter portion and a bushing is slidably supported on the needle proximally of the enlarged diameter portion. The inner diameter of the bushing is smaller than the outer diameter of the enlarged diameter portion, and the outer diameter of the bushing is larger than the inner diameter of the proximal opening of the housing of the safety device to prevent withdrawal of the needle tip from the proximal opening. The housing may include a resilient arm which includes a projection which is received in a recess formed in the catheter hub to releasably secure the catheter hub to the safety device. In one embodiment, the tab if the safety clip includes a rounded end portion positioned to slidably engage the needle in the assembled state. In another embodiment, the vascular access assembly and safety device includes a needle having a needle tip and an enlarged diameter portion, and the safety device includes a housing defining a throughbore and having a distal open end and a proximal opening dimensioned to slidably receive the needle. The housing includes a resilient arm including a radially extending protrusion configured to releasably engage a catheter hub. A first disk is fixedly supported within the housing and defines a recess defined by a plurality of proximally extending fingers. The proximally extending fingers define a central opening and are configured to deflect inwardly to facilitate passage of the enlarged diameter portion of the needle in a proximal direction through the central opening of the disk but to prevent passage of the enlarged diameter portion of the needle through the central opening of the disk in a distal direction. In one embodiment, the safety device recess is frusto-conical or spherical. The safety device may further include a second disk supported proximally of the first disk. The second disk includes a plurality of distally extending fingers that define a central opening and are configured to prevent passage of the enlarged diameter portion of a needle in the proximal direction. In another embodiment, the vascular access assembly and safety device includes a needle including an enlarged diameter portion and a needle tip, a housing defining a cavity having an open distal end and a proximal opening, a large diameter portion, a small diameter portion, a distally facing ramp portion positioned between the large diameter portion and the small diameter portion, and a proximally facing shoulder positioned adjacent a proximal end of the ramp portion. A clip which is formed of a resilient material and has a proximal wall defining an opening for slidably receiving a needle is provided. A leg extends radially outwardly and distally from each end of the proximal wall. Each leg includes a radially and proximally extending portion. At least one of the radially and proximally extending portions includes a cutout for slidably receiving the needle. In an advanced position of the needle, the clip is positioned about the needle in the large diameter portion of the housing and the needle extends distally from the open distal end of the housing. Upon withdrawal of the needle tip into the housing, the enlarged diameter portion of the needle engages the radially and proximally extending portions to deflect the radially and proximally extending portions inwardly to allow passage of the enlarged diameter portion of the needle past the radially and proximally extending portions and into engagement with the proximal wall. Further withdrawal of the needle effects movement of the clip over the distally facing ramp portion, past the proximally facing shoulder and into the small diameter portion of the cavity. The enlarged diameter portion of the needle has a diameter larger than the opening in the proximal wall to prevent proximal movement of the needle tip from a proximal end of the housing. The small diameter portion of the cavity of the housing prevents outward deflection of the radially and proximally extending portions of the clip and the proximally facing shoulder prevents distal movement of the clip from the small diameter portion to prevent distal movement of the needle tip from the cavity of the housing.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to wall racks or wall shelf units and, in particular, to a bracket for fastening shelves of varying thicknesses to a wall with at least two identical brackets being used to fasten a shelf. 2. Description of the Related Art Numerous designs of brackets of the aforementioned type are known, the simplest being plain angle brackets which can be fixed to the wall. These brackets have projecting arms securing support shelves. The support shelves may be fastened to the projecting arms by means of screws or the like. Wall shelf units constructed with brackets of this kind nevertheless leave much to be desired, particularly with respect to their visual appearance, and are therefore used mainly in places where an attractive appearance is not of primary importance. For use in living quarters, on the other hand, brackets having a quite attractive appearance (of narrow design or else in the form of longitudinal sections) are already known and are, above all, distinguished by the depth of the shelf. They project only a relatively short distance from the wall, in some cases less than 10% of the total shelf depth, and thus give the shelf a light appearance, almost as if it were hanging from the wall. In such cases, it is essential for the shelf to be secured to the bracket to prevent against upward movement, since the shelf would otherwise fall forward due to the distance by which it projects from the wall. To control the considerable upwardly directed forces or torques occurring when a load acts on the shelf, simple screwing is usually not sufficient, particularly in the case of wooden shelves. Known brackets are therefore also designed to grip around the shelves from behind and thus apply a holding and clamping action not only under the shelf but also above the forwardly projecting parts. A bracket of this kind, the height of which is approximately as great as its width, is suitable for variable shelf thicknesses and includes two pressure diecastings of aluminum between which the shelf is clamped, an upper U-shaped part which grips around the shelf from above and is screwed to the wall, and a lower part which is moveable relative to the upper part and has a support surface for the shelf. In order to obtain the clamping action on the shelf, the lower part can be screwed against the upper part by means of two screws which are screwed into threaded holes in the bottom leg of the upper part and pass through two respective aligned holes in the lower part. Although the known bracket is of simple construction and is simple to use, it has the disadvantage of having a lower part that provides the support surface for a shelf that is variable in height. In an assembly of wall shelf units, the shelf support surface typically forms the fixed reference height. In addition, the known bracket also has the disadvantage in that the screw connection must be made from below. SUMMARY OF TEE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a visually attractive bracket of the above-described type which, as compared to the depth of the shelf, projects only a short distance from the wall and is suitable for different shelf thicknesses. Another object of the present invention is to provide a bracket that is easy to manufacture and assemble and has adequate stability. Still another object of the present invention is to provide a bracket that is appropriate for shelves of different materials, including plastics, stone or glass. To achieve these and other advantages and in accordance with the purpose of the invention, as embodied and broadly described, the invention provides for a bracket for fastening shelves of various thicknesses to a wall comprising a support surface, a clamp opposite the support surface for pressing the shelf against the support surface, a shelf engagement region located between the support surface and the clamp for receiving the shelf, and a cover for concealing the clamp. In another aspect, the invention provides for a clamp for pressing shelves of various thicknesses against a support surface comprises a fastening head, a vertical hole located in the fastening head, and a vertically adjustable clamp screw mounted in the vertical hole to press the shelves of varying thicknesses against the support surface. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory and are intended to provide further explanation of the invention as claimed.",

Summary of the Prior Art Unitary molded plastic agitators for use with floor care appliances or the like are not shown heretofore to our knowledge with molded in beater bars that positively tend to urge the floor or floor covering dirt towards the suction duct for the floor care appliance. Obviously, the furnishing of a molded plastic agitator would be advantageous, while the presence of beater bars angled for dirt urging on any agitator would aid in the efficient pickup of dirt by the floor care appliance. Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a unitary molded plastic agitator with integral beater bars. It is a further object of the invention to form beater bars angled relative to the vertical to tend to work the floor covering and entrapped dirt. It is a still further object of the invention to angle the beater bars towards the suction duct to aid in moving dirt in that direction. It is an even further object of the invention to provide brush rows which cooperate with the beater bars in their dirt urging function. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention has as its principle object the provision of a new agitator arrangement in a cleaner which can be made of plastic and easily molded so as to provide a relatively inexpensive replaceable agitator for a floor care appliance. According to the present invention, a plastic molded agitator is provided having integrally molded beater bars and a lanced arrangement for mounting brush tufts, disposed between the beater bars. The beater bars comprise a series of short stubby protrusions extending from the general overall face of the agitator and angled obliquely relative to the agitator roll axis and spiralling in a screw-like fashion to provide for easy moldability and, at the same time, tending to limit the noise generated by the use of a beater bar arrangement on an agitator. The angular positioning of the beater bars also works against the floor covering in a transverse direction relative to agitator rotation. The brush strips are arranged in a helix fashion and in a chevron pattern with the helix being relatively steep to insure a maximum amount of brush area on the carpet at one time to prevent the brushes acting as beater bars and generating unwanted noise. These brush strips ideally take the form as an offset chevron relationship adjacent the duct suction opening to the cleaner, to tend to move dirt to this opening and to permit easy placement of the beater bars on the agitator cylinder. The beater bars all along the agitator surface are also angled towards the duct suction opening so as to tend to move dirt in the carpet along towards it as does the offset chevron brush arrangement.",

    "abstract": "Problems to be Solved The method of supporting and fixing the club shaft or the grip of each wood golf club at two points needs a large supporting device. In this sense, it is very costly. The direction of the head of the golf club displayed is uncertain. Accordingly, when the customer picks up the golf club and returns it to the display supporting device, the club head is often returned in a different position than originally. Therefore, golf clubs are displayed with their heads being irregular in direction. Also, for the method of firmly supporting the golf clubs by using the mold, in the case that three wood golf clubs are displayed while being arranged side by side by the golf club display supporting device, the mold itself becomes large in size, as shown in  FIG. 9 . In an effort to cope with this, if a designer wants to reduce the cost for the parts holding the club heads, additional problems arise in which the golf club shafts are not displayed in an orderly manner, and the three club shafts arranged side by side are going in all directions. Also in the case of iron clubs supported at two points, when the display methods as shown in  FIGS. 10 and 11  are used, the supporting of the iron clubs based on the two-point support is instable, and the club heads cannot be stably displayed. Even if the salesperson arranges the golf clubs to face the stamped brand names and the stamped manufacture names toward customers, after the customers pick them up from the club holder and examines it by practice swinging and detailed inspection, he/she would not put the golf club back in the desired position in many cases. Accordingly, the salesperson needs to put them back in the right positions. For the reasons stated above, there is a demand for the development of such a golf club display holder that if the customer returns the golf club back in the original position, the golf club can be displayed in a desirable manner. Ten iron clubs are handled as one set, and it is vital to display those ten iron clubs as one set. The heads of the iron clubs are different from one another in shape. Therefore, to enhance decorative quality and display efficiency leading to sales promotion, new ideas must be developed. Also when the golf clubs are vertically displayed as shown in  FIG. 11 , the two-point support method is basically used for supporting those clubs. Consequently, the golf club support is instable. Different club shaft lengths of the golf clubs result in different heights of the club heads. When the golf clubs look as they are in the picture, no problem arises. When the club heads are directed in an alternative fashion, the display effects of the golf clubs suffers from less decorative qualities and less attractiveness to customers. To cope with this, the applicant of the present patent application filed a patent application, which is now disclosed and numbered as Japanese published application JP-A 2004-136069, as already referred. In this disclosed technology, a member for hooking the club, and a member for connecting and supporting a plurality of members, are separately formed. The hook member has a structure that is thick enough to form a concave part therein, and the club head is stably placed, as a convex part, in the concave part of the hook member. The material used for the hook member is an elastic material, such as rubber or silicone resin. The connecting member is made of metal or plastic material. The resulting golf club display supporting device is not large in size as a whole, and does not spoil the decorative quality of the materials displayed. For wood golf clubs, it was found that when the club shaft is resiliently held along the club shaft while being in contact with only one point, both the face side and the wood face of the wood golf club, which are located on both sides of the club shaft, when the golf club is firmly held. A golf club display supporting device based on this fact found can stably and firmly support the golf club without increasing the structure size.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to apiarian apparatus and more particularly to a traffic regulating bottom board for use with a beehive. 2. Description of the Prior Art Devices for controlling the direction of traffic flow in a beehive for reducing congestion, and generally improving the efficiency of the hive, have been suggested by prior art workers, such as V. E. Root in U.S. Pat. No. 3,200,419 issued Aug. 17, 1965. These workers have emphasized the importance of adapting the beehive design to coincide with the instincts and habits of honeybees. In particular, it has been found that the uncontrolled mixing of departing bees with arriving bees bearing nectar or pollen may result in considerable confusion among the members of the brood, which can lead to a loss in honey production. In addition, orderly hive management can also prevent unwanted swarming, propolis production, comb gnawing, bee fatalities and other inefficient and uneconomical behavior. While there have been attempts to solve these problems, such apparatus has been relatively complex and not adapted for easy installation on existing apiaries. Hence, there has not been widespread acceptance of such devices among commerical and hobbyist beekeepers. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION My invention provides means for orderly controlling arriving and departing honeybee traffic and can be adapted for use in existing hives. In one preferred embodiment, the inside surfaces of the sides of a conventional bottom board are provided with a groove or slot capable of accepting a plurality of thin spaced slats, thus providing access passages greater than the bee space above and below the slats. While a type of slatted construction has been used heretofore in the so-called Killion and Bovard rocks which are placed above a standard bottom board to improve egg laying in the lower brood chamber and reduce entrance congestion, such slats have not been made an integral part of the bottom board. In my construction, sufficient space is left between adjoining slats to permit easy access of the bees to the area beneath the slats. This arrangement improves hive ventilation without creating drafts and also results in a cleaner bottom board floor devoid of propolis ramps which honeybees normally construct to gain access to honeycomb frames. Furthermore, the slatted construction produces less comb gnawing and therefore a better brood pattern. The slats may also be made removable for ease in cleaning dead insects and other debris from the bottom board floor. Another important feature of my invention is the use of a removable upwardly inclined arrival ramp positioned at the entrance to the bottom board, which guides incoming bees directly to the honeycomb frames. The arrival ramp is constructed of a wire mesh or similar material to improve hive ventilation and is slidably received within the slot or groove in the bottom board walls so that the ramp assumes a position substantially parallel to the bottom board floor. The forward edge of the arrival ramp is downwardly inclined to provide a landing deck for the incoming honeybees. This construction permits easier deceleration for the load-bearing bees and results in less loss of nectar or pollen. After alighting on the landing deck, the bees are directed across a substantially planar horizontal portion of the arrival ramp to an upwardly inclined ladder portion at the rear of the ramp which leads directly to the lower edge of the honeycomb frames. Since the ramp extends completely across the full width of the bottom board, there is ample room for guard bees to police the entrance. Bees leaving the hive move downwardly from the honeycomb frames, through the spaces between the bottom board slats, and along the floor of the bottom board beneath the arrival ramp to the front of the bottom board. The front of the bottom board is fashioned in a downwardly sloping departure ramp substantially parallel to the downwardly inclined landing deck of the arrival ramp, from which the bees may exit the hive. Since the departure ramp extends substantially across the entire width of the bottom board, there is also ample room for guard bees to police the exit space. In addition, since the bottom board is divided laterally into entrance and exit spaces of slightly greater height than the bee space, mice, rodents and other undesired visitors are excluded. The ramp is removable to permit the floor of the bottom board to be easily cleaned, or to be replaced by an entrance reducer during winter months in colder climates.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to a condom for contraceptive and prophylactic use. In particular, this invention relates to an improved condom having a fluted, non-rolled design. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to overcoming problems associated with traditional thin membrane rolled condoms in the fight against sexually transmitted diseases, including the spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that can result in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), while improving sexual sensation for the user. Protection from sexually transmitted diseases is a public health concern that affects all people, regardless of sexual orientation, nationality and age group. Since the onset of AIDS in the early 1980s, the AIDS pandemic has particularly affected the gay community, with gay men comprising approximately two-thirds of all AIDS cases in the United States. However, an increasing number of heterosexual women and men have since become infected, especially among minorities. In the Sub-Sahara region women are disproportionately impacted by HIV/AIDS. In the fight against the spread of AIDS, the medical profession, as well as governmental and health organizations, have strongly advocated the use condoms to combat the transmission of HIV. Condoms are the only devices available now that provide triple protection against HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and pregnancy. Further, condoms are inexpensive, and have few side effects. However, while familiarity with condoms is high among most population groups and regions, condom usage, access, and availability around the world are currently inadequate. Condom usage is inadequate due to basic shortcomings of conventional condoms. Conventionally, condoms are of the common thin rolled variety, typically made of a thin, soft, flaccid material such as latex or polyurethane, or some type of animal intestine. The condom is typically made quite thin in order to provide acceptable tactile stimulation to transfer through the material for the active male user. However, because the condom is made as thin as possible to enhance transferred stimulation, it is susceptible to breakage, thereby exposing the user and the user&#39;s partner to sexually transmitted diseases or the risk of unplanned pregnancy. Studies have shown that commercial thin membrane latex male condoms can have a failure rate up to 18%. As such, thin rolled condoms have had an extensive history of consumer complaints regarding their effectiveness in preventing STIs and pregnancy. Thin rolled condoms have also had an extensive history of consumer dissatisfaction regarding their diminishment of pleasure. It is well known that the use of thin rolled condoms disrupt intimacy; they can pinch and snag the skin, desensitize the sexual experience and generally interfere with the overall pleasure associated with sex. But most importantly, thin rolled condoms diminish pleasure because they overlook the ‘fluid factor’. Heterosexual contact normally occurs in the wet, slippery, warm, environment of the vagina that stimulates the orgasmic response between partners. Thin rolled condoms do not permit direct or wet contact between partners to stimulate the orgasmic response. Thin condoms conventionally come in male and female varieties. A male condom is of the type worn on the penis by the active male partner during sexual intercourse. The traditional male condom has an elongated tubular sheath, which is open at one end for insertion of the penis, and closed at the other end to trap ejaculate of seminal fluids. A conventional male condom is donned by unrolling and stretching the sheath onto the erect penis fitting snuggly, end to end. In most varieties, the open end generally has a peripheral bead that functions as a constricted rim to prevent the condom from slipping off during use. Generally, the male condom is elastically fitted to cling to the penis tip, and during coitus it remains outstretched and taut, which can increase the hazard of the condom being torn or bursting during use. The structural integrity of the thin condom can also be compromised by leakage, slippage and viral penetration. Hence, male condoms are well known to be only partially effective in the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV. The CDC evaluates male condom effectiveness at a failure rate of up to 18%, when used correctly and consistently. Not only do traditional male condoms have an unacceptably high risk of failure, such condoms also suffer from a number of other shortcomings that can discourage their use entirely, thus diminishing their effectiveness in the fight against the spread of AIDS. One drawback is that the use of a condom can interrupt sexual intimacy because the condom has to be donned onto the erect penis after arousal. Another drawback is that after sexual intercourse is completed, the condom may slip off as the erect penis softens, which may cause unwanted leakage of semen and/or contamination. Yet another disadvantage of the traditional thin male condom is the loss of sensation experienced by the active male caused by the fact that the condom must be tight-fitting in order to stay in place. The conventional condom does not permit adequate sensitivity for the active male during sexual intercourse because it constricts sensation and ignores the fluid anatomy conditional to sexual intercourse. Also, because the rolled condom is fitted to move along clinging to the penis, it prevents direct fluid communication and tactile friction between the penis of the active partner and the vaginal or rectal wall of the passive partner during sexual intercourse. Not least, most traditional male condoms are typically constructed in a single, standard size, which does not accommodate penises of different sizes in length and girth. Such construction can be uncomfortable for the male wearer when the standard size will not fit. In addition to male condoms, there are also female condoms, which are barrier devices made to be worn internally by the female partner. The conventional female condom is typically comprised of a thin, pouch liner with a closed end and a large open end that is generally provided with a stiff outer ring, attached to hold the mouth of the liner open outside of the vagina and another inside, loose ring to position the closed end at the cervix. One of the many disadvantages of a female (i.e. receptive) condom is that there is a risk that the condom can slip or become dislodged during sexual intercourse. For a female condom to be an effective barrier to pregnancy and/or the transmission of sexual diseases, it is essential that, even during repeated and rigorous coitus, the penis does not penetrate the vagina outside the condom (side entry). Moreover, like most commercial male condoms, female condoms are commonly formed of latex, polyurethane, or nitrile. Because they are made of thin material, such condoms are flaccid and thus susceptible to irregular bunching during use, resulting in discomfort or generally poor performance. Moreover, such female condoms perform poorly, since their flaccid membranes do not have sufficient structural rigidity to maintain traction between the condom and the female vaginal cavity, which also could result in a risk of the penis penetrating the vagina outside the condom. Also, female condoms evaluated for efficacy by the CDC have up to a 21% failure rate when used correctly and consistently. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to provide a condom that is safer in terms of breakage, leakage, slippage, and viral permeability than available commercial condoms. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved condom for use in receptive intercourse, as either a male condom or a female condom.",

    "abstract": "This invention is a device for bridging the neck of a wide-necked or narrow-necked aneurysm in the vasculature. In general, it is a device used to stabilize aneurysms found in the vasculature by at least partially closing the opening to that aneurysm with consequent limiting of the amount of blood flowing into and out of the chamber. The device is generally made of a metallic or polymeric sheet and is of a shape which may be deployed using a catheter. The device typically has three major components or regions: the central area, the centrifugal stabilizers, and the axial stabilizers. The device is intended to be a permanent implant and may be used with or without occlusive devices and materials placed inside the aneurysm volume. It may be delivered by introduction through or on a catheter or via a delivery wire. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Various implantable medical devices have been developed for treating ailments in the vascular system. Vaso-occlusive devices have been used extensively in closing regions of the vascular system. These devices are especially useful in treating aneurysms. Vascular aneurysms are formed as a result of a weakening in the wall of an artery and subsequent ballooning of the artery wall. Aneurysms are often a site of internal bleeding and, catastrophically, the site of strokes. A variety of different embolic agents are known to be suitable for treatment of such aneurysms. These treatments are commonly known as &#34;artificial vaso-occlusion.&#34; One such class of embolic agents includes injectable fluids or suspensions, such as microfibrillar collagen, various polymeric beads, and polyvinyl alcohol foam. These polymeric agents may additionally be crosslinked, sometimes in vivo to extend the persistence of the agent at the vascular site. These agents may be introduced into the vasculature through a catheter. After such introduction, materials there form a solid space-filling mass. Although some such agents provide for excellent short-term occlusion, many are thought to allow vessel recanalization due to absorption of polymer into the blood. Another procedure in which a partially hydrolyzed polyvinyl acetate (PVA) is dissolved in ethanol solvent and injected into a desired vascular site is found in Park et al. (U.S. patent application Ser. No. 08/734,442, filed Oct. 17, 1996, for &#34;LIQUID EMBOLIC AGENTS&#34;). Other materials, such as hog hair and suspensions of metal particles have also been suggested and used by those wishing to form occlusions. Other materials, including polymeric resins, typically cyanoacrylates, are also employed as injectable vaso-occlusive materials. These resins are typically mixed with a radio-opaque contrast material or made radio-opaque by the addition of a tantalum powder. These materials are difficult to use in that the placement of the mixture in the body may be a problem. These materials cross-link within the human body. Inadvertent embolisms in normal vasculature, due to the inability of controlling the destination of the precursor resinous materials, is not uncommon. The material is also difficult or even impossible to retrieve once it has been placed into the vasculature. Over the past few years, advancements in the artificial occlusion of vessels and aneurysms has occurred mostly due to the improvements in delivery and implantation of metal coils as vaso-occlusive devices. Implantable metal coils that are useful in artificial occlusion devices in vasculature lumens or aneurysms are herein referred to as &#34;vaso-occlusive coils.&#34; Vaso-occlusive coils are generally constructed of wire, usually made of a metal or metal alloy, that is first wound into a helix. Many such devices are introduced to the selected target site through a catheter in a stretched linear form. The vaso-occlusive device may assume an irregular shape upon discharge of the device from the distal end of the catheter. A variety of vaso-occlusive coils and braids are known. For instance, U.S. Pat. No. 4,994,069, to Ritchart et al., shows a flexible, preferably coiled, wire for use in small vessel vaso-occlusion. These coils are described as being between 0.010 and 0.030 inches in diameter. The wire used to make up the coils may be, for instance, 0.002 to 0.006 inches in diameter. Tungsten, platinum, and gold threads or wires are said to be preferred. These devices may be used to fill aneurysms. It is common that these vaso-occlusive devices be delivered through microcatheters such as the type shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,739,768, to Engelson. These microcatheters track a guidewire to a point just proximal or within the desired occlusion site. The vaso-occlusive coils are then advanced through the microcatheter, once the guidewire is removed, and out the distal end hole so to at least partially fill the selected site and create occlusion within the aneurysm. In addition to the various types of space-filling mechanisms and geometries of vaso-occlusive coils, other particularize features of coil designs, such as mechanisms for delivering vaso-occlusive coils through delivery catheters and implanting them in desired occlusion sites, have also been described. Examples of such vaso-occlusive devices based upon their delivery mechanisms include pushable coils (see Ritchart et al., discussed above), mechanically detachable vaso-occlusive devices (see U.S. Pat. No. 5,261,916 to Engelson or U.S. Pat. No. 5,250,071 to Palermo), or electrolytically detachable vaso-occlusive devices (see U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,122,136 and 5,354,295 to Guglielmi et al.). Each of the devices described above may be used in the treatment, by occlusion, of aneurysms. As noted above, aneurysms present particularly acute medical risks due to the dangers of potential rupture of the thin wall inherent in such a vascular anomaly. Occlusion of aneurysms by the use of vaso-occlusive coils without occluding the adjacent artery is a special challenge. As noted above, the use of vaso-occlusive coils in treating aneurysms is widespread. These vaso-occlusive devices are placed in an aneurysm by the use of a microcatheter. The distal end of the microcatheter is advanced into the mouth of the aneurysm. The vaso-occlusive coil is then advanced through and out of that microcatheter. After, or perhaps during, delivery of such a coil into the aneurysm, there is a specific risk that a portion of the coil might migrate out of the aneurysm entrance zone and into the feeding vessel. The presence of such a coil in that feeding vessel may cause the undesirable response of causing an occlusion there. Also, there is a quantifiable risk that the blood flow in the vessel and the aneurysm may induce movement of the coil farther out of the aneurysm, resulting in a more thoroughly developed embolus in the patent vessel. Furthermore, one type of aneurysm, commonly known as a &#34;wide-neck aneurysm&#34; is known to present particular difficulty in the placement and retention of vaso-occlusive coils. Wide-neck aneurysms are herein referred to as aneurysms of vessel walls having a neck or a &#34;entrance zone&#34; from the adjacent vessel, which entrance zone has a diameter of either (1) at least 80% of the largest diameter of the aneurysm; or (2) is clinically observed to be too wide effectively to retain vaso-occlusive coils that are deployed using the techniques discussed herein. Furthermore, vaso-occlusive coils lacking substantial secondary shape strength may be difficult to maintain the position within an aneurysm no matter how skillfully they are placed. There are a few disclosed devices for maintaining the presence of vaso-occlusive coils within an aneurysm. One such device is shown in U.S. Ser. No. 08/690,183, filed Jul. 26, 1996 for &#34;ANEURYSM CLOSURE DEVICE ASSEMBLY&#34; (Attorney Docket No. 29025-20162.00). That patent describes a number of devices which are to be placed within the lumen of a feed vessel exterior to the aneurysm. It may be used to retain coils within the aneurysm cavity. One highly desired way of using the device is this: the retainer device is released into the vessel exterior to the aneurysm. The device is held in place via the presence of radial pressure on the vessel wall. After the device is released and set in an appropriate place, a microcatheter is inserted into the lumen so that the distal end of the catheter is inserted into the aneurysm cavity. One or more vaso-occlusive devices is then introduced into the aneurysm cavity. The retainer device maintains the presence of the vaso-occlusive devices within the aneurysm whether it is a large-mouth aneurysm or not. Other stents or grafts which may be used to seal the mouth of an aneurysm are shown, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 4,820,298, to Leveen et al.; U.S. Pat. No. 5,258,042 to Metha; and others. None of these devices are of the same configuration as that described herein. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention includes an implantable medical device useful for at least partially closing the opening to an aneurysm. It may further be used for retaining other occlusion devices within an aneurysm. The invention also relates to methods for introducing and installing the medical device at the selected site. In particular, the invention involves an implantable stent having a central closure area, opposing axially positioned struts extending from the closure area, and circumferential struts extending generally orthogonal to the axial struts. The device is desirably constructed from a metallic or polymeric sheet material and may be delivered using an intravascular catheter.",

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Ordinarily, after an offshore platform has fulfilled its use by extracting all the oil or gas it can from a given location, it is merely discarded. Typically, the platforms are removed to 15 feet below the mudline. Oil companies routinely pay millions of dollars to have the platforms removed and the platforms often become the property of the remover. Many of these platforms are lowered to the seabed in approved dumping sites and are in excellent condition. As a result, the platforms could be re-used for other purposes such as power generation.

No. 3,946,568 is directed to an offshore oil production platform comprising one section disposed on the sea bed and another section connected to the one section and projecting up above the sea surface. The one section consists of a plurality of prefabricated units comprising at least one tank divided into a plurality of compartments and having a peripheral wall the thickness of which is not adapted to withstand full water pressure with the tank empty in the submerged state, and at least one compartment in the tank has a peripherial wall the thickness of which is adapted to withstand full water pressure when empty in the submerged state. U.S. Pat. No. 5,188,484 is directed to a mobile, self-elevating, offshore production platform, for exploitation of smaller reservoirs, with a liquid tight hull having a deck; a plurality of support legs, each having a gear rack and bottom footpads, which are slidably extendable through the hull; a removable jacking tower for each support leg, and, a locking means for each support leg which is engageable to the leg gear rack at any vertical position of the leg. Mineral processing equipment is pre-installed on the deck at a suitable shoreside facility. Then the platform, with legs elevated, is towed to the offshore location where minerals are to be produced. On location the legs are lowered, grounded, and then pre-loaded to desired criteria by introducing ballast water into the hull. After pre-loading the platform is deballasted and elevated to establish a desired air gap. Upon elevation a locking device is engaged to secure each leg in place and the jacking towers, tower powering equipment, and ballast pumps may then be completely removed for storage, or reuse on other platforms. Installation is completed by connecting the hydrocarbon processing equipment to influent and effluent means provided. Upon depletion of the mineral reservoir, or for other reasons such as the threat of a violent storm, the platform can be removed from one location, and reused at another, by reversing and repeating the above procedure. U.S. Pat. No. 6,139,224 is directed to a semi-submersible platform for offshore oil operation comprising a buoyant sub-structure comprising a base and a plurality of columns upstanding from said base, a buoyant deck-hull mounted on the columns and means for ballasting and deballasting at least the base of said sub-structure. It further comprises means for tangentially guiding said deck-hull on said columns during deployment of the platform into a predetermined configuration by ballasting of the sub-structure while the deck-hull is floating and means for locking said deck-hull to the columns in said predetermined configuration. U.S. Pat. No. 5,573,355 is directed to an offshore oil drilling or producing platform comprising a hull carried by legs provided with feet adapted to rest on the sea bed, characterized in that the walls of each of the legs define a space opening onto the respective foot in which are retracted anchoring piles for the leg carried by the foot, each leg being also provided in its upper part with support means in vertical alignment with the piles within the space defined by the walls of the leg for supporting a device for driving the piles into the sea bed. U.S. Pat. No. 4,025,220 is directed to a fluid-current energy-conversion plant, especially useful for electricity generation, utilizing an axial flow turbine as the energy conversion element, has self-inflated flexible collector elements for capturing a portion of the fluid current, increasing its velocity, guiding at least some of each portion into the turbine&#39;s mouth, then returning the captured flow into the stream. None of the above inventions provide a re-usable offshore oil platform to provide an alternative energy source. It would therefore be beneficial if an alternative energy source utilizing the re-use of decommissioned oil platforms existed to harness energy.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to hyperbaric chamber devices and, more particularly, to hyperbaric chamber devices which are portable, disposable and adapted for use in connection with irregular portions of the human body. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Hyperbaric chambers are devices which create sealed environments for the application of therapeutic gases to hasten healing of lesions or wounds on a patient&#39;s body. The introduction of pressurized oxygen into such an encapsulated environment promotes healing of various types of lesions and wounds. Specifically, it has been discovered that the treatment of lesions and wounds with hyperbaric chambers, in conjunction with various stimuli, promotes granulation, raises the capillary blood p 02 , elevates the Redox potential and suppresses bacterial proliferation. It has been determined that a constant pressure of 22-26 mmHG (1.03 atmospheres) and flow rates of 2 to 8 liters per minute are preferred. The introduction of humidity into hyperbaric chambers also produces positive results. When hyperbaric chambers were first introduced they encompassed large portions of the patient&#39;s body. As time progressed, hyperbaric chambers became more sophisticated and topical hyperbaric chambers were developed. A topical hyperbaric chamber is a device which only encapsulates a small portion of the user&#39;s body. As these devices have evolved though, it has become apparent that significant shortcomings continue to exist. These shortcomings include the failure of the art to provide a convenient portable hyperbaric unit, a portable hyperbaric unit which is capable of producing a hermetic seal in many applications, a portable hyperbaric unit which is affordable, and a portable hyperbaric unit which is disposable. The present invention provides advancements in these areas. In particular it is an object of the present invention to provide a topical hyperbaric apparatus capable of adapting to various contours of the human body. It is another object of the present invention to provide such an apparatus which is convenient to use and fully portable. A further object of the present invention is to provide such an apparatus at a cost which will enable wider use and, in the proper case, disposability; such disposability being a significant improvement and widely acknowledged as necessary in facilities which treat large numbers of patients. Prior to the present invention, portable hyperbaric units were available, but these units failed to solve many of the presently addressed problems. For instance, in Lasley, U.S. Pat. No. 4,509,513, the patient is apparently required to stand during treatment. This is at times a sufficient enough requirement to preclude the use of this device. The &#39;513 device is also constructed to encompass a large portion of the patient&#39;s body. This requires a relatively significant amount of oxygen and exposes areas of the body which do not require treatment to the negative effects of the therapeutic atmosphere, such as drying. LoPiano, U.S. Pat. No. 4,328,799, discloses a device which treats only a small area of the patient&#39;s body and, therefore, solves the problem of unduly exposing healthy parts of the patient&#39;s body to the drying effects of the therapeutic atmosphere. However, this device fails to provide adequate seals during various applications. This poor sealing is significant because many of the areas of the body where such poor sealing occurs are areas which are highly susceptible to treatable lesions, such as bedsores on the buttock. This poor sealing is the result of both the inherent design of the device and movements of the patient. The inherent sealing limitations of this device result from the sealing apparatus which it utilizes. This sealing apparatus is in fact comprised of the patient&#39;s body, the bed frame or suitable other securing means and a feathered edge flange which expands and seals against the patient&#39;s body when the appropriate treating atmosphere is introduced into the chamber itself. This feathered flange is suited for producing a seal only on areas of the body which are basically flat. This device is not suitable for use in the area of bony protrusions or other irregularities in the surface of the skin, such as the division between buttock. This is a significant limitation. Lasley, U.S. Pat. No. 4,474,571, discloses a portable topical hyperbaric chamber similar to the LoPiano patent. This device alleviates the need for cumbersome securing means by introducing a belting means in conjunction with a more resilient feathered flange sealing means. This device though, as discussed in relation to the &#39;513 patent, similarly suffers from the shortcomings of the feathered flange sealing means; and similarly is only effective on portions of the body which do not exhibit surface irregularities. Accordingly, there is a need for an improved portable hyperbaric chamber which is capable of being effectively applied to the less easily treatable area of the human body. This is a significant need because, as previously stated, bedsores and the like typically occur in the non-planar areas of the human body. SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION The present invention addresses the aforementioned problems. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, an improved sealing apparatus is provided. More particularly, the hyperbaric apparatus includes a shell having at least one wall which provides an external surface and defines and internal chamber. An opening is provided through the wall which communicates with the internal chamber. Disposed on the external circumference of this opening is an adhesive sealing material which is adapted to adhesively seal this internal chamber to the patient&#39;s body. When this shell is thus affixed to the patient&#39;s body, there is provided a substantially closed internal chamber in communication with the area to be treated. There is also provided, and communicating with the substantially closed internal chamber, gas introduction means for introducing therapeutic gases into the chamber. Such gas introduction means allow for therapeutic gases, such as pressurized O 2 , to be introduced within this chamber with the result of bringing such gases into contact with the portions of the patient&#39;s body to be treated. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a hyperbaric apparatus having a shell which includes at least one wall providing an external surface and defining a substantially closed internal chamber within this shell. The at least one wall includes a substantially flexible portion capable of conforming to irregularly shaped surfaces of a patient&#39;s body, and has an opening therethrouqh which communicates with the internal chamber. Lining the internal chamber is a substantially gas impermeable material which in turn creates a gas impermeable internal chamber. There is also provided a gas introduction means which allows therapeutic gases, such as pressurized O 2 , to be introduced within this chamber and in turn come into contact with the portions of the patient&#39;s body to be treated. In addition to improved sealing means and flexible shell apparatus in the environment of hyperbaric chambers, the present invention also provides an improved method of therapeutically treating wounds and sores. More particularly, in accordance with this aspect of the present invention, the method comprises the steps of affixing a hyperbaric chamber apparatus to a patient&#39;s body through the use of an adhesive sealing means. The adhesive sealing means allows for attachment without pressurization or belting means, although such belting means may be used to further buttress such adhesive attachment. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention there is provided an improved method of application as a result of the flexibility of the hyperbaric chamber apparatus itself. In particular such flexibility enables a method of treatment wherein the hyperbaric chamber apparatus conforms to irregularly shaped portions of the patient&#39;s body and as a result seals the areas to be treated. This enables the treatment of wound sites heretofore effectively untreatable by existing devices. In addition to the treatment of wound sites previously untreatable in the absence of a much more cumbersome device, numerous benefits flow from the present invention, such as portability, hermetic sealing in a portable device, and lower cost. Such lower cost in turn produces another set of benefits, such as wider availability and use, application in areas where it was previously economically inefficient, and disposability. Finally, such disposability in turn produces yet another set of benefits, such as reduction of &#34;down time&#34; per unit, reduction of sterilization needs and infection control.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates generally to burial caskets, and more particularly to a casket with a memorabilia compartment forming a part thereof. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Currently caskets, whether fabricated from wood or metal, do not provide any designated, easily accessible, receptacle or compartment for either the placement of personal effects of the deceased therein or the inclusion therein of mementos of memorialization by the deceased&#39;s family and friends. Prior attempts at solving this shortcoming have generally taken the form of the placement of a small memento box into the casket alongside the deceased. However, such memento boxes often appear as an afterthought, simply placed alongside the deceased in the casket somewhat haphazardly. Thus, no designated receptacle or compartment which is an integral part of the casket has been provided which could be utilized by the family to commemorate the passing of the deceased. It is therefore the main objective of the present invention to provide a casket having a memorabilia compartment which is a designated compartment or receptacle specifically for mementos which is an integral part of the casket and which does not present the haphazard appearance of prior memento boxes simply placed alongside the deceased in the casket. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention attains the stated objective by providing a casket with an integral memorabilia compartment for the placement, display and storage therein of personal effects and mementos of memorialization of the deceased. In one form the casket comprises a shell, a cap pivoted to the shell, and an openable and closable memorabilia compartment forming a part or the cap. In another form the casket comprises a shell, a cap pivoted to the shell, and an openable and closable memorabilia compartment forming a part of the shell.

    "abstract": "The present invention mechanically segregates failure particles from wear particles thus increasing the reliability and accuracy of the detection of the failure particles by conventional detection equipment. The invention is further adapted so as to include means for removing air and other entrapped gases from the fluid. The invention includes two inner hollow cylindrical tubes which are encompassed by and connected to an outer cylindrical housing. The first of these tubes enters from the top of the housing and extends only part way toward the bottom of the housing. This serves as the air outlet. The second inner tube enters from the bottom of the housing and is the oil outlet. The lubricating fluid enters tangentially the top of the housing and cyclonically works its way around both of the inner tubes to the bottom of the housing in a spiral flow pattern where it then rises to and enters the top of the second tube from which it exits the housing. The top of this tube is shrouded to prevent any substantial loss of oil into gas outlet. The housing further contains a detection cavity formed at its bottom at or near its periphery for receiving failure particles. While normal wear particles, which are suspended in the fluid travel along with it, the heavier failure particles are forced against the inner surface of the housing by centrifugal force and then down to the bottom of the housing where they are thrust into the detection cavity. Conventional magnetic particle detection equipment is contained within this cavity which is also adapted to indicate the presence of the subject failure particles. The cyclonic motion of the oil also serves to separate out the gases. This happens because the foam has a lower specific gravity than the oil, and is therefore, subject to substantially lower centrifugal force. Consequently the gas forms a column in the center of the housing as the oil rotates around the upper inner cylinder and is captured by the gas collector. The gas may be vented through the use of an external pressure valve thereby permitting the lubrication system pressure to be maintained. Accordingly, it is the object of the present invention to provide an apparatus which will separate failure particles from wear particles and which will separate entrapped gases in the fluid of a lubricating system for mechanical drive systems. It is another object of the present invention to provide means for separating failure particles from wear particles and entrapped gases in the fluid of lubrication systems, wherein centrifugal force is used to provide such separation.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to a medical insufflating apparatus, and more specifically to a nasal cannula apparatus having one or more adjustable members which allows a wearer to manually position and maintain fluid supply tubing away from substantially contacting the ears of the wearer. Nasal cannula apparatus provides the wearer with supplemental fluids, typically, but not exclusively, oxygen, to help compensate for reduced pulmonary function arising from such diseases as emphysema, severe bronchitis and other cardiopulmonary maladies caused by disease progression or trauma. In the relevant art, the nasal cannula are typically held in place by having one or more fluid supply tubes rest upon the upper surfaces of the ears and sides of the head adjacent to the ears as a means of support. In many cases, the nasal cannula must be worn for prolonged periods of time which results in significant irritation, ulceration and possible microbial infection of the skin at the points of contact with the ears and sides of the head. Moreover, many of these unfortunate individuals require the supplemental fluids to be provided at all times for their very survival. As such, the wounds induced by the fluid supply tubes have little chance to heal. An example of a very common nasal cannula arrangement is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,106,505 to Salter, et al., which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. The invention to Salter attempts to solve a significant contact irritation problem which occurs at the nostrils and upper lip of the wearer. While the nostril area is more prone to irritation due to moisture, greater concentrations of invasive bacteria and friction transferred to the cannula by the wearer&#39;s head movements, this common arrangement transfers the contact irritation problem from the nostril area to portions of the ears and sides of the wearer&#39;s head and is therefore not a complete solution for those individuals requiring constant fluid supplementation or otherwise have skin sensitized to the plastics used to form the fluid supply tubes. Therefore, there is a need for a nasal cannula apparatus which is repositionable by the wearer to a more comfortable position about the head of the wearer.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a health care equipment, particularly to a human spine rehabilitation exercise device. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART As an axial skeleton of a human being, spine (also known as backbone), called “the second lifeline of human body” by medical experts, not only has functions of supporting the body and buffering the stress and shock on the body, but also is a support center of chest and abdomen with functions of protecting visceral organs of chest and abdomen and spinal cord, therefore, the importance of the spine to human heath is self-evident. For most people, one of the main causes of spinal injury is keeping a post unchanged for a long time. For example, people, working over a desk, generally sit in front of a computer for a long time. Keeping the head forward becomes a normal state both in work and life, which brings large loads to the spine; as a result, it is likely to cause spinal abnormality. Spinal abnormality may not only cause neck pain, shoulder pain, back pain and numbness of limb, but also affect blood vessels near the spine and disrupt nerves managing the viscera, thereby resulting in disorder of breath, digestion, circulation and other systemic functions. Consequently, many people are in ailment or sub-health status, and the quality of work and life is influenced seriously. To prevent and treat various spinal diseases, there has been various health care appliances and medical facilities for massaging the spine in the prior art. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 6,899,688 disclosed a cervical spine massager, the massager has a driving device, two shaft seats are disposed on the driving device, and each of the shaft seats is provided with a shaft lever in connection with a roll sleeve; and when the driving device moves, the roll sleeves can move along the curve of the cervical spine of the user, which meets the requirement of the physiological radian of the human cervical spine, so that the user is allowed to be massaged comfortably. Furthermore, Chinese Utility Model Patent No. CN202342417U (Patent No.: ZL201120385769.1), entitled “Human Spine Curve Massager”, disclosed a human spine curve massager, where the human spine curve massager consists of a soleplate, a massage block and a supporting block fixed on the soleplate, and an electronic oscillator; the upper surfaces of the massage block and the supporting block form a curved surface similar to the human spinal curve; and, when a person lies on the massager on his back, the spine may be in a completely relaxed state, at this moment, the tired and sore parts are massaged using the massage block in the presence of high frequency pulse current generated by the electronic oscillator, accompanied by radio wave stimulation for physiotherapy, thereby generating excellent effects in relieving fatigue and pains. However, the massages described in the above patents have a common problem that they need to be connected to a power supply when in service. The action of the massagers is to be driven by a motor or generated by an electronic oscillator. Once the electronic circuit is damaged or breaks down, the massagers are unable to operate normally so that the service life of the massagers is limited by electronic equipment. Furthermore, a risk of current leakage of the electronic equipment may cause safety problems in service. Second, massagers applying an electronic driving device generally have large size, complicated structure and poor mobility and portability, thereby resulting inflexible use. In addition, when the massagers described in the above patents are in service, generally, the position of a person is kept unmoved relatively while the massage heads on the massagers do reciprocating motion, so that only parts of acupuncture points of cervical spine or spine can be massaged passively, and the active training and exercise to intraspinal nerves and visceral organs in the chest and abdomen cannot be further realized. The effect of comprehensive health care is not ideal. Hence, in order to solve the problems existed in the above patents and achieve the purpose of optimizing the structure and improving the health care effect, such massagers need to be further improved. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide a spine rehabilitation exercise device with simple structure, flexible use and high safety in view of the current situation in the prior art. For achieving the above stated object, the spine rehabilitation exercise device comprises: a soleplate; and an exercise mechanism disposed on the soleplate, wherein the exercise mechanism comprises a sliding mechanism movably disposed on the soleplate; a supporting base with an arc-shape bottom surface movably mounted on top of the sliding mechanism, the supporting base being capable of rocking on top of the sliding mechanism and moving horizontally and in line together with the sliding mechanism on the soleplate; a pillow, with a curve top surface matching a natural physical curvature of human spine, mounted on the supporting base; and an elastic assembly disposed between the pillow and the supporting base, which enables the pillow to have a trend of bouncing upward all the time. In order to ensure that the exercise device can slide in line on the soleplate and to realize movement limit, preferably, the sliding mechanism further comprises a slider, the slider has a bottom and a limiting mechanism for limiting movement of the slider on the soleplate, the bottom of the slider is provided with a rolling assembly, the supporting base is movably mounted on the slider, and the rolling assembly enables the sliding mechanism to slide in line on the soleplate. In order to realize the movably connection of the supporting base on the slider and to ensure the normal restoration of the supporting base after rocking, preferably, the supporting base has at least one pin hole, the slider has at least one connecting hole, each pin hole matching a connecting hole, and at least one pin passing through one pin hole and a corresponding connecting hole for connecting the supporting base to the slider, the at least one pin has a head and is fitted with a first spring with two ends, one end of the first spring presses against the head of the at least one pin and other end of the first spring presses against inside of the pin hole, and the first spring enables the at least one pin to move upward when the supporting base rocks and restores the at least one pin to a previous position when the supporting base is standing still. The in-line movement of the slider on the soleplate may be realized in multiple ways, for example, by matching of slide rails and guide slots, matching of lead screws and screw rods, etc. Preferably, in the present application, a rolling assembly is employed to realize the in-line movement. The rolling assembly comprises at least one ball seating and a plurality of balls placed inside the at least one ball seating, and the bottom of the slider is provided with at least one groove for receiving the at least one ball seating, the at least one ball seating is provided with a plurality of linearly aligned pores, each pore enabling one ball to touch the soleplate. Hence, the rolling contact between the slider and the soleplate may be realized by the balls, so that it is more convenient and strength-saving for the movement of the slider, and the flexibility of the movement of the slider is improved. In order to prevent the slider from moving outside the soleplate, the route of back-and-forth movement of the slider on the soleplate is limited. Preferably, the limiting mechanism further comprises a stopping block with a shaft hole and a sliding shaft passing through the shaft hole, the stopping block is fixed on the soleplate; and the bottom of the slider is provided with a limiting recess having two end walls for limiting the stopping block when the slider slides on the soleplate, the stopping block and a sliding shaft are disposed within the limiting recess, and two ends of the sliding shaft are positioned at two end walls of the limiting recess. When the slider slides in-line movement on the soleplate, the movement of the slider may be limited as the two end walls of the limiting recess are pressed against the two ends of the stopping block, so that the slider is ensured to perform in-line reciprocating movement on the soleplate within a certain route range. In order to reduce the direct collision between the limiting recess and the stopping block, lower the noise and prolong the service life of the slider, preferably, the limiting recess further comprises two shockproof pads for pressing against the stopping block, each shockproof pad disposed at one end wall of the limiting recess, and each shockproof pad has a positioning hole for receiving the sliding shaft. In order to be convenient to adjust the resistance when the slider slides on the soleplate, preferably, the stopping block further comprising a damping adjustment hole is formed at a bottom of the stopping block communicating with the shaft hole, the soleplate is provided with a through hole, and a damper, inserted through the through hole and the damping adjustment hole, for adjusting the gap between the sliding shaft and the shafting hole. In order to simplify the structure and to be convenient for assembling and disassembling, preferably, the elastic assembly further comprises at least one spring seat with a top and at least one second spring, the top of the at least one spring seat is connected to the pillow, at least one stand column extending downwardly from the at least one spring seat, the supporting base is further provided with at least one cylindrical hole for receiving the at least one stand column, the cylindrical hole further has a positioning column, and the at least one second spring engages the stand column and the positioning column.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a machine for harvesting fruits, berries and the like, from fruit trees and bushes planted in rows, and more particularly, although not exclusively, to a machine for harvesting grapes. However, the machine of the present invention equally well is capable of being used for harvesting other fruits and berries, for example black currants, gooseberries, raspberries or coffee beans. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Most conventional grape-picking machines use practically the same principle for harvesting grapes. This principle consists of beating or shaking the vines by imparting sinusoidal or pseudo-sinusoidal motion thereto at an amplitude and at a frequency suitable for causing the grapes or the bunches of grapes to become detached. This motion is transmitted to the vine via shaker or beater members disposed in such a manner as to act either on the vinestock or stem or else on the vegetation, i.e. on the fruit-bearing portion of the vine, depending on the type and number of shaker or beater members used. The percentage of bunches and/or individual grapes which are detached from the vines depends on the number and the amplitude of the oscillations to which a given bunch of grapes is subjected. The more energetic the shaking to which a given bunch of grapes is subjected, and the more frequently it is shaken, the more likely said bunch or its individual grapes are to become detached from the vine. The number and the amplitude of the above oscillations depend on various parameters that may be selected, in particular on the amplitude and the frequency of the drive mechanism associated with the shaker or beater members, on the length of the active shaking zone of said shaker or beater members, on the stiffness or the flexibility thereof, and on the speed at which the machine advances, together with other factors which are imposed by the vine itself, in particular the way it is trained, its shape, and the resistance it gives to the motions of the beater or shaker members. However, simultaneously with causing bunches of grapes and individual grapes to become detached, the shaker or beater members, when too energetically moved, may damage the vines, at least to some extent, which may be detrimental to the health of the crop. It is therefore generally necessary to find a compromise between the various above-mentioned parameters in order to obtain an acceptable percentage of harvested grapes or bunches of grapes without giving rise to unacceptable damage to the vines. The foregoing notwithstanding, certain types of grape vines, such as the goblet-shaped vines for example, present a dense vegetation to the shaker or beater members rendering it difficult for said members to obtain a sufficient penetration in case the energetic value of the shaking or beating action would be too low, whereby the percentage of unharvested grapes would be unacceptable. Under such conditions, one of the parameters of importance is the number of the oscillations of the shaker and beater members acting on a given grape vine and therefore increasing the shaking or beating frequency could present a solution to overcome the above drawback. Also, in case the operating speed and hence the capacity of the harvester is to be increased while still subjecting each grape vine to a given number of oscillations, the shaking or beating frequency again has to be increased. It is experienced however that, in practice, most shaking or beating members which consist of solid rods made of a flexible material, are normally already operating at a frequency close to the resonance frequency of the rods, implying that any further increase in the operating frequency most likely would result in the rods going into resonance whereby the speed of displacement of said rods as well as the real amplitude of their motion are no longer controlled and no longer correspond to the speed and amplitude of the reciprocating drive mechanism associated with said rods. As a result, when the shaker or beater members start to &#34;race&#34;, an uncontrollable deformation of the rods would occur, leading to damage of the vines and ultimately to the rupture of the rods. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore the objective of the present invention to provide shaker or beater rods of which the resonance frequency, relative to presently used rods, is increased allowing higher operating frequencies to be used. According to the present invention, a machine is provided for harvesting fruits, berries and the like, from fruit trees and bushes planted in rows, the machine comprising a straddling chassis capable of moving across a field, a shaker assembly mounted on the chassis and including at least one pair of elongated shaker members which extend generally in the longitudinal direction of the machine and which are spaced transversely from one another and situated respectively on opposite sides of the central fore-and-aft axis of the machine so as to define an active shaking zone, each shaker member being formed by a rod of flexible material, and a control mechanism operatively connected to the rods to drive them synchronously with a reciprocating motion in a direction extending transversely relative to said fore-and-aft axis. The machine is characterized in that each rod comprises at least one cavity to reduce the weight thereof. Preferably, the cavity is in the form of a central, cylindrical bore extending in the longitudinal direction of the rod. The rod ends are closed by plug members to prevent any material to accumulate in the bore. The foregoing and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will appear more fully hereinafter from a consideration of the detailed description which follows, in conjunction with the accompanying sheets of drawings wherein one principal embodiment of the invention is illustrated by way of example. It is to be expressly understood, however, that the drawings are for illustrative purposes and are not to be construed as defining the limits of the invention.",

    "abstract": "The present invention is directed to a modular race track for remote control toy vehicles. The race track includes a plurality of interlocking polymer foam mats having soft side foam rails. The race track sections include different side rail configurations such as straight rail, inside corner, outside corner, and side bump rail. The sections can be assembled by a user to form a variety of different race track layouts. The race track is set up so that the entire periphery of the race track is guarded by side rails so that the remote control toy vehicles cannot leave the race track. The side rails both prevent the remote control vehicles from leaving the race track, and can also serve to guide the vehicles upon the race track by forming a central barrier. The present invention gives the user a product which won&#39;t damage or scratch most toy plastic vehicles and will keep most small remote control vehicles from exiting the track when in contact with a side border. The different track configuration pieces allow each user to create his or her own custom track layout. The track sets up very easily and can be stored in a very small space. The material of the track can hold up to most weather related exposures. Different track surface textures include an off road bumpy surface, a smooth flat surface, and a roughened friction enhancing surface. It may be appreciated that the track sections of the present invention may be sold separately, or may be sold in a kit which can be configured into one or more race track layouts. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the invention, a method for constructing a race track for remote control toy vehicles includes the steps of: (a) providing a plurality of interlockable mats, each mat having a top surface;   (b) providing a corresponding plurality of side rails, a side rail attached to the top surface of each mat and extending upwardly therefrom, each side rail and mat pair forming a race track segment; and,   (c) arranging the race track segments by interlocking the mats to form a race track, the arrangement being made such that the perimeter of the race track is completely bordered by side rails. In accordance with an aspect of the invention: in (b), a first configuration race track segment including: a mat having three interlockable sides and one straight side;   a straight side rail disposed along the straight side of the mat; and,   the first configuration race track segment positionable along either the perimeter of the race track or in the interior of the race track.",

    "abstract": "The present invention (RMP) shows significant advantages over existing treatment options. In contrast to blood bank products, (a) RMP have indefinite shelf-life with room temperature storage and does not need to be stored in blood banks; (b) RMP produced from type O Rh negative red cells (universal RMP) can be administered immediately without cross-matching; and (c) RMP can often substitute for blood-bank products. In addition, use of autologous RMP (made from patient&#39;s own blood), can be used to eliminate major risks of transfusion complications. RMP have many advantages as hemostatic agents, inter alia: (1) Ease and Economy of Production. Red cells (RBC) are by far the most abundant blood cells, assuring an essentially unlimited and economical source for RMP production. A single conventional blood donation (500 mL) is sufficient to produce RMP to treat at least two patients. Out-dated RBC in the blood bank, which is otherwise discarded, can be used as a source of RMP production. (2) Minimal Immune Reactions. RBCs are the least immunogenic and safe to transfuse to type compatible recipients. RMP produced from universal donors (type O, Rh negative) can be stored and safely infused into patients of any blood type. This is not the case of other blood cells such as platelets. (3) Autologous Option. RMP can be made from the patient&#39;s own blood and infused back to the original donors when they bleed or are at high risk of bleeding. The use of autologous RMP will eliminate complications of allogeneic blood transfusion. This option is well suited to patients who anticipate bleeding problems such as prior to surgery or diagnostic or therapeutic invasive procedures or chemotherapy which often induces bone marrow failure and severe thrombocytopenia. Systemic diseases may also result in thrombocytopenia. Those who take anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs or agents frequently suffer bleeding complications. They can prepare their own autologous RMP to be used safely in case of bleeding. In addition, religious groups which refused normal transfusion could benefit by this option.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to implantable medical devices. In particular, the invention is directed to a composite implantable medical device having an implantable tissue repair component and a component that assists in deployment of the tissue repair component at a surgical site and is subsequently removed by being bioabsorbed. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Implantable medical devices designed to help repair damaged tissues have been successfully used for years. Some of these devices are used to patch damaged tissue and provide mechanical support to the tissues during healing. A simple form of these devices is a flexible patch-like sheet. The composition and morphology of the sheets are usually tailored to address a particular surgical need. In some cases, it is desirable to incorporate a reinforcing element into the flexible sheets. In addition to mechanical support, reinforcing elements often assist in handling and deployment of the implantable sheet devices. Ease of handling and deployment of flexible sheet devices are particularly desired when laproscopic instruments and procedures are used to implant the devices. An example of one of these devices is disclosed by de la Torre in U.S. Pat. No. 5,368,602. de la Torre describes a patch made of a surgical mesh material having one or more semi-rigid frame-like support elements permanently secured to the mesh material along all or part of the border of the material. The semi-rigid support members are said to enable manipulation and positioning of the entire mesh area with conventional laproscopic instruments. U.S. Pat. No. 5,695,525, issued to Mulhauser et al., discloses a semi-rigid framework in the form of a ring permanently attached to one side of a planar mesh material. The support ring is designed to prevent the planar mesh material from collapsing into crater-like defects in tissue by maintaining the mesh material in an expanded configuration across the defect site. A repair patch similar to the Mulhauser et al. device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,824,082, issued to Brown. The Brown patch utilizes a framework made of a metallic support wire. The support wire has shape-memory properties. The support wire is permanently attached to a preformed patch material along its periphery. The shape-memory characteristic of the support wire enables the repair patch to be rolled into a small cylindrical profile at room temperatures and alter its configuration to expand and flatten the patch material at body temperatures. The repair patch is said to reside between layers of tissue at a repair site and not require sutures or staples. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,280,453, issued to Kugel et al., a hernia repair patch is disclosed having the form of a laminated mesh material with a framework made of a resilient monofilament spring permanently located between layers of the laminate. Once the patch is placed through an incision site in a hernia patient, the spring element assists in unfolding and expanding the patch into a planar configuration. The patch is provided with a pouch into which a surgeon can place a finger to position the patch across a hernia, rather than having to use a laproscopic instrument to position the patch. A variation on the theme of implantable tissue repair devices having permanently attached reinforcing frameworks is disclosed by Gianturco in U.S. Pat. No. 5,258,000. The Gianturco device is initially implanted as an unsupported flexible bag having an internal space into which an elastic stiffener wire is subsequently threaded. The stiffener wire causes the bag to adopt a flattened shape. The flattened repair device with its stiffener wire is permanently secured to tissue surrounding the repair site with sutures or staples. In surgical procedures that utilize a tissue repair material with a stiffener element, it may be desirable to remove the stiffener element from the repair material following at least partial attachment of the repair material to tissues of the repair site. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,370,650, issued to Tovey et al., an apparatus for positioning tissue repair meshes adjacent to body tissue is disclosed. The apparatus includes a delivery device with an arm that extends to place the tissue repair mesh into a surgical site. The arm has a stiffener element for the tissue repair mesh attached to its distal end. The tissue repair mesh is secured to the stiffener element with sutures sewn around the stiffener element and through holes in the mesh. The sutures can be sewn in such a way as to permit removal of the sutures from the tissue repair mesh following deployment. Prior to removal of the sutures from the mesh material, at least a portion the mesh material can be secured to tissues of the surgical site with sutures or staples. Once the tissue repair mesh is in place, the sutures holding the mesh to the stiffener element are removed. The delivery device is then separated from the tissue repair mesh and extracted from the surgical site. A pneumatically operated deployment device for a tissue repair mesh is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,302,897, issued to Rousseau. The Rousseau device is an applicator with a tissue repair mesh simply placed on an external surface of an inflatable bladder. The bladder has two portions. The first portion is filled with air. The second portion is initially empty, but is fillable with the air from the first portion when external mechanical pressure is applied to the first portion. As the second portion is inflated, the applicator and tissue repair mesh are unfolded and the repair mesh pressed against a patient&#39;s tissue. Following deployment of the mesh, the bladder is removed from the surgical site by hand. Farnsworth, et al. in U.S. Patent Publication No. 2004/0019360 disclose a tissue implant reinforced with a removable support member. The removable support member aids in placement and deployment of the tissue implant at an implantation site. The tissue implant and removable support member are both made of non-bioabsorbable materials. In some applications, it would be useful to eliminate the need to remove a reinforcing member from a tissue repair device or material. In U.S. Pat. No. 6,599,323, Melican, et al. disclose a bioabsorbable tissue implant reinforced with a component that can be bioabsorbable for use in pelvic floor repair. The tissue implant comprises one or more layers of a bioabsorbable polymeric foam having pores with an open cell structure. The tissue implant is in the form of a porous foam material. The foam component is integrated with the reinforcing component such that the pores of the foam component penetrate the mesh of the reinforcing component and interlock with the reinforcing component. Melican et al., teach implants, such as patches, made from non-bioabsorbable material are undesirable, however. None of these devices recognize the advantages of providing a non-bioabsorbable implantable sheet material with a resilient support member that is bioabsorbable. Such a device would have an adhesion scheme that permits the resilient support member to be initially held in place on the implantable sheet material with sufficient strength to withstand placement within and delivery from a laproscopic or similar surgical instrument. Yet the resilient support member would be removed from the implantable sheet material through a bioabsorption process and would not require further surgical procedures to remove the support member from the surgical site. The bioabsorbable resilient support member would assist in changing the implantable sheet material from a compacted configuration to a more planar configuration. The support member could also provide an unobstructed border area in which a complete set of sutures or staples encompassing the non-bioabsorbable repair material could be put in place and tested. Such a device would optionally include features that assist in tactile and visual orientation of the device at a surgical site. The bio-absorbable support member could be combined with bioactive compounds that would be released at the implantation site independently or in combination with bioabsorption of the support member. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a medical device for use in repair or reconstruction of damaged tissue as well as other surgical procedures. The device is particularly suited for repair of hernias and similar tissue damage requiring surgical placement and fixation of a patch-like material at the repair site. A bio-absorbable support member is attached to the patch-like device to enable a rolled device to unroll, or self-expand, at an implantation site without the need for an extrinsically applied force or a thermal transition of the support member material. The invention has two principle components. One component is an implantable device made of a non-bioabsorbable material, preferably in a planar form. The other component is a resilient polymeric support member made of a bioabsorbable material designed to assist in deployment and positioning of the implantable device at a surgical site. The bioabsorbable resilient support member is attached to the implantable device in such a way as to permit bioabsorption of the support member by the body of the implant recipient. The resilient support member is bioabsorbed by enzymatic action and/or hydrolysis of the polymeric material comprising the support member through physiological processes of the implant recipient. As a consequence, removal of the support member from the implantable device does not require a further surgical step, or procedure. The bioabsorbale resilient support member is also preferred in planar form. The combined planar materials are sufficiently pliable to permit the invention ( FIG. 4A ) to be rolled, folded, or otherwise compacted in form ( FIG. 4B ) and delivered with laproscopic instruments or other conventional surgical techniques. Following delivery of the invention to a surgical site, the bioabsorbable resilient support member readily recovers from the compacted form to substantially return to its original planar form. As the support member returns to its original planar form, the resilience of the support member causes the attached implantable device to readily change from the compacted form to the original planar configuration. As the invention assumes a planar form at a surgical site ( FIG. 4C , arrow ( 144 )), the bioabsorbable support member enables the implantable sheet material to be easily manipulated, positioned, and secured to tissues of the surgical site with surgical fasteners ( 146 ), which may be positioned by a surgical needle ( 175 ) ( FIG. 4D ). Once the implantable device is secured, the surgical procedure is concluded. In preferred embodiments, the bioabsorbable support member is sized to entirely cover the non-bioabsorbable implantable sheet material ( FIG. 3 ). In other embodiments, the bioabsorbable support member covers only part of the surface area of the implantable device ( FIGS. 2 ,  2 A,  2 B,  5 - 7 , et al.). This leaves the border area of the implantable device exposed and available for fixation with sutures, staples, tacks, or other surgical fasteners. In these and other embodiments, the present invention can have letters, numbers, and other characters or features that aid in visual orientation of the invention with respect to a surgical repair site. A particularly preferred visual aid involves the use of different colors for the implantable device and the support member. In addition to the visual aids, the support member can be constructed to provide tactile distinctions between different sides of the invention as well as tactile distinctions between the implantable device and the support member.",

It is another object of the present invention to provide a starter device for a toy engine which enhances the play value of the toy. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a starter device for a toy engine which heightens a user&#39;s interest in the toy. To achieve the foregoing and other objects of the present invention there is provided a drum member journalled to a rotary shaft that is rotatably mounted on a frame; a rope having an outer end with a grip; the rope being locked to the drum member; and a return spring disposed to urge the rope in a winding direction. A gear adapted to be rotated a predetermined angle by pulling the above-mentioned rope is loosely fitted on one of end of the rotary shaft, and a projection adapted to be engaged with a rotary lever for opening a main switch each time it rotates by one revolution is provided on the gear. A base of a rotary arm having a forward end to which a rotary gear meshed with the gear journalled to the rotary shaft is fitted is loosely fitted to the other end of the rotary shaft, and therefore the rotary gear is rotated by pulling the grip so as to be engaged with a transmission gear in the above-mentioned drive mechanism to actuate a starter switch, thereby the drive mechanism is driven for a short time. The drum member is rotated by pulling the grip so as to rotate the rotary gear attached to one end of the rotary shaft to which the rotary drum is journalled and is meshed with the transmission gear in the drive mechanism to actuate the starter switch. The starter switch is adapted to close a contact for a short time. Simultaneously, the gear loosely fitted on the rotary shaft and having the projection is rotated by a predetermined angle by one motion for pulling the grip. Further, when the grip is pulled, the gear mounted on the rotary shaft is rotated by one revolution so that the engaging projection is engaged with the rotary lever which is therefore rotated to close a main switch, thereby driving the drive mechanism continuously. To achieve the above and other objects, the present invention also provides a starter device for a toy drive mechanism that simulates manual starting of a small engine.

    "abstract": "The present invention is an electronic card and board game for playing card and chance games, such as bingo, keno, and the like. The game is being played by at least two participants, namely, the game operator, such as the caller in the bingo game, and at least one individual player. In the process of the game, the game operator utilizes the master electronic game board, and the individual player utilizes the player&#39;s electronic game board. In the preferred embodiment, the design of the master board is identical to the design of the player&#39;s board, but a broad variety of different designs of the master game board and the player&#39;s game board can be implemented. Both the master game board and the player&#39;s game board are controlled by embedded microprocessors and are equipped with keyboards and graphics displays. Upon the game operator&#39;s command entered via the keyboard, the master game board generates and radio broadcasts encoded discretionary and random data relevant to the game, such as bingo pattern and random bingo numbers. This data is received, decoded, and processed by the player&#39;s game board. Specifically, the received random data is compared with the numerical contents of at least one game card, such as a bingo card, residing in the memory of the microprocessor controlling the player&#39;s game board. Matches discovered as a result of this comparison are signalled to the player. The current pattern of matches is compared with the required game pattern transmitted by the master game board. The winning combination of matches is being signaled visually and audibly. The game card being used by the player is implemented as a replaceable, removable, transparent template overlaying the display and bearing imprinted game symbols, such as bingo numbers. The microprocessor signals the discovered matches by activation, e.g. darkening, the areas of the display located immediately beneth the respective symbols on the card. As a result, a visual image of a marked game card is created. The contents of the game card are computed by the microprocessor on the basis of the identification number of the game card in accordance with a predetermined algorithm. The default identification number is being prestored in the memory of the microprocessor, and, upon replacement of the game card, the player can update the identification number of the card by simple keyboard entries. The primary objective of the invention is to provide an electronic card and board game which relieves the player from the tedious and error-prone operation of manual marking matches on the game card. In particular, it is the objective of the invention to provide a completely automated bingo game in which the player does not have even to touch or watch the game card or the game board at any time during successive rounds of the game, whereas the caller has only to push a single button to control the game. It is the further objective of the invention to provide a design of the game board which facilitates a broad and easy selection of the game cards and games being played with the help of the same game board. An additional objective of the invention is to preclude unauthorized or untimely change of the game card by the player. Other objectives and features will become apparent from the following specification.",

    "abstract": "The invention concerns a method for the mechanical production of pieces of the same length of fish conveyed transverse to their longitudinal axis as well as an apparatus for carrying out such a method, this apparatus comprising a trough conveyor which conveys the fish transverse to their longitudinal axis and at least one cutting means which overlaps at least the cross-sectional area of fish placed in the conveying troughs, the apparatus further comprising a displacing device for displacing fish tail first and an abutting device for limiting the displacement of the fish by catching the same by their tail roots. 2. Description of Prior Art Such fish pieces which are preferably produced from sardines, herrings, anchovies etc. are needed essentially as a filler for tins. They are offered to the consumer prepared in different ways. The tail pieces are usually preferred since especially in single reciprocal layers of such pieces a more profitable rate of feeding and a product which is more pleasing to the eye are achieved. Problems arise in trying to fulfil the quality demands in this respect as well as with regard to the weight tolerance, which problems are mainly due to the fact that the fish to be processed are of different lengths and maturity. The usual practice of putting a uniform number of pieces--for example four--into tins, requires a pre-sorting into several classes of small size and thickness tolerance due to differences in size and thickness. The device for cutting the pieces thus has to be adjustable to each necessary piece length. This is extremely difficult to achieve with the machines known so far so that these machines and the methods practised therewith are not satisfactory. A piece cutting device is known (e.g. U.S. Pat. No. 2,431,465) in which the fish are conveyed in the troughs of a trough conveyor transverse to their longitudinal axis. The upwardly extending walls of the troughs are provided with slots extending to under their bottom surface, at least one circular knife arranged above the trough conveyor entering into them. In order to sufficiently support the fish the slots lie at such a distance from each other that leftovers of the peripheries remain between the slots. Apart from the fact that only pieces of the same length--regarding the plane of decapitating--can be manufactured, the tail piece being the remnant, the shifting of the knife in order to achieve a different length for the pieces is very complicated and only possible in relatively rough gradation. There is further known (DE-PS No. 717 592) a device for the production of so-called &#34;fork-size bites&#34; whereby the fish not yet decapitated are inserted, after their tail fin has been removed, with their head facing the centre into a circular conveyor with partitions consisting of ridges running above a circular table. The circular table has openings. After being aligned with their snouts in the same position by means of a guide the fish fall through the openings into a set of pairs of disc knives which shear with each other and carry out the transverse severing. The disadvantages laid down in connection with the first-mentioned cutting device are also found here. However, a more delicate adjustment of the desired piece lengths is possible. Furthermore, a piece cutting or slicing device is known (DE-PS No. 26 44 024) in which the head end of the fish forms the remnant piece. The fish rumps lying in the receiving troughs are, for this purpose, pushed in the direction of their tail end under a measuring bar which forms an abutment supporting itself on the flank of the fish. Thus positioned, the fish rumps are led to a fixed circular knife which cuts off tail pieces of almost the same weight but differing lengths. Such fish pieces facilitate the compilation of a certain filler weight but make a reasonable positioning in the tins impossible. 3. Object of the Invention It is therefore an essential object of the present invention to show a way of manufacturing fish tail pieces of the same length which makes a continuous adjustment of the lengths of these pieces in a simple manner possible. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This object is solved according to the invention by a method in which the fish are conveyed transverse to their longitudinal axis and which comprises the steps of aligning the fish according to the position of their tail root, displacing the fish by a pulling engagement or gripping in the region of their tail fins, ending the displacement of the fish by interrupting the pulling engagement and separating the tail piece by means of a cut led transverse through the fish rump. The ending of the displacement of the fish resulting from the pulling engagement, i.e. its positioning for the separating cut which follows can occur by cutting off the tail fin or interrupting the pulling grip in the region of the tail fin according to whether the fish pieces are desired with or without their tail fins. Preferably a holding device for gripping the fish in the region of its tail is provided next to a tail side end of the conveying troughs in an apparatus as described in the introductory paragraph to carry out the method according to the invention, which holding device carries out an accompanying movement which is almost synchronous with the conveying speed of the trough conveyor and which diverges in respect of the conveying direction of the trough conveyor and is adjustable in connection with the position of its engagement resp. its release. The advantages achieved with the invention lie especially in that the length of the pieces can be adjusted precisely and easily in order to achieve an optimal degree of filling of the tins as well as an aesthetically pleasing filling. A functionally safe embodiment which is also simple to manufacture comprises a holding device including pincers which run in the plane of the bottom surfaces of the conveying troughs in a circular path and are adjustable with regard to their position of operation, i.e. their opening or closing places, which pincers are arranged in a partition which corresponds to the partition of the conveying troughs in the conveyor. In order to produce pieces of fish without tail fin the apparatus according to the invention can have a device for separating the tail fin, which device comprises a circular knife tangentially touching the circular path of the pincers. It is advantageous to provide the circular knife to be adjustable with regard to its angle to the conveying direction of the trough conveyor in order to be able to set, in a simple manner, the amount of displacement of the fish in the conveying troughs, i.e. the length of the fish pieces to be produced from the transverse cut which follows. In order to further reduce construction costs the pincers can each comprise a moveable leg which can be held pressed under the force of a spring against a circular disc which carries the pincers resp. their legs. For the sake of ensuring a safe grip the surface of the circular disc facing the legs of the pincers may comprise a well gripping and/or elastic covering, i.e. a top covering which guarantees a reliable conveying.",

    "abstract": "The invention comprises novel compositions of fatty acids, ester, or oils which include potassium incorporated therein. These composition are made by heating the oil component to a temperature of at least above 230° C. for a sufficient time to incorporate a predetermined amount of potassium into the oil. At least about 0.1% can be used, although between 1 and 10% is preferred. These compositions of the invention may be administered to a patient who has cells or tissue which are deficient in potassium to increase the potassium content as well as to treat the symptoms of diseases or adverse effects caused by the potassium deficient cells or tissue. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION I have found that in general, the abnormal cells and tissues in the body have free lipids. Thus, a lipid or compound having a lipidic character introduced into the body can be selectively taken by the abnormal cells. Accordingly, it is believed that a potassium compound having lipidic properties is useful as a therapeutic agent for patients who have such abnormal cells. I have found that potassium can be incorporated in the molecule of a fatty acid by heating together an organic or inorganic salt of potassium with a fatty acid or its oil. Preferably, the fatty acid or oil is previously oxidized by being heated and mixed with air or oxygen. The mixtures of potassium and fatty acids or oil are heated at a temperature above about 230° C. for a time until an exothermic reaction is observed, which reaction indicates that the incorporation is taking place. Examples of the potassium/fatty acid or oil compositions that can be used according to the invention include the reaction products of allylic unsaturated fatty acids or esters and a potassium salt. These reaction products are produced by heating a liquid composition containing a fatty acid or fatty ester, structurally characterized by allylic unsaturation with a potassium salt. Applicant believes that any potassium salt may be used in this invention. Preferably, the potassium salt is an organic potassium salt such as potassium acetate or potassium carbonate, and the liquid is preferably oxidized for example, by bubbling air or oxygen through the reaction mixture. The allylically unsaturated compound is preferably a naturally occurring oil containing polyunsaturated fatty esters, such as an animal, vegetable, or fish oil, and, particularly, polyunsaturated vegetable oils. Sesame oil, a vegetable oil consisting largely of triglycerides, is the most advantageous composition found to date in the practice of this invention. The composition utilized should contain a significant percentage of molecular species having allylic moieties to render the compositions useful according to the invention. Such moieties are indicated by the following partial structures --CH═CH--CH 2  --CH═CH-- and/or --CH═CH--CH═CH--CH 2  --. As indicated, the unsaturation can be conjugated or nonconjugated, but the composition must contain allylic methylene hydrogen. Such compositions may initially be oxidized or heated in the presence of air or oxygen at the temperature range between about 100° C. and about 150° C. The oxygen can be obtained by merely heating the composition in a vessel which is open to the atmosphere, but preferably and advantageously, the source of oxygen is a gas such as air which is injected into the heated oil. Introduction of air also provides a source of agitation. The heating step is conducted for a period of from about 15 minutes to about two hours. The temperature should be maintained at an upper limit within the range of about 230° C. to 250° C., and preferably about 235° C. to 240° C. These temperature limitations are based on a heating time of about one-half hour. The temperatures can be altered within limits depending on the time of heating. For example, when the temperature is about 235° C., the time is about one-half hour, while temperatures as high as 250° C. require a shorter period of time for heating. Higher temperatures for a prolonged period of time tend to degrade the composition and should thus be avoided. Agitation, by stirring for example, aids in the reaction, and experiments to date indicate that a fairly violent stirring is advantageous. The introduction of air into the mixture during the heating is also very advantageous, particularly when the mixture is not subjected to prolonged heating and thus, is the preferred method. The mixing or stirring can be accomplished with the introduction of the air. After the reaction has taken place, the mixture is cooled. The remaining fluid is ready for use after appropriate sterilization for injection or incorporated into capsules, such as gelatin, for oral administration. The precise nature of the compositions which result from the above-described treatment or the identity of the effective component or components is not presently known. It is known, however, that these compositions do include potassium and that a proportion of potassium in the range of about 1 to 10 weight percent has been found to be effective. As mentioned above, although any potassium salt may be used, an organic salt of potassium, such as potassium carbonate or potassium acetate, is preferred, with the potassium bonding the eleostearic acid present in this oil. Although any amount above 0.1% of potassium incorporated into the composition is useful, the preferred amount ranges between about 1 to 10 weight percent. The products obtained have the potassium incorporated in general at the level of the double bonds of the different unsaturated fatty acids, this causes their toxicity to be exceptionally low. The injection of 1 ml of a product having 5% potassium to a mouse does not kill it. The incorporated potassium composition may be administered orally, by injections, sublingually or rectally in the appropriate formulation. The incorporated potassium is believed to be absorbed by the abnormal cells, thus compensating for their low potassium content. This treatment produces objective and subjective improvement in the conditions, of patients having a variety of diseases based upon such abnormal cells. The neoplastic diseases are examples of diseased in which low cellular potassium abnormal cells are found.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to a hand-held controllable power assister device as applied to syringes adopted to deliver a liquid into a patient. More particularly, the invention relates to a held-held controllable power injection device for delivering, by injection, x-ray contrast media into a patient prior to or during urographic or angiographic procedures. 2. Reported Developments Urography is a radiological technique wherein at least a part of the urinary tract of a mammal is rendered opaque by intravenous injection of a contrast medium or by injection into the bladder through the urethra. Angiography is also a radiological technique wherein the arteries or veins of a mammal are outlined by injecting a radiographic medium. In both techniques the coated vascular structures are radiographically imaged for diagnostic purposes. For delivery to the desired site, the contrast medium is placed in an appropriate syringe and forced through a hollow needle or a catheter in such a manner that the contrast medium enters the blood stream or the bladder at the appropriate time and place for taking radiographic images. As contrast medium is being injected to the site to be visualized through the hollow needle or a catheter, high pressures are often encountered, sometimes as high as 1,000 psi. This requires a rather high force to be exerted on the piston in order to deliver the content of the syringe. Furthermore, such force is to be exerted in a constant manner for continuous and even volume delivery of the contrast medium. Early injection systems were designed for manual injection of the contrast medium by means of a hand-held glass syringe. A mechanical injection system activated by a foot switch has also been, and is still being used for most general radiographic procedures. However, this system was only rarely used for coronary angiography for the probable reason that operator control is greatly reduced and the risk of coronary artery dissection increased. Power injectors in general have certain advantages over hand-operated injectors including the following. They reduce reliance on an assistant enabling the operator to be in complete control of the injection of the contrast medium, they can deliver a precise volume, and the pressure generated can be limited by presetting a pressure limit. Power injectors are of three types: hydraulic, pneumatic and electric. Hydraulic injectors have an electric motor connected to a hydraulic pump, which drives a ram connected to a syringe that contains the contrast medium. In pneumatic injectors, the source of power is compressed gas supplied by a tank or compressor. Electric injectors are powered by electric motors in which a transmission means serves to change circular motion into linear motion which then drives a ram. While typical power injectors eliminate the physical effort required with manual injectors, they are not easy to use, are expensive and the perception of instantaneous control present with manual injectors is lost because the syringe and controls for the injectors are not hand-held or not conveniently handleable during the injection process. For example, a gas power-assister hand-held syringe does eliminate the physical effort associated with manual injection and also provides a perceived instantaneous control of the injection, however, it requires a gas system to power the syringe, such as pressurized carbon dioxide gas. The gas delivery system includes a carbon dioxide gas tank with various indicators and controls, which reduces the portability of the device, it requires valuable space in the proximity of the injection, it adds to the complexity of using the device for the intended purpose and requires periodic replacement of the gas tank. Battery powdered injectors are also available for use in angiography and urography employing a syringe for holding a contrast medium and a plunger connected to a mechanical means to automatically deliver the contrast medium. Some of these injectors include microprocessor technology for programming rates and time delivery and have visual or audio display for ease of controlling the injection process. As these injectors become more sophisticated, the cost of making and using them increases as well as the complexity of use tends to increase the opportunities for breakdown. The present invention is directed to a hand-held, light-weight power assister which eliminates the physical effort required with manual injectors but otherwise allows the practitioner complete human control of the injection process. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The power assister device of the present invention is designed to be hand-held by one hand, light weight, inexpensive and to allow complete control over the process of delivering radiopaque media to the patient by the medical practitioner. To that end, its configuration resembles a pistol the handle portion of which provides for firm hold. Activating switch, having on-off-- and neutral positions, is located in the handle portion to be controlled by the index finger of the practitioner. While the device does not incorporate complicated and expensive electronic components which tend to break down and are cumbersome to use, it provides electrical energy to deliver the contrast media to the patient at a constant rate of delivery and it incorporates limit switches to automatically stop the electric motor when the lead screw, which engages the piston, is in its initial or completely extended position. In accordance with the invention, the hand-held power assister device comprises: a pistol-shaped casing;",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a controllable liquid crystal matrix (patternable) mask for controlling ultraviolet laser energy, and a system which involves the use of the controllable liquid crystal matrix mask for use in, for example, an ophthalmic surgical system such as an excimer laser system for contouring the cornea through controlled ablation of the cornea with penetration into the stroma and volumetric removal of corneal tissue whereby the ablated corneal surface is characterized by a sculptured new curvature having improved optical properties. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Various surgical techniques for reprofiling of the corneal surface have been proposed as described in, for example, L&#39;Esperance, U.S. Pat. No. 4,732,14; J. T. Lin, U.S. Pat. No. 5,520,679; David F Muller, U.S. Pat. No. 4,856,513; Kristian Hohla, U.S. Pat. No. 5,520,679. Each of these patents is incorporated by reference herein. In practice there are two basic techniques to ablate and remove a set volume of tissue in the cornea and they are: 1) a scanning technique that uses a small flying laser spot between 1-2 mm in diameter and requires thousands of pulses to do the surgery; and 2), a large spot beam technique wherein a laser beam of around 8 mm in cross-section is used in conjunction with an erodible mask or a moving, blocking mask to ablate and which generally requires, on average, a few hundred pulses to achieve the desired ablation. The main advantage of a flying laser spot technique is the ability to readily execute irregular patterns. However, the flying laser spot technique suffers from the drawback of generally requiring longer surgical times to execute the desired ablation pattern both from the standpoint of the number of pulses required and the overlapping requirement to ensure coverage of the ablated area. Any increase in the length of time required to carry out the laser ablation process can lead to longer corneal exposure time and corresponding medical concerns such as cornea dehydration which can lead to poorer healing, poorer visual acuity and, in general, longer post operative recovery times. A longer time period in which a laser is operated per patient also leads to a decrease in the useful life of the laser and an increase in service requirements. In addition to the time delay associated with a flying spot laser technique, there is also the problem of ridges and valleys being formed due to overlapping that will prevent a highly smooth and polished ablation. Flying laser spot techniques place greater stress on the laser cavity and the optical train components due to high repetition and rate requirements. A large beam spot system does allow for more rapid application of the desired energy (including the avoidance of the degree of overlapping involved in a randomly or non-randomly applied, partially overlapping flying spot system) and typically places less strain on the laser equipment, but does not have the irregular pattern versatility provided with a flying spot system. Also, if mechanically moving components are relied upon as the means for blocking or allowing through the laser beam (e.g., an iris or rotating or sliding aperture plate), then the problems of mechanical wear, potential jamming or breakdown arise. Attempts have been made to provide masks that operate with a large beam application including EP 0 417 952 to Rose et al. which uses a stacked set of binarily weighted masks (A to H) on a cornea intended for sculpturing. A proposed system such as this one suffers from a variety of drawbacks such as the time consumption involved in stacking and developing the mask sets and the increased potential for error brought about by a system using so many different stacked mask components. Another example of the use of large beam application is found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,994,058 which describes a supported or contact type mask presenting a predetermined resistance to the beam such as through use of a different height erodible mask or by varying the composition of the plastic material making up the mask. A mask arrangement such as this avoids the complications of a scanning laser, but is very limited from the standpoint of having to prepare a new mask for each patient and, with respect to an erodible mask, not having the benefit of being able to test the pattern on a test strip or the like without destroying the mask. In use of an erodible mask there is also heavy reliance on chosen material consistency. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed at providing a controllable, patternable liquid crystal mask that is particularly well suited for use with ultraviolet electromagnetic energy utilized in an ophthamological surgical procedure such as a photo refractive keratectomy (PRK); photo therapeutic karatectomy (PTK); and a laser in-situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgical procedure for resculpturing the exposed cornea of an eye. Accordingly, the present invention is directed at providing a controllable patternable mask system, an ophthalmic laser surgery system with said controllable mask system, and a method of using the same. The apparatus and method of the present invention is particularly well suited for ablating a corneal surface using a laser in the ultraviolet spectrum to achieve extremely smooth and precise ablation surfaces with a mask system that can be repeatedly used for different patient ablation requirements. The mask is used with a large beam spot (e.g., 6-8 mm) which covers the entire projected surface on a cornea and thus avoids the time delays associated with a flying spot beam as well as ridge and valley formation. In addition to multi-patient use, the present invention avoids the delays associated with the prior art with respect to forming or assembling the mask. Moreover, the present invention provides a system which can achieve repeated high precision or registration between the planned or predetermined ablation volume to be removed and the actual ablation volume removed so as to better enable a surgeon to achieve desired levels of eyesight corrections. Also, the volumetric ablation patterns to be removed can involve highly irregular or regular configurations, as an object of the present invention is to provide a system which facilitates the execution of a surgical procedure on highly irregular individual customized patterns on a patient&#39;s cornea in addition to more regular volumetric patterns. Furthermore, the arrangement of the present invention provides a system that can achieve a customized volumetric ablation pattern based on, for example, a stored, ophthamological patient data set (e.g., an ablation data set as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 09/267,926 filed Mar. 10, 1999 by Dr. Luis Ruiz which application is incorporated herein) which data set is developed by a measuring instrument such as a topographer or aberrometer and, under the present invention, is provided to a processor for input to the mask system via a digital interface, for example. The matrix mask system of the present invention includes an active liquid crystal matrix mask which receives expanded, polarized laser energy and, based on the processed patient data, controls the energy pattern that exits in the mask for sculpturing the desired ablation pattern on the cornea. Under the present invention, the ablation pattern data set is processed by a processor such as the laser&#39;s main computer which communicates with the mask via an interface or the like to provide corresponding commands to activate the matrix mask. For example, in one embodiment of the invention, the transmission pixel pattern of the mask is individually controlled by the computer and is synchronized with the pulse rate of the main excimer laser. In this way, any regular or irregular ablation volume can be removed by ablating with each pulse of the large beam a set depth (based to the laser characteristics such as laser energy and density) corresponding with the matrix pattern set for that pulse. By changing the mask&#39;s matrix pixel pattern with each large beam pulse a different ablation configuration (or the same) can be removed to achieve the desired total pattern, volume and depth. With an excimer laser working in the ultraviolet energy spectrum, the components of the optical train are subjected to relatively high energy flux levels. Under the present invention, the large beam is preferably expanded with a beam expander or the like positioned upstream from the active matrix mask to lower the energy density per area received by the pixels of the mask. This will avoid premature destruction of the mask. The non-blocked, transmitted portions of the large beam containing the latent image determined by the active mask are then compressed with a focusing lens or the like to achieve the desired ablation profile. Prior to reaching the liquid crystal material of the liquid crystal active mask, the laser beam is first polarized with a polarizer and, after exiting the liquid crystal material, the beam with the latent image passes through a second polarizer also known as an analyzer to the ablation plane or surface. The position of the expander/collimator can be either before or after the first polarizer, with the same being true for the relationship between the focusing lens and second polarizer. Thus, the present invention preferably features a controlled ablation of the cornea, using ultraviolet laser radiation to achieve a sculpturing action derived from a computer driving a digital programmable distribution of excimer flux density across an ultraviolet computer controllable liquid crystal matrix mask as to achieve a desired volume and shape of the ablation for the correction of the curvature of the cornea. The computer controllable liquid crystal matrix mask is based on a matrix array (matrix is used in a broad sense to involve any pattern suited for forming a desired ablation pattern on the ablation plane or surface) of individual optical liquid crystal pixel cells with optical states between fully transparent to fully opaque or mirror like to the UV light. (Preferably, for high resolution purposes, each cell is individually controlled although groups of interlinked pixels could be controlled by the processor as a group unit to present a combined transmission state. Hence, the term “pixel” or “pixel cells” is used herein unless otherwise indicated to include single or groups of similarly controlled pixel element groups.) As noted, the ultraviolet computer controllable liquid crystal matrix mask is based on transmission of polarized light through the mask device, the transmission of polarized light through each individual pixel is preferably controlled by an electrical voltage and a time duty cycle. In one embodiment of the invention the voltage is switched or adjusted to have the pixels either in a fully transparent or fully blocking mode with the pixel switching timing being synchronized with the laser pulse rate. In addition thereto, the frequency duty cycle per pixel can be adjusted or varied with relation to the laser pulse cycle of the main laser to achieve multiple on and off states of transmission during the main laser pulse cycle so as to control the maximum state of ablation during that main pulse cycle. Preferably the active matrix liquid crystal mask is based on the twisted nematic (TN) natural physical effect of liquid crystals for controlling light transmission. The principle of the active matrix mask device of the present invention is as follows: Unpolarized excimer light enters a first polarizer and emerges polarized, the polarized light (UV electromagnetic radiation) is sent into the liquid crystal mask which comprises many pixels. When no voltage is applied to a pixel, the polarization vector of the incoming light is rotated a quarter turn/90° by the liquid crystal molecules through the TN natural physical effect. A second polarizer (or analyzer) placed at the output side of the liquid crystal cell is used to transmit either the light (normally on) or reject the light (normally off). When a proper voltage is applied to the electrodes of the pixel, the TN effect disappears (as the liquid crystals tend to orient with the electric field resulting in a loss of their natural twisting function) and the polarization vector of the polarized light is unchanged. The light will therefore be rejected (off) or transmitted (on) by the second output polarizer, depending on whether the device is normally on or off, respectively.",

Typically, a large cylindrical aerosol can contains a volume of the liquid cosmetic product that is the equivalent to many applications of the product. These known aerosol cans are large in that although the can is able to fit into a medicine cabinet or similar location in a person&#39;s washroom, the can is not easily concealed in a clothing pocket or in a person&#39;s hand.

    "abstract": "This invention relates to the field of radiography, and more particularly to a fourth generation Computed Tomography (CT) Scanner having an optimized scanner geometry. 2. Description of the Prior Art Computed tomography processes are a modern technique developed to provide a non-invasive means for revealing internal organs and tissues of a human body in cross-section for the purpose of diagnosing the condition of the particular cross-section of the body being examined. Basically, computed tomographic techniques utilize a series of x-ray projections or views made from different angles, which are taken axially through a &#34;slice&#34; or thin cross-sectional area of a patient. The X-rays generated by a radiographic source, or in some instances Gamma Rays from a radioactive source, are transmitted transversely through a section of the patient&#39;s anatomy and are detected by a high-efficiency radiation detectors. Each projection or view of the cross-sectional &#34;slice&#34; consists of a series of ray paths or samples through the section with differences in the ray samples arising from attenuation differences in the slice or differences in path length through the slice. The different angular projections of the subject with each angular projection, comprised of a series of discrete ray samples provides the input by which x-ray or gamma ray attenuation coefficients can be calculated in a computer and the image of the cross-section of the patient&#39;s anatomical variations reconstructed. Thus, a computed tomography scanner obtains, by mathematical reconstruction, a transverse sectional image from transmitted radiation projection data, as is well known. In the past several years, advances in computed tomography techniques have resulted in several generations of scanners. In the first scanner commercially marketed, the series of ray samples comprising a given projection was obtained by a translational movement of the x-ray source and a detector. The source and detector were stopped and rotated and the sequence repeated to obtain the different angular projections. In a 2nd generation scanner the data gathering process is much the same except several detectors were employed allowing for greater angular increments per rotation and fewer rotations resulting in shorter scan times. In 3rd generation geometries the x-ray source and detector array pivot around a common point in a single rotational movement and the x-ray beam sequentially pulsed giving rise to the different angular projections; while in 4th generation geometries, the different projections of the slice arise from the ring of stationary detectors placed around the slice with each detector taking sequential samples as the x-ray source rotates around the slice giving rise to a different angular projection. Compared to the 1st generation scanner, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation geometries detect a greater portion of the X-rays produced allowing for shorter scan times. The ease of the pure and continuous rotational movement upon the initiation of a scan of the 3rd and 4th generation machines compared to the start/stop motions associated with the earlier designs results in their being the current geometries marketed by most manufacturers. In 3rd generation geometries the distance between samples in a projection is the detector-to-detector spacing which is coarse and limits the scanner&#39;s spatial resolution. In 1st, 2nd and 4th generation geometries the projections can be finely sampled and the basic limitation is the size of the detector aperture. Other factors which may limit the spatial resolution of a CT scanner are the cutoff frequency, f c , of the reconstruction algorithm or the Nyquist frequency, f p , of the image display consisting of square pixels of finite size. The algorithm cutoff frequency f c  is usually (but not always) matched to the fundamental limitation of the scanner which is dictated by the smallest value of either the sampling Nyquist frequency (f s ), the pixel display Nyquist frequency (f p ), or the detector aperture cutoff frequency (f a ). Currently, detector apertures in 4th generation geometries are approximately four mm and anatomical detail much smaller than this is therefore not sharply defined. While the detector apertures can be stopped down, or made smaller to improve the scanner&#39;s resolution, when this is done a larger percentage of the X-rays emerging from the patient strike dead space between the detectors and are wasted, thereby reducing the x-ray dose efficiency discussed in more detail hereinafter. Obviously, those X-rays which strike detector dead space contribute no information to the resultant image, and their loss results in increased radiation dose to the patient. At present, the major component of a CT Scanner&#39;s manufacturing cost is associated with the detectors, detector electronics, and computer processing system which in turn is dependent upon the number of detectors employed. Thus, when detector size is reduced to improve resolution and system performance, a greater number of detectors is required and the cost of the overall CT system is concomitantly increased such that a clear tradeoff between cost and resolution is evidenced by the present state of the art. In order to stay within reasonable commercial constraints, current 3rd and 4th generation scanners typically have between 500 and 1,200 detectors. The concept of prepatient collimation to confine the x-ray beam to the region of interest to reduce the deleterious effects of large beams of radiation has been widely used in the medical x-ray industry since the turn of the century. It is currently employed in CT scanners to define the slice thickness and detector assemblies. Additional prepatient collimation designed to reduce the percentage of radiation striking the dead spaces between detectors has been introduced for 2nd generation geometries and marketed by EMI and Elscint. However, due to the geometrical unsharpness of the collimator at the detectors resulting from the finite size of the focal spot, such collimation schemes do not result in geometrical efficiencies of much greater than 65%. Ohio Nuclear also announced a 4th generation CT scanner, the 2020 Δ-Scanner, which employed prepatient collimation. Their design consisted of a stationary ring of 720 4 mm detectors separated by 4 mm of dead spaces and the objective was to eliminate radiation from striking the 4 mm dead spaces. However, this design was dropped due to the finite size of the focal spot and the x-ray optics of the geometry making it impossible to confine the x-ray beam with prepatient collimation to the 4 mm detectors without a significant amount of radiation striking the dead spaces and also resulting in a significant loss in the x-ray flux striking the detectors. Another prior art CT Scanner, the 7000 series by EMI Ltd., a variant 4th generation geometry consisting of a Nutating® rather than stationary array of 1,112 batch produced solid state detectors arranged as a small ring that wobbles as the x-ray source rotates around the patient, in which the detectors at 180° from the x-ray source are translated in the opposite direction allowing the x-ray beam to strike the former. The circle defined by the rotation of the x-ray source is larger than that of the detector ring. Advantageously, the EMI 7000 CT Scanner enjoys improved system resolution as a result of the smaller detectors employed, and also reduced dead space due to close packing of the detectors. The motivation for the design lies in the fact that fewer detectors are required than would be in the larger ring diameter of a conventional 4th generation design to achieve the same resolution. Nevertheless, while the EMI 7000 CT Scanner realizes improved system performance, the improvement is achieved at high cost due to the complicated mechanics of the Nutating® detector ring implementation. Furthermore, since the EMI 7000 Series approach employs a small detector ring, further advances in system performance are very much limited to detector technology, and more specifically, detector aperture size. Then, even if additional smaller detectors are used, the above-described tradeoff must nevertheless play the dominant role in arriving at a final system design. Yet another CT Scanner under consideration by Pfizer involves the possibility of employing a conventional 4th generation design consisting of a stationary detector array comprised of a large number, as many as 2,400, small detectors essentially equivalent at least in their size and x-ray detection efficiency to those currently being used in the EMI 7000 Scanner. Once again, however, arbitrary increase in the number of detectors significantly complicates the detector electronics and related computer processing system, greatly increasing the cost of the total system. Examples of additional prior art CT Scanners are found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,123,659 to Oliver, 4,101,768 to Lill, 4,097,747 to Kowalski, 4,097,744 to LeMay, 4,096,391 to Barnes, 4,096,389 to Ashe, 4,091,289 to LeMay, 4,075,491 to Boyd, 4,066,901 to Seppi, 4,048,505 to Hounsfield, 4,031,395 to LeMay, and 3,684,886 to Muehllegner. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is one object of this invention to provide a novel Computer Tomography (CT) Scanner exhibiting improved contrast sensitivity and spatial resolution. Another object of this invention is to provide a novel CT Scanner in which x-ray dose efficiency to the patient is maximized. Yet another object of this invention is to provide a novel CT Scanner capable of producing high resolution diagnostic data with a minimum of detectors and data acquisition electronics. These and other objects are achieved according to the invention by providing a new and improved CT Scanner including a series of stationary detector groups symmetrically arranged around a detector ring. Typically, depending upon the system requirements, the scanner has 25 to 99 groups of detectors with each detector group consisting of 10 to 60 detectors. The size of each detector aperture is typically 2 mm or less. In order to eliminate unnecessary patient exposure to x-ray radiation, a prepatient x-ray collimator is disposed between the x-ray source and the patient to eliminate patient exposure to X-rays in sectors between detector groups. During a scan, in one embodiment, the collimator synchronously rotates around the x-ray tube focal spot such that the collimator apertures maintain alignment with the detector groups. In another embodiment the collimator synchronously rotates around the center of the patient circle to achieve the requisite prepatient x-ray collimation. In either embodiment while the x-ray tube rotates clockwise about the center of the detector ring through an angle θ, the collimator moves counter-clockwise through a corresponding angle φ relative to the focal spot where the movement of the x-ray focal spot and the collimator is governed by the transcendental equation",

    "abstract": "In some examples, the IMD  102  is adapted to store patient data and use the data to provide tailored therapy. For example, using historical physiological data, an IMD  102  may be able to discriminate between lethal and non-lethal heart rhythms and deliver an appropriate therapy. However, it is often desirable to establish a proper baseline of historical data by collecting a sufficient amount of data in the IMD  102 . In some examples, a “learning period” of some time (e.g., thirty days) is used to establish the baseline for one or more physiological signals. An IMD  102  may, in an example, store a moving window of data of operation, such as a time period equal to the learning period, and use the information as a baseline indication of the patient&#39;s biorhythms or biological events. When an IMD  102  malfunctions or reaches the end of its lifecycle, a new IMD (not shown) may be implanted in place of the retired IMD  102 . In some examples, the replacement IMD is a newer or different model than the unit being replaced. In other examples, the replacement IMD is substantially the same as the explanted IMD. The replacement IMD, however, generally does not have the benefit of the historical patient data, and thus, the patient  100  must endure another learning period as the new IMD builds its baseline. In addition, any patient-specific device settings stored on the explanted IMD  102  are typically not automatically transferred to the replacement device. The current inventor has recognized that providing historical patient data to a replacement IMD advantageously bypasses any necessary learning period. Additionally, the current inventor has recognized that automatically transferring device settings to a replacement IMD may be more efficient and less prone to human error. FIG. 2  is a dataflow diagram illustrating portions of a system capable of automatic data transfer. A first patient device  200  is capable of sensing a patient&#39;s physiological data and storing such data. In an example, the first patient device  200  includes an IMD, such as one illustrated in  FIG. 1  at  102 . In other examples, the first patient device  200  may be an external patient monitoring device, such as an electrocardiograph machine, Holter monitor, blood pressure cuff, pulse oximeter, posture sensor, accelerometer, EEG monitor or respiration monitor. Data  202  stored on the first patient device  200  is transferred to the external transfer device  204 . In some examples, the data transfer is enabled by wireless communication, such as inductive telemetry or radio frequency telemetry. In another example, the data transfer is performed over a wired communication link, such as a serial connection. Data  202  may include stored physiological data, calculated summary data, event data or device data. For example, an implantable medical device may sense and collect raw physiological data, temporarily store the physiological data, use the data to calculate summary data, such as trend data, and store the trend data while discarding the temporarily stored raw physiological data. By only storing summary data, such as trend data, a more efficient use of the device&#39;s internal memory may be achieved. As another example, when an implanted medical device senses an event, such as a tachyarrhythmia episode, the IMD may store event markers or other details about the event (e.g., time of event, severity, length of event). Historical event data can be used for predictively determining similar future events and adapting treatment accordingly. In an example, the external transfer device  204  can temporarily store the data  202  and process the stored data  202 . For example, if the first patient device  200  is an IMD that is being explanted to be replaced with another IMD  206 , the external transfer device  204  may condition the data  202  to be compatible with the replacement IMD  206 . The conditioning may, in some examples, not involve any data transformation, such as when the first patient device  200  and the IMD  206  are substantially the same device. In other examples, the data conditioning may involve complex de-filtering and re-filtering of data, such as when the replacement IMD  206  is a different model or has different capabilities than the first patient device  200 . In another example, the conditioning may only partially transform the data, such as to an un-processed or raw, sensed form, and provide the data to the target device (e.g., the replacement IMD  206 ), which can treat it as sensed data and perform its own signal processing. In addition, data conditioning may involve a translation of device settings, such as from one device model to another model with more or fewer settings, or with settings that may be a combination or subcombination of the other device&#39;s settings. As another example, the external transfer device  204  may also provide data  202 , either processed or unprocessed, to another destination, such as a research laboratory  208  or a centralized patient management system  210 . Users at a research laboratory  208  may be interested in the data  202  for several reasons including offline analysis or simulation. In addition, providing data  202  to a centralized patient management system  210  may allow for other health care practitioners to access the data for research, statistical population use, patient monitoring, or for data recovery purposes. In other examples, the external transfer device  204  may also provide data  202 , either processed or unprocessed, to an external patient monitor (not shown) or a data storage device (not shown). FIG. 3  is a flowchart illustrating a method  300  for transferring data. At  302 , one or more target devices are determined. Examples of target devices may include an external patient monitor, an implantable medical device, or a data storage device (e.g., a database associated with a research laboratory or a centralized patient management system). At  304 , the method  300  determines if the target device is the substantially the same as the source device. For example, if a source device, such as an IMD, malfunctions or is defective, a same or similar device may be used to replace the defective unit. The replacement device may have many, if not all, of the same signal processing or other capabilities and features. As such, no data transformation is needed and at  306 , the data can be transferred to the target device with little or no data processing. However, if the target device is different, such as may be the case when an IMD is upgraded or if the data is transmitted to an external system for other uses, depending on the data transmitted, certain processing may be needed to transform the data into a form compatible with the target device. At  308 , the data is processed. In an example, at  308  the data is processed to a format compatible with the target device before being transferred (block  306 ). In another example, the data is processed to a substantially unprocessed (e.g., sensed) format at  308 . Then the substantially unprocessed data is transferred to the target device (block  306 ) where the data is processed by the target device, such that it is substantially similar to the target device&#39;s native format. At  310 , the method  300  determines if the data is to be transferred to another device. If so, then the method  300  proceeds to decision block  304  to continue processing. FIG. 4  is a flowchart illustrating a method  308  for processing data for transfer to a target device. At  400 , the method  308  accesses a source device&#39;s device settings. Device settings may include such things as a tachy rate zone, a brady pacing mode, one or more thresholds of tachy discrimination algorithms, a tachy therapy parameter, a morphological template, a brady therapy parameter, one or more thresholds of heart failure decompensation detection algorithms, one or more thresholds of apnea detection algorithms, a patient name, a patient gender, a patient birth date, a patient height, a patient weight, a patient New York Heart Association class, a patient left ventricular ejection fraction, a physician contact information or other settings, preferences, options, or threshold values that may be stored on a device to control its operation. At  402 , the source device settings are stored in local memory in an intermediary transfer device. At  404 , the source device settings are reconfigured, if necessary, to be compatible with a target device. FIG. 5  is a flowchart illustrating a method  308  for processing data for transfer to a target device. At  500 , the method  308  accesses physiological data. In an example, the physiological data is provided directly by the source device. In another example, the physiological data is accessed from a storage device, such as a memory stick or a hard drive, which contains some of all of the physiological data collected by the source device. At  502 , the method  308  determines if the data was processed by the source device. In an example, a lookup table is used to record and track which signals are modified or processed on which devices in which modes. Also, an indication of how the signals were modified or processed is recorded in the lookup table for later reference when determining how to invert or revert such processing. For example, the source device may collect raw signal data and then process it, such as with a signal processing function, and only store the processed signal data. Signal processing functions may include a frequency-selective function, an upsampling function, a downsampling function, a re-sampling function, a filtering function, an amplifying function, an attenuating function, an averaging function, a function to calculate the median, mode, standard deviation or quartiles, a function to build a histogram, a function to estimate a probability distribution function or cumulative distribution function or a compressing function in various examples. Alternatively, the source device may store the raw or lesser-processed sensed signal data either alone or in combination with more-processed data. In an example, if both a lesser-processed signal data set and a more-processed signal data set are available, the method  308  can attempt to de-process the lesser-processed signal data first. This may advantageously avoid introducing artifacts when trying to reverse the additional processing undergone by the more-processed signal data set. At  504 , if the signal data was initially processed by the source device, then the data is at least partially de-processed, such as to substantially revert to the original signal data format. For example, a source IMD may sense electrocardiogram data and use a first filter function H 1  to filter the incoming signal to remove noise and provide a cleaner signal to analyze. In order to de-process or substantially revert the data toward the original signal form, the method  308  may apply an inverse filter function H −1′   1 , where “′” indicates that H −1′   1  is an estimate of an inverse function of H 1 , as an exact inverse function may not be possible due to mathematical limitations or limitations of physics. In some examples, the first filter function H 1  is a linear determined 1:1 process and thus, an actual inverse filter function H −1′   1  can be realized and implemented such that H −1′   1 =H −1   1  and the resulting signal has no distortion. In examples, the inverse filter function H −1′   1  is applied in a time domain or a frequency domain. In a further example, the inverse filter function H −1′   1  includes an amplitude-modification function. For example, a first IMD may provide 8-bit data storage whereas a second IMD may provide 12-bit data storage. To properly transform binary data from the first IMD&#39;s format to the second IMD&#39;s format, a left shift of 4 bits is used, which will appropriately scale the binary data to the second IMD&#39;s native format. As another example, if an input signal was subjected to automatic gain control or intentional gain compression (e.g., non-linear gain) at a first IMD, to compensate, one or more functions may be used to reverse the first IMD&#39;s transfer function to produce substantially un-processed data. In a further example, either the actual inverse filter function H −1   1  or the estimated inverse filter function H −1′   1  may be determined based on population data of patients with the same or similar devices, or with devices that implement the same acquisition filter function H 1 . In such an example, the inverse filter function (e.g., H −1   1 , H −1′   1 ) can be approximated using methods such as adaptive filtering or using a neural network, which seek to minimize signal distortion until, for example, the distortion meets a “minimum distortion” criteria or threshold. In general, a population-based derivation method may be helpful in the cases where it is difficult or computationally expensive to directly derive H −1   1  from H 1  or when a derivation results in unacceptable distortion. In an example, the inverse filter function H −1′   1  is designed such that a comparison between the reconstructed signal and the original raw signal indicate minimal distortion. For example, the inverse filter function H −1′   1  is designed to minimize one or more of a mean squared error, a minimum phase shift, a minimum dominant frequency component deterioration, a reserved signal-to-noise ratio, or a high cross-correlation between the raw and the reconstructed signal data. Similarly, if multiple signal processing functions were used during data acquisition, then one or more other signal processing functions can be reversed by applying one or more other corresponding inverse or reverse signal processing functions. Using either an analytical or a data-driven (e.g., population-based) method a maximum error or distortion in signal magnitude or phase introduced by H −1′   1  can be determined. The maximum error may be used to indicate quantitatively how good the estimate H −1′   1  is. Using the quantitative value as an “error bound” of the reconstructed signal, the rate of false detection (due to magnitude distortion) and/or the timing error of the detected event (due to phase distortion) may be determined and used to adjust discrimination processes when detecting an event. At  506 , a target device is determined. The target device may include a second (replacement) IMD, a workstation in a research computer system or a database in a centralized patient management system. In addition, the target device may be an offline storage device or a simulation or analysis machine. At  508 , the physiological data is transformed to the target device&#39;s format. For example, the target may be an IMD that uses its own signal processing function H 2 . In order to transform the physiological data obtained from the source IMD to simulate data captured on the target IMD, an associated function H 2 ′ can be used. Again, the “′” indicates that H 2 ′ is an estimate of H 2 , as it may not be possible to recreate H 2  exactly due to mathematical limitations or limitations of physics. In some examples, H 2 =H 2 ′, such that the function used to transform or make the data compatible with the target device is the same as that used by the target device during its own data acquisition process. In other examples, a different function or group of functions may be used to prepare the data for the target device. FIG. 6  is a flowchart illustrating a method  308  for processing data for transfer to a target device. At  600 , the method  308  accesses physiological data. At  602 , the method  308  determines if the data was processed by the source device. Processes and methods used to access and determine if the data was processed by the source device are substantially similar to those described above ( 500  and  502  in  FIG. 5 ).",

Discussion of Prior Art It is a common difficulty, when using automatic dishwashers, that undesirable movement results in chipping and/or breakage of articles such as glasses, cups, dishes and/or plates. Generally, during a dishwashing cycle, these articles, which are placed relatively loosely within the dishwasher rack, are subject to substantial movement and subsequent damage from contact with other articles or the rack frame. A variety of straps and eyelets or rings have been used in the prior art for different purposes. KOLSTRAND, U.S. Pat.

No. 1,075,589, discloses a ring for attaching two straps to each other. SCHRODER, German Pat. Nos. 594,413 and 605,513, both disclose apparatus for attaching two flexible cords to each other. None of these apparatus, however, discloses or suggests the use of a flexible elongated member for the purpose of securing one or more frangible articles in a rack; and clearly none disclose the use of such device for flexibly and securely retaining frangible articles in one or more racks of an automatic dishwasher. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is a general object of the present invention to provide a new and improved device for securely fastening breakable articles in a dishwasher rack. Another object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved strap assembly for securely fastening breakable articles within a dishwasher rack, which assembly can be flexibly and variably positioned on the rack by being attached to the generally upright fingers of the rack. Yet a further object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved device for flexibly and securely positioning frangible articles within a dishwasher rack, which device is adapted to fit variously sized articles and which is therefore stretchable/flexible to that end. Still a further object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved strapping device for flexibly and securely fastening breakable articles in a dishwasher rack which can come in a variety of embodiments to securely position one or more of such articles of various sizes and shapes on the rack. Another object of the present invention is to provide a new and improved device for flexibly and securely attaching breakable articles to a dishwasher rack and which includes a process for manufacturing the device. The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be more fully described throughout this application. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In a first aspect thereof, the present invention provides a strap assembly for retaining at least one article on a rack; the strap assembly comprises at least three spaced apart, substantially annular eyelets; at least one elongated resilient cord comprising means for resiliently connecting a first one of the eyelets to a second one of the eyelets; and means for positioning a third one of the eyelets at a location on the at least one cord which is substantially centrally located between the first eyelet and the second eyelet. The strap assembly can comprise two elongated resilient cord sections, with a first elongated cord section connecting the first eyelet to the third eyelet, and a second elongated cord section connecting the second eyelet to the third eyelet. Each cord section may be connected to the exterior peripheral surface of each of the eyelets; and each of the eyelets comprises a brass ring. In this fashion, a single cord can be used for two embodiments of the strapping assembly. Each of the eyelets can either be coated with rubber, or can remain uncoated. Further, each of the eyelets can include a central rubber grommet positioned within the interior of the eyelet, and each of the cord sections can comprise a rubber cord encased in a nylon sleeve material. The cord sections can be of different lengths, or each of the cord sections can be the same length. The strap assembly can further comprise a third cord section and a fourth eyelet, with the third cord section being attached at a first end to the second eyelet and attached at a second end thereof to the fourth eyelet. This cord section is attached to an exterior peripheral surface of the each of the third and fourth eyelets. The length of the third cord section may be less than the length of each of the first and second cord sections, or all of the cord sections can have equal lengths. The third eyelet can alternately be loosely fitted about the circumference of the at least one cord along a plane which is substantially perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the cord. In this case, the strap assembly will further comprise a second cord which is substantially perpendicular to the first cord and which is connected about the periphery of a fourth eyelet at a second end of the second cord, the second cord being attached at its first end to the third eyelet. A third cord is positioned in a substantially parallel fashion to the first cord, and fifth and sixth eyelets are attached to first and second ends of the third cord, respectively. The second cord can be shorter than either or both of the first and third cords. Each of the eyelets can comprise a central hub having crimpable or foldable upper and lower flanges; each flange has an edge portion adapted to be crimped or folded into a position substantially perpendicular to the flanges, wherein at least one cord or cord section is securely positioned between the hub and the folded flanges of each eyelet.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to the use of a nucleic acid, such as DNA as an antioxidant. It includes nucleic acid antioxidant compositions and methods of obtaining such compositions. It also includes formulations in which a nucleic acid is used as an antioxidant. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Antioxidants are widely used to preserve a variety of materials including food, vitamins, and pharmaceuticals. Such materials are naturally degraded by oxidants, such as oxygen radicals, present in the material or its environment. These oxidants are highly reactive and accordingly bond to and/or break down other chemicals in the material, resulting in the appearance of undesirable properties in the material. To avoid these undesirable effects, an antioxidant may be added to the material. The antioxidant has a strong affinity for oxidants and therefore provides a preferred reactant. Some such reactions may produce an undesirable by-product, but many do not. Antioxidants used for preservative purposes are selected to avoid undesirable by-products. Foods commonly treated with antioxidants include oils, which are often used for cooking and tend to oxidize more rapidly at higher temperatures, oil-containing foods such as coffee, and dried foods. Many vitamins, including Vitamins C and E, are themselves antioxidants and therefore are rapidly degraded unless another antioxidant is provided with the vitamin. A large number of pharmaceuticals, such as synthetic estrogens, also benefit from the addition of antioxidants, especially if oxidative damage may result in a toxic by-product. In addition to their preservative effects, many antioxidants also have physiological effects. Antioxidants are known to reduce the inflammatory response and may be used in conjunction with other drugs to treat conditions resulting from or worsened by inflammation. Additionally, it is believed that ingestion of some antioxidants, such as Vitamins C and E, helps prevent cancer and other disorders caused by oxidative damage to the body. Accordingly, many antioxidants are available at present. These include artificial antioxidants such as butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and tert-butyl hydroquinone (TBHQ). Vitamin E, generally used to describe a class of chemicals known as “tocopherols”, and Vitamin C, also commonly called “ascorbic acid”, are also used as antioxidants. Natural antioxidants such as tea extracts and extracts of herbs such as rosemary are also used for antioxidant purposes. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention includes a method of preserving a material subject to oxidative damage by adding purified nucleic acid to the material. The nucleic acid reduces the rate of oxidative damage of the material. In specific embodiments of the present invention, the nucleic acid may include DNA. The material subject to oxidative damage may be a vitamin such as Vitamin C or Vitamin E. The material subject to oxidative damage may also be a food, and antioxidant, a lipid or a pharmaceutical. In specific embodiments where the material subject to oxidative damage is hydrophilic, the purified nucleic acid may be in an aqueous solution. Where the material subject to oxidative damage is hydrophobic, the nucleic acid may be supplied in a solvent with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions or as aggregates of nucleic acid less than 50 μM in diameter. In certain embodiments, the purified nucleic acid may be sprayed on the surface of the material subject to oxidative damage. The invention also includes a composition including a material subject to oxidative damage and an amount of purified nucleic acid sufficient to reduce the rate of oxidative damage to the material. In specific embodiments, the nucleic acid may include DNA. The material subject to oxidative damage may be a vitamin such as Vitamin C or Vitamin E. The material subject to oxidative damage may also be a food, and antioxidant, a lipid, such as a lipid heated above ambient temperature, or a pharmaceutical, such as a synthetic estrogen.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to a retrieval system for retrieving of an object within the vasculature of the body, and more particularly to a retrieval system which may be used in the removal of a medical device within a blood vessel. More specifically, the retrieval system may take the form of an embolic coil retrieval system to be used in the removal or repositioning of embolic coils within the brain. 2. Description of the Prior Art For many years physicians have been placing various devices within a blood vessel of the human body in order to treat an aneurysm or to occlude a vessel by promoting thrombus formation. Such devices include dilatation balloons, liquid medications, stents, and embolic coils. Embolic coils may take the form of helically wound coils, randomly wound coils, coils wound within other coils, or many other coil configurations. These coils are generally formed of radiopaque metallic materials, such as platinum, gold, and tungsten, or alloys of these metals. U.S. Pat. No. 6,179,857 entitled, “Stretch Resistant Embolic Coil with Variable Stiffness” discloses one such embolic coil design. The coil disclosed in this patent is a helically wound coil in which various combinations of adjacent turns are spot welded together to create a stretch resistant coil of a preselected flexibility. U.S. Pat. No. 6,183,491 entitled, “Embolic Coil Deployment System with Improved Embolic Coil” discloses another coil configuration which shows an embolic coil having a relatively flexible proximal portion which resists stretching. Instead of placing an embolic coil within an aneurysm to prevent the flow of blood, a stent may be used to treat an aneurysm. U.S. Pat. No. 6,267,783 to Robert P. Letendre, et al discloses one such stent. The stent disclosed in this patent is a self-expanding stent which may be placed within the parent vessel of the aneurysm and positioned over the mouth of the aneurysm to block the flow of blood. Another stent aneurysm treatment device is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,361,558 entitled, “Stent Aneurysm Treatment System and Method” and assigned to the same assignee as the present application. That patent discloses vasculature stents of various configurations which may also be used as aneurysm covers for occluding, or partially occluding, aneurysms located at various positions along blood vessels. In certain instances an embolic coil or stent must be removed from the vessel and either repositioned or replaced. Furthermore, a stent may require replacement because it has outlived its useful life. One known procedure for embolic coil or stent removal is surgically removing the device from the vessel. This method however can be time consuming and traumatic to the patient. The development of flexible medical instruments has made it possible to remove embolic coils and stents using minimally invasive surgical procedures. U.S. Pat. No. 5,098,440 entitled, “Object Retrieval Method and Apparatus” and assigned to the same assignee as the present invention discloses one such device. This patent discloses an apparatus which captures a stent with two criss-cross wire loops. These wire loops slip over a stent, and when the ends of the wires are retracted the loops tighten down on the stent. The stent is captured and withdrawn into a guide catheter. U.S. Pat. No. 5,217,484 entitled, “Retractable Wire Catheter Device and Method” discloses another apparatus which may be used to retrieve or adjust the position of a deployed vaso-occlusive device. This patent discloses a catheter device having a multi-jaw clamp. When the clamp is placed over a vaso-occlusion wire, a pusher wire is retracted to close the jaws of the clamp thereby capturing the wire for retrieval. A spring jaw medical instrument is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,782,747 entitled, “Spring Based Multi-purpose Medical Instrument.” That apparatus, used for capturing an intravascular object, has a variety of jaw structures including a configuration having opposing serrated surfaces for crushing an object and a configuration having a closed loop jaw suitable for grasping an object. Also, U.S. Pat. No. 5,840,043 entitled, “Jaw Assembly for an Endoscopic Instrument” discloses a retrieval apparatus. This patent describes an instrument which includes a jaw assembly having cups with radially arranged teeth. The jaw assembly with this knife-sharp rim is actuated by a push/pull wire which allows physicians to obtain a multiple sample bioptome. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION There is a need for an improved apparatus and method for retrieving a medical device from the vasculature of the human body. More particularly, there is a need for an apparatus that has a very small diameter and has a jaw assembly which will capture an embolic coil and hold the coil tightly until removed from the vasculature of the body. Such an apparatus could be placed in a very small microcatheter for subsequent positioning within a vessel of the human brain. Obviously, such vessels are extremely small and very tortuous throughout their length. In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an embolic coil retrieval system for capturing an embolic coil in a vessel of the body. The embolic coil retrieval system includes a sheath which takes the form of a flexible elongated tube with a lumen extending therethrough. The sheath has a proximal section and a distal section. The embolic coil retrieval system also includes an embolic coil retriever having a cylindrical member with a proximal section, a distal section, and a lumen extending therethrough. The embolic coil retriever also has a jaw member including a first jaw, a second jaw, and a third jaw. Each jaw takes the form of a longitudinal portion of an elongated tubular member. Each jaw has a proximal end, a distal end, a first longitudinal edge, and a second longitudinal edge. The proximal ends of the jaws are attached to the distal section of the cylindrical member. Two of the jaws are biased outwardly away from a longitudinal axis of the elongated tubular member. The embolic coil retriever further has a plurality of teeth each having a base. Each tooth generally takes the form of a triangular member. The base of each tooth is attached to the jaw member. Also, the embolic coil retrieval system includes an actuator wire having a proximal end and a distal end. The wire is slideably disposed within the lumen of the sheath. The distal end of the wire is attached to the proximal section of the cylindrical member. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided an embolic coil retriever for capturing an embolic coil in a vessel of the body. The embolic coil retriever includes a cylindrical member having a proximal section, a distal section, and a lumen extending therethrough.

    "abstract": "The invention is for use in the medical field of hyperthermia treatment, i.e., heating tissue via electromagnetic radiation. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION It is well known among medical practitioners that a patient with a cancerous tumor can be treated successfully by a process which raises the temperature of the tumor. This treatment is generally referred to as hyperthermia. Remission of a tumor can be affected by elevating its temperature to 40°≦T≦44° C. It is desirable to provide for a uniform temperature distribution within the treated tissue. One method of hyperthermia treatment is the use of electromagnetic radiation energy. The temperature of the tissue irradiated by the energy is a function of the power or intensity of the signal applied to the surface of the body tissue. The depth of penetration into the body is an inverse function of the signal frequency employed. The volume of the tissue to be treated is controlled by the electrical and geometrical design of the signal applicator. It is known that a flexible applicator can be utilized to conform to irregular surfaces. Electromagnetic applicators radiate waves which propagate at the speed of light, 300,000 km/sec in a vacuum, or slower in matter. Such waves are characterized by both a propagation direction and a vector polarization. Prior methods of hyperthermia treatment employ a waveguide applicator to supply the signal for irradiation of the treated tissue. The distribution of the irradiating signal from the waveguide applicator is manifested as a pattern of standing waves of the operating frequency. The standing wave distribution produces maximum and minimum voltage points which develop non-uniform irradiating signals, correspondingly producing undesirable non-uniform heating of the treated tissue. An optimal non-invasive applicator delivers maximum power to the tumor while minimally heating surrounding healthy tissue. Since waves attenuate, i.e., deposit power, as they penetrate lossy tissue, a focusing source arrangement is required. Constructive interference at the tumor is obtained by adjusting the phase and amplitude of each point of the signal source. For constructive interference at the focal point, the electrical field at the tissue surface must be properly aligned and phased so that waves propagating along all paths in the entire tissue volume arrive in the same fashion. Merely adjusting phase, polarization, and amplitude for maximum focusing, however, does not necessarily produce an acceptable power-density distribution. It remains a problem that certain areas receive significantly more energy than adjacent areas, i.e., non-uniform heating. It is well known that waveguide transmission lines can efficiently conduct or transmit electromagnetic energy. Waveguides such as this that are useful for carrying electromagnetic energy in the frequency range below one gigahertz, however, are also generally large and cumbersome unless they are dielectrically loaded, or filled, with a dielectric material having a dielectric constant substantially greater than unity. A further requirement of applicators is a capacity to monitor power being deposited in the exposed tissue. Applied dosage information may be used as an approximate substitute for the difficult problem of direct, non-invasive temperature measurement. Specific prior art hyperthermia techniques and apparatus therefor include: U.S. Pat. No. 4,197,860 issued 15 Apr. 1980 to Sterzer; U.S. Pat. No. 4,633,875 issued 6 Jan. 1987 to Turner; and U.S. Pat. No. 4,934,365 issued 19 Jun. 1990 to Morgenthaler. U.S. Pat. No. 4,179,860 discloses a hyperthermia applicator and feedback control using a completely independent, i.e., non-integrated, albeit non-invasive, radiometer for sensing temperature of the heated tissue. When the sensed temperature exceeds the upper bound of a desired range, heating is inhibited. Heating is restarted after the sensed temperature falls below the lower bound of the desired range. The antenna in the applicator is a flat array of printed dipoles that does not act as a coaxially structured antenna and thus fails to produce a transverse electromagnetic (TEM) mode. Further, the antenna suffers the problem of producing dispersed hot spots. Also, nothing is disclosed or suggested about regulating the temperature of the dielectric within the applicator. U.S. Pat. No. 4,633,875 discloses a hyperthermia applicator of waveguide construction having feedback control, albeit employing invasive temperature sensors. Invasive techniques are not desirable because they increase the trauma to the patient and risk the mixing of abnormal cells (those being treated) into healthy tissue. Here also, the rectangular waveguide does not operate in the TEM mode. U.S. Pat. No. 4,934,365 discloses a hyperthermia applicator of troughguide construction which also suffers the problem of dispersed hot spots. It merely suggests the possibility of electronic feedback control, stopping short of suggesting thermometry feedback (be it invasive or non-invasive). Here, the radiometry employed is not microwave radiometry nor is the TEM mode produced. Other attempts have been made to use the same antenna structure for both transmitting/heating and radiometry purposes. But since radiometry is best suited to using multifrequencies ranging from 1 to 4 GHz and the applicator is best suited to using one frequency between 100 MHz and 1 GHz, such a dual-function antenna has to be very broadband. No one has had success with such an arrangement. Thus, the prior art has failed to teach an applicator having incorporated therein a radiometric receiving antenna. Further, the prior art has failed to teach such a combined antennas producing a TEM mode having a principal, non-dispersed maxima. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide an integrated, dual-functional hyperthermia apparatus for both non-invasive heating and sensing temperature non-invasively (for feedback control). It is an object of the present invention that the construction of the applicator be a modified horn. It is an object of the present invention that the applicator be coupled to the body using a bolus interface, the bolus being filled with dielectric.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates generally to a decompression catheter, which might find application, for example, in small bowel enteroclysis. 2. Brief Description of the Background Oral methods are often advantageous in the medical examination of the small bowel, mainly due to the ease of performance. In this regard, enteroclysis is often considered a preferred oral method for examining the small bowel for irregularities, as it overcomes some of the interpretive and technical errors present in other oral methods. Enteroclysis presents several practical and diagnostic advantages. Accordingly, this oral method has been used to successfully diagnose a wide variety of lesions. One advantage of enteroclysis over other oral methods of evaluating the small bowel is that it bypasses the regulation of the stomach and pylorus. Also, contrast material may be delivered at a preselected optimized rate. Further, direct infusion of the contrast material into the small bowel achieves simultaneous demonstration of all loops in the distended bowel. Thus, fold patterns are more accurately evaluated and surface abnormalities may show up more definitely. An additional advantage of enteroclysis is that the examination may be performed in a relatively short period of time. It has been suggested that a catheter ideal for performing enteroclysis should incorporate certain features. It must be long enough to reach the infusion site and still allow the patient freedom to shift positions during the infusion. The diameter of the enteroclysis catheter should be minimized so that irritation to the nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal tracts is minimized. Provision for preventing reflux of the infusion material into the stomach or decompressing refluxed contrast material in the stomach is advantageous. See, Maglinte D. T., Small Bowel Radiography: How, When, and Why?, Radiology 1987; 163:297-305. The decompression catheter of the present invention supplies all the above features. Importantly, it incorporates an additional feature. Frequently, the infusion ports of enteroclysis catheters become obstructed with body tissue or other material, making further injection or withdrawal impossible. Thus, the additional feature is one which clears obstructed ports of the catheter so that injection or withdrawal may proceed. Previously available small bowel decompression catheters are typically double-lumen catheters. These catheters take time to position in the proximal small bowel for effective decompression. In addition, the immediate performance of enteroclysis to ascertain the site and severity of the obstruction is not possible as these catheters are not adapted for contrast infusion into the bowel. When contrast media is injected, backflow into the stomach occurs because of the position of the holes in the end of the catheter. The decompression catheter of the present invention, designed with a triple-lumen and incorporating a balloon, can be readily positioned directly in the proximal small bowel for effective decompression. It is adapted also for immediate enteroclysis for determination of the site and severity of obstruction or other diagnostic and intervention procedures. Further, a double sump is present which enables clearing of the infusion or withdrawal ports. Also, the distal portion may be tapered to minimize nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal irritation during insertion. Several drainage and/or irrigation devices are presently known. None, however, are well-suited for oral examination of the small bowel. Wilkinson, U.S. Pat. No. 4,364,394, discloses a combined sump drainage and irrigation device for evacuating liquid, blood or exudate from the peritoneal cavity for prolonged periods. The device incorporates a balloon to prevent dislocation of the device from the incision and a means to aid in equalizing pressure, inhibiting blockage of the suction passage. An infusion passage extends well beyond the distal end of the device&#39;s main body. Onat, U.S. Pat. No. 4,114,625, teaches an oral-nasal gastric tube which includes three passages, one for inflating a balloon. The remaining two tubes open independently external of the device. One tube may be left open to the atmosphere to equalize pressure within the body. Moss, U.S. Pat. No. 4,642,092, discloses a gastrointestinal aspirating device insertable through the body wall to prevent abdominal distension which frequently occurs when providing nutrition. Primary and smaller, secondary orifices are present in the aspirating lumen so that, should the primary orifices become blocked, the secondary orifices allow a pressure increase (a decrease in the level of suction) within the aspirating lumen. A Ring-McLean sump drainage set, useful in draining abscesses, is also available. It is introducable by direct puncture from a trochar needle disposed therein. A secondary lumen allows pressure equalization at the distal tip of the catheter or flushing of the primary lumen via a syringe attachment. None of the above devices disclose the principle of the present invention. That is, none disclose a catheter ideal for use in oral small bowel medical examinations. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a multi-lumen catheter incorporating a balloon inflatable through one of the lumens. Two remaining lumens communicate internally of the catheter through staggered lateral ports. The paired, smaller ports of the smaller remaining lumen open internally of the catheter into the largest lumen and are aligned with the ports of the larger remaining lumen. The catheter according to this embodiment has a tapered distal portion. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved decompression catheter which can be readily positioned in the proximal small bowel for effective decompression. It is another object to provide a decompression catheter adapted for immediate enteroclysis to determine the site and severity of small bowel obstruction. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a new and improved decompression catheter incorporating a feature for maintaining patency during enteroclysis. A further object of the present invention is to provide a decompression catheter capable of aspirating refluxed fluid from the stomach. A still further object of the present invention is to provide a catheter which is acceptable to the patient during intubation.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to a pillow for a child, and in particular, to a pillow adapted to provide support to a child&#39;s head and neck while seated in a car seat. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Infants are delicate beings, and they require the utmost care in order protect them and keep them safe from harm. One (1) of the most common items utilized to protect infants is a car seat. A car seat holds an infant in place to protect them while being transported in a motor vehicle. A problem associated with conventional car seats is that they are generally ergonomically unfriendly and place more emphasis on restraint than comfort. In particular, the child&#39;s head tends to end up at awkward angles when the child is sleeping. Prolonged placement of a child&#39;s neck and head at a poor angle causes a number of problems. This is uncomfortable for the child and can cause great distress when the child wakes. Furthermore, this causes a large amount stress on the child&#39;s neck which can cause strain and even damage. This is particularly dangerous in the event of a sudden stop or crash. Various attempts have been made to provide support pillows adapted for use in a vehicle. Examples of these attempts can be seen by reference to several U.S. patents including U.S. Pat. No. 4,786,080; U.S. Pat. No. 4,838,611; U.S. Pat. No. 5,064,245; U.S. Pat. No. 5,330,255; U.S. Pat. No. 5,785,388; U.S. Pat. No. 6,457,195; and U.S. Pat. No. 6,554,363. Additionally, ornamental designs for a neck support pillow exist, such as U.S. Pat. No. D 322,380. However, none of these designs are similar to the present invention. While these devices fulfill their respective, particular objectives, each of these references suffer from one (1) or more disadvantages. Many such devices are not readily adjustable. Many such devices do not work for a child, particularly a sleeping child, as they assume a certain level of coordination on the part of the user. Many such devices are not easily adaptable for use with a car seat. Furthermore, many such devices are adapted for comfort but not support, or are not adapted to support and protect the neck and head of a sleeping child. Accordingly, there exists a need for a support pillow for a child in a car seat without the disadvantages as described above. The development of the present invention substantially departs from the conventional solutions and in doing so fulfills this need. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In view of the foregoing references, the inventor recognized the aforementioned inherent problems and observed that there is a need for a support adapted for use by a child while in a car seat, which provides unconditional comfort and support in an easily installed and adjustable manner. Thus, the object of the present invention is to solve the aforementioned disadvantages and provide for this need. To achieve the above objectives, it is an object of the present invention to provide a pair of pillows for supporting each side of a child&#39;s head in an upright position while the child is seated in a child car seat. Each pillow assembly comprises an inflatable pillow having a removable cover and a pillow strap for attached the device to a car seat. Another object of the present invention is to removably attach each pillow assembly to a seat belt of a child car seat utilizing a strap attached to the attached to each pillow cover. The straps include fasteners that allow the straps to encircle and secure to the seat belt. Yet still another object of the present invention is to comprise each pillow of a kidney-shape that provides a comfortable contoured surface conforming to the profile of a child&#39;s neck and lower head. The pillows provide upright support to both sides of the child&#39;s head and neck as well as forward support to the child&#39;s chin area to ensure that the child&#39;s neck remains at a safe and comfortable angle at all times, even while sleeping. Yet still another object of the present invention is to comprise each inflatable pillow of a foam pillow having a nozzle for selectively inflating the pillow. Each nozzle comprises a vented cap valve that enables air to enter the foam body and remain within the body to maintain its expanded form. The nozzle can be opened to remove are from within the body until a desired level of support is achieved. Yet still another object of the present invention is to comprise each cover of a removable fabric cover for providing comfort against a child&#39;s skin during use, providing protection to the inflatable pillow, and enabling removal of the cover for purposes of washing or replacement. Each cover further comprises a nozzle aperture enabling manipulation of the nozzles while the cover is in place. Yet still another object of the present invention is to provide a method of utilizing the device that provides a unique means of attaching a pair of pillow assemblies onto respective seat belts using the straps; actuating the nozzles to inflate or deflate each pillow as desired; positioning a child with respect to the pillows such that the apparatus provides support to both sides of the child&#39;s head and neck areas; and, increasing the comfort and providing increased safety for the child. Further objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from a consideration of the drawings and ensuing description.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to an system that improves a user&#39;s sitting posture. In particular, the system improves posture of a user while sitting at a desk. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION As more people use computers in the workplace, proper posture when sitting is increasingly becoming a personal and economic issue. Billions of dollars are lost each year by companies through lost productivity and health care costs due to cases of back pain caused by prolonged sitting behind computers and at factory work stations. Back pain is a leading contributor to losses in workplace productivity in the United States. According to one 2006 study, back pain was reported by 42.6% of workers surveyed, and “back pain in workers 40 to 65 years of age costs employers an estimated $7.4 billion/year.” The American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons reports that a total of 186.7 million work days were lost in 2004 due to back pain. Such pain plays a major role in increasing health costs and reducing the quality of people&#39;s lives. It would appear, that as individuals spend more time in front of computers, the incidence of such back problems has increased. A 2008 article published in the  Journal of the American Medical Association  estimates that healthcare expenditures related to spine problems in the United States totaled $89.5 billion in 2005, a 65% increase from expenditures in 1997. The Mayo Clinic points to improper posture as one of the major causes of back pain in the workplace, and recommends proper posture while sitting as a step to prevent back pain and injury at work. Proper posture involves keeping both feet on the ground and knees level with hips. The lower back should be properly supported, and sitters should be upright and relaxed, neither slumping over nor arching their backs. While ergonomically designed chairs can help sitting posture, and individuals can work to train themselves to sit properly, most people tend to become lapse and have difficulty maintaining good habits. One of the most common posture problems, called kyphosis, is a direct result of spending too much time in front of a computer, experts say. The shoulders hunch forward, the pectoral muscles in the chest tighten, the neck and head extend toward the computer screen, and the spine is no longer vertically aligned. Many deskbound office workers have started standing and walking in this position, too, says Andrea Cheville, a rehabilitation physician at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. To counteract kyphosis, it is important to stretch the pectoral muscles and strengthen the trapezius muscles in the upper back, which hold the shoulder blades back, Dr. Cheville said. Remembering to keep the ears and head over the shoulders, and not jutting forward, is also important. Posture is “probably the 800-pound gorilla when it comes to health and wellness,” says Allston Stubbs, an orthopedic surgeon at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, in Winston-Salem, N.C., who treats patients with back or joint pain. “We see the spine and overall skeletal structure being critical to a patient&#39;s functionality and their satisfaction with their life and health care.” Billions of dollars are being spent by government, companies and individuals on functional health problems that are all too frequently a result of simple poor posture at work. And tens of millions of people are forced to suffer pain in their everyday lives, pain that might have been avoided with proper working posture. Yet the prior attempts at helping resolve this problem have fallen short. There are many “ergonomic” chairs that help support a user&#39;s back, but these are premised on older ways of working, such as sitting back in a chair and speaking on the phone. In fact, in the digital age workers are leaning forward to view a screen, and back support is not really helpful, since when leaning forward a worker&#39;s back is not in contact with the chair. As mentioned above, typical prior art for ergonomic workstations is in the form of a chair. This type of prior art chair has a back support that follows the contour of the natural curvature of the spine but the user is required to sit with his back against the back support for the entire spine to be supported. However, when a user is sitting and working at a desk, the user often leans forward towards the desk, slouches and not utilizes the back support of the chair for support. By leaning forward or slouching, users risk straining the piriformis muscle and sciatic nerve, the two main causes of pain in the lower back and buttocks. Sciatica and “piriformis syndrome,” neuromuscular disorders that cause pain, tingling and numbing in the buttocks that extend down the leg, are the main causes for ergonomic-related worker absenteeism. According to the Mayo Clinic, slouching exaggerates a back&#39;s natural curves, which can lead to muscle fatigue and injury. Leaning forward, particularly under stress for long periods of time, strains muscles. Other prior art that attempts to provide posture support when a user leans forward also takes the form of a chair. Instead of a back support, a front support is provided at the front of the chair. See U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,619,747, 4,832,407, and 3,754,787. In order for such chair to provide proper support, the user must straddle the chair and sit with his chest against the front support. The requirement to straddle such prior art chair is inconvenient for some users and may be difficult for users with mobility issues, as well as challenging for female users, who make up a large percentage of the computer-working population. One major disadvantage of the prior art chairs is that they are typically configured to be “one size fit all.” While certain adjustments can be made to customize prior art chairs (e.g. tilt of a chair seat, reclining angle of a chair back support, seat height adjustment, etc.), it typically has a limited range of adjustments. Therefore, there is a need for an improved portable posture support system that addresses the work-posture problem for all users from the front, not the back, while a user is at a desk that is convenient to use and convenient for the user to ensure proper posture while seated. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a posture support system that makes use of a desk for stabilization, and is not a chair. The posture support system of the present invention comprises a base portion, a vertical arm portion extending from the base portion, a horizontal arm portion extending from the vertical arm portion, and a support portion extending from the horizontal arm portion. The interaction among the vertical arm portion, horizontal arm portion and support portion are fully adjustable to accommodate all different users. The posture support system of the present invention comprises a rectangular base the size of a computer keyboard to which is attached an adjustable vertical arm. Attached to the vertical arm is a horizontal arm with a cushion support. The posture support system of the present invention is placed on a flat surface, such as a desk. The base portion is removably positioned on the flat surface, as far or close to the edge of the flat surface according to the needs of the user. The base portion may have a lip that extends downward over the edge of a desk, which serves to prevent movement of the base portion and optionally allows the base portion to be fixedly attached to the desk by any fastening means. The vertical arm portion is preferably slightly curved towards the user and adjustable to different heights according to the user&#39;s height. The horizontal arm portion includes a pivotable joint that allows the support portion (cushion) to be adjusted and positioned at different height and angle for the user&#39;s comfort when the user&#39;s upper chest rests against the support portion. The design of the system provides resistance and spinal support for a user who tends to lean forward or slouch while seated at a desk. The system can be temporarily or permanently mounted to a flat surface, such as a desk. The posture support system of the present invention is designed to provide resistance for a user who leans toward his workstation and to physically support a user in maintaining a seated position that adheres to ergonomic standards. The posture support system of the present invention is designed to induce proper seated posture from a biomechanical perspective, which, according to a consensus of medical experts, includes: (1) aligning ears over the shoulders; (2) shoulder over hips; and (3) thighs and arms perpendicular to the body. Failing to hold such posture, it is necessary for the user&#39;s back muscles to “hold up” the torso, and this constant muscular strain leads to back pain and pressure over time that degrades the spinal disks.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to the drug delivery of taxol wherein the drug is chemically bound to a water-soluble polymeric or macromolecular carrier that renders the drug water-soluble. In another aspect, the present invention relates to water-soluble prodrugs of taxol that recover their biological activity when hydrolyzed from the carrier molecule. In a further aspect, the present invention relates to sustained drug delivery of taxol by hydrolysis from an implanted gel comprising the drug-carrier conjugate. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Taxol is a natural product first isolated from the Pacific Yew tree, Taxus brevifolia, by Wani et al. (1971, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 93: 2325). Among the antimitotic agents, taxol, which contains a diterpene carbon skeleton, exhibits a unique mode of action on microtubule proteins responsible for the formation of the mitotic spindle. In contrast with other antimitotic agents such as vinblastine or colchicine, which prevent the assembly of tubulin, taxol is the only plant product known to inhibit the depolymerization process of tubulin. This prevents the cell replication process and taxol has been shown to have significant antineoplastic and anticancer effects in drug-refractory ovarian cancer. Taxol has shown excellent antitumor activity in a wide variety of tumor models such as the B16 melanoma, L1210 leukemias, MX-1 mammary tumors, and CX-1 colon tumor xenografts. Several recent press releases have termed taxol as the new anticancer wonder-drug. The poor aqueous solubility of taxol has, however, remained a setback in human clinical trials, and currently used formulations require a cremaphore to solubilize the drug. The human clinical dose range is 200-500 mg and requires about one liter of fluid given intravenously using the cremaphore. In phase I clinical trials taxol itself did not show excessive toxic effects but severe allergic reactions were caused by the emulsifiers administered to solubilize the drug. The general chemical structure of taxol is shown in FIG. 1 in which R 1  =R 2  =OH. Potential sites for modification of the drug are at the hydroxyls on the 1, 7, and 2&#39; Carbon atoms. The 1-hydroxyl is sterically hindered and nonreactive, the 2&#39;-hydroxyl is the most reactive, followed by the 7-hydroxyl which is also sterically hindered. Thus the modification of taxol to increase its water-solubility has revolved around the modification of the 2&#39;- and the 7-hydroxyls. Studies have reported that the C-13 ester side chain and the 2&#39;-hydroxyl group on the side chain are essential for biological activity. Mellado et al. (1984; Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 124:329-336) have reported the synthesis of 2&#39;-acetyl, 7-acetyl, and 2&#39;,7-diacetyl taxol. An acetyl at the 2&#39;position resulted in a loss in ability to promote microtubule assembly. Taxol and 7-acetyl taxol were similar in their ability to alter cell proliferation and microtubule polymerization. These observations suggest that the 2&#39;- and 7-positions are suitable for structural modifications, the 2&#39;-position as a site for reversible derivatization (or formation of a prodrug) and the 7-position for analogue/prodrug modifications. A number of chemically modifed taxols with enhanced water-solubilities have been developed. Among them are the sulfonated derivatives (Kingston et al., 1991; U.S. Pat. No. 5,059,699), and amino acid esters (Mathew et al., 1992; J. Med. Chem. 3B:145-151) which show significant biological activity. However, the delivery of taxol attached to a macromolecular or polymeric water-soluble carrier has not been considered. Nathan et al. (1990; Polymer Preprints 31: 213-214) have described a polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain-extended with amino acids such as lysine, to produce a polymer which has pendant carboxylic acid groups that may be used to attach biologically active molecules. However, no mention is made of the immobilization of taxol, or the attachment of a water-insoluble drug to such a carrier in order to deliver it in a soluble form. In the present invention, to deliver taxol in a water-soluble form we have used a water-soluble polymer to which the drug is bound, the resultant polymer-drug conjugate being soluble. Water-soluble polymers such as PEG, have been investigated extensively in recent years for use as nontoxic, biocompatible, protein repulsive, noninflammatory, and nonimmunogenic modifiers for drugs, proteins, enzymes, and surfaces of implanted materials. These characteristics have been variously attributed to a combination of properties of these polymers, e.g., nonionic character, water solubility, backbone flexibility, and volume exclusion effect in solution or when immobilized at a surface. The solubility of PEG in water as well as a number of common organic solvents facilitates its modification by a variety of chemical reactions and makes it amenable for binding water-insoluble or poorly water-soluble molecules and rendering them water-soluble. The preparation of a reversible PEG-taxol derivative at the 2&#39;- and/or 7-position on taxol serves as useful aqueous-soluble prodrug. A nonreversible PEG derivative on the 7-position of taxol serves as a useful water-soluble drug analogue. Advantages of delivering the drug attached to a water-soluble polymer as described in the present invention are many fold. The number of drug molecules per polymer molecule can be controlled; the circulation time of the drug can be varied by adjusting a number of variables including molecular weight of the polymeric carrier, the type of linkage between the drug and polymer, i.e., some linkages are hydrolyzed at much faster rates than others; large increases or decreases in blood levels of the drug may be avoided in favor of more gradual and sustained levels obtained, by continuous release of the drug from a polymeric carrier; and the hydrolysis of the drug-polymer conjugate results in the formation of the original biologically active drug and the innocuous water-soluble polymer that is excreted from the body. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a method of drug delivery that utilizes water-soluble polymers as carriers for a drug. The delivery of drugs that are inherently insoluble or poorly soluble in an aqueous medium can be seriously impaired if the only suitable mode of delivery is by intravenous injection. The attachment of such drugs to water-soluble macromolecules that act as carriers can greatly benefit this problem and allow for intravenous, subcutaneous, or intramuscular delivery. Examples of poorly aqueous drugs that may benefit from this form of drug delivery are taxol, amphoterecin B, etc. Examples of water-soluble polymers that may be used as carriers in such a system are polyethylene glycols (PEG), polyvinyl alcohol, polyhydroxyethyl methacrylate, polyacrylamide, polyacrylic acid, polyethyloxazoline, polyvinyl pyrrolidinone, and polysaccharides such as chitosan, alginates, hyaluronic acid, dextrans, etc. In a preferred embodiment, the drug to be delivered is taxol, a naturally occuring diterpenoid which has been described as a potent antineoplastic and anticancer agent, and the polymeric water-soluble carrier is polyethylene glycol and derivatives thereof. In another preferred embodiment, taxol is covalently linked to a PEG carboxylic acid derivative by an esterification at the 2&#39;-position on the taxol side chain. Another preferred embodiment involves the esterification of taxol at the 2&#39; position with succinic anhydride or glutaric anhydride followed by esterification with PEG to obtain the PEG-taxol derivative. In yet another preferred embodiment, a multi-arm `star` or `branched` PEG is used as the carrier to increase the loading (number of drug molecules per carrier molecule) of taxol on the PEG. In another preferred embodiment, an acrylate derivative of PEG is copolymerized with acrylic acid to obtain a copolymer with a multiplicity of carboxyl functionalities that are sites for the attachment for taxol. Another embodiment of the present invention is to covalently attach taxol to a PEG-amine derivative by first reacting taxol with carbonyldiimidazole followed by reaction with PEG-amine to obtain a urethane linkage. This link is not readily hydrolyzable and such a derivative at the 2&#39;-position interferes with the biological activity of taxol. It is therefore an embodiment of the present invention to produce such a PEG derivative at the 7-position of taxol which retains its biological activity. In another embodiment, the drug may be linked to a star or branched PEG in which a part of the endgroups of the PEG have been covalently linked to the drug while the remainder are covalently linked to an unsaturated group such as the acrylate group that may be polymerized in a free radical process to obtain a crosslinked polymer. The resultant crosslinked polymer, absorbs water in aqueous medium and results in the formation of a hydrogel containing bound drug. This hydrogel may be implanted in a suitable location subcutaneously or intraperitoneally for sustained release of the drug by hydrolysis from the insoluble crosslinked carrier. Thus it is a primary object of this invention to produce a derivative of taxol on a water-soluble macromolecule or polymer as a carrier that can be used for delivery of taxol in a soluble form. It is a further object of the present invention to use a hydrolyzable linking group such as an ester to allow for the hydrolysis of the drug-polymer conjugate subsequent to delivery of the drug to form the original active drug and polymeric carrier.",

    "abstract": "The present disclosure addresses the problems of the art by providing systems and methods for total management of liquid and solid animal wastes to control odor emissions and to prevent pollution of land and water resources. The present disclosure provides additional advantages over the art, including the ability to accommodate a high volume of water, allowing the flushing of a typical barn on at least a daily basis. This allows the removal of fresh residuals before intense odor can be generated. The anaerobic digester is enclosed so that odors are not released, and methane produced by fermentation may be captured and utilized for energy. The liquid fraction is further treated by aerobic digestion to remove organic compounds, further reducing the odor of the treated water. This water can then be recycled as high volume flush water to remove fresh residuals without causing an odor problem, and excess water is also available for irrigation. There is about a 60% reduction in dry weight of the solids in the disclosed system and the transformed remaining solids do not produce intense odors and may therefore be used for land applications. In certain preferred embodiments, the invention may be described as a system for treating animal waste, and includes the anaerobic digester(s), clarifiers and aerobic reactors configured such that the waste may be first subjected to enclosed anaerobic digestion followed by moving a liquid portion to an aerobic reactor and using clarified liquid from the aerobic reactor to flush a barn and restart the cycle. Although a preferred embodiment of such a system is described in Example 1, the system may be adapted to feeding barns designed to hold greater or few numbers of animals, either by reducing the size of the tanks, or by adding additional or larger tanks as needed. It is also understood that two or more barns may be connected to a single system, or a plurality of barns may be configured to each be connected to its own system individually. The specific systems described herein as preferred embodiments are directed to production of hogs because of the problems presented by intense hog raising and because of the high liquid content of hog waste. It is understood, however, that flush barns that are used to raise other species of domestic or farm animals or birds would also benefit from the described technology. Other animal species would include, but are not limited to beef or dairy cattle, sheep, goats, chickens, turkeys, or ratites. All such variations of the waste treatment systems are contemplated herein and fall within the scope and spirit of the appended claims.

    "abstract": "There is provided in accordance with one aspect of the present invention, a method of treating congestive heart failure. The method comprises the steps of providing an elongate flexible vascular implant, for transvenously surrounding at least a portion of the ventricle. The implant has a first attachment site spaced axially apart from a second attachment site. The first attachment site is transluminally advanced through the coronary sinus and the coronary venous system to form the implant into an open loop surrounding at least a portion of the ventricle. The size of the open loop is reduced, to restrain expansion of the encircled tissue. The first attachment site is thereafter attached to the second attachment site to close the loop and limit diastolic expansion of the left ventricle. In one embodiment, the transluminally advancing step comprises advancing a control line extending from a distal portion of the implant, through the ostium of the coronary sinus. The control line is thereafter harnessed with a snare, and drawn proximally to form the loop. The attaching the first attachment site to the second attachment site step may be accomplished by drawing a proximal end and a distal end of the implant or associated control lines through a locking clip. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a method of limiting diastolic expansion of the left ventricle. The method comprises the step of positioning a prosthesis in a coronary venous pathway which surround at least a portion of the left ventricle.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to devices positionable in body cavities for treatment or viewing and in particular to angioplasty catheters, especially for coronary and peripheral arteries. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Balloon catheters are well known for their utility in treating certain types of obstructions or occlusions in blood vessels, such as plaque build up. Angioplasty catherization typically involves aligning a balloon catheter within the vessel to position its dilatation balloon at or along the obstruction. Then, fluid under pressure is supplied to the balloon through a balloon inflation lumen in the catheter, expanding the balloon against the obstruction. Balloon angioplasty catheters have been around since the late 1970s. Since that time the efficacy for the procedure has not significantly been improved. The restenosis rate for PTCA (angioplasty) has always averaged about 40 percent. Overinflation of the balloon can cause cracks in the intimal layer of an artery, allowing smooth muscle cell proliferation. Furthermore, overinflation of the balloon is a major cause of restenosis. In extreme cases, an aneurysm or perforation of the vessel can result from overinflation. Overinflation of balloon catheters arises from several factors. One factor is the variety of plaque hardnesses. Atherosclerotic disease in an artery can result in plaque deposits having a wide range of hardness from &#34;scrambled eggs&#34; to bone. Another factor is that the profile of the obstruction is generally eccentric within the artery and does not conform to the concentric dilatation balloon profile. The physician can monitor the pressure on the inside of the balloon, but not the pressure between the outside of the balloon and the inside wall of the artery. As a result, overinflation can occur because of the concentric configuration of the balloon and the inability to assess the pressure between the outside of the balloon and the inside wall of the artery. The fluid pressure inside the inflating balloon cannot alert the physician to excessive pressure between the external surface of the balloon and the arterial wall. The application of heat to the vessel wall during the angioplasty procedure appears to have a positive effect by requiring less force to compress the plaque against the arterial wall. Conventional balloon catheters do not provide an effective means for heating vessel walls during an angioplasty procedure. Stents are also employed in arteries. However, it is difficult to determine when the stent has been fully deployed and is in contact with the vessel wall. Current angioplasty catheters do not provide a reliable means for the physician to determine if a stent is fully deployed. Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide an angioplasty balloon adapted to allow a physician to conform the balloon to an artery&#39;s inner profile, and further avoid overinflation of the balloon. Another object of the present invention is to provide an angioplasty catheter with individually inflatable dilatation compartments that allow the balloon to assume an eccentric shape and apply different localized pressure to the different regions of surrounding artery. A further object of the present invention is to provide an angioplasty catheter with pressure sensing capability on the balloon&#39;s external surface for monitoring pressure between the balloon and artery tissue allowing the catheter to be adaptable to treat different plaque hardnesses and to avoid overinflation. Another object of the present invention is to provide an angioplasty balloon catheter which may be utilized for deployment of a plastically deformable stent and for controllably expanding the stent toward a custom fit to an eccentric arterial profile. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an angioplasty balloon catheter having thin film heaters on the outside of the dilatation balloon to allow the physician to heat the obstructed area during the angioplasty procedure, or to deploy and expand recovery metal stents by locally heating a treatment site within an artery. A further object of the present invention is to provide an angioplasty balloon catheter with film transducers on the balloon&#39;s external surface to provide a means of intra vessel imaging. Still another object of the present invention is to provide an angioplasty balloon catheter with perfusion lumens extending through the catheter shaft with a port located adjacent the proximal end of the balloon and another port located adjacent the distal end of the balloon, thereby allowing fluid to flow past the catheter when the balloon is expanded and in contact with the arterial inner surface. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide dual balloon angioplasty catheter with the distal balloon opening the occlusion and the proximal balloon for deploying a stent, intra vessel ultrasonic imaging or delivering a drug to the lesion site. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION To achieve these and other objects there is provided a device for performing a balloon angioplasty procedure. The device includes an elongate catheter having a proximal end and a distal end. A dilatation balloon is fixed to the catheter tubing near the distal end and extends substantially longitudinally along the catheter tubing. The catheter is flexible and maneuverable with a guide wire to locate its distal tip within a body lumen and place the dilatation balloon within the obstructed area. Radiopaque markers on the catheter shaft under the working area of the balloon assist in positioning the balloon in the artery. The balloon has a plurality of dilatation compartments adjacent one another and arranged angularly about the catheter tubing. Fluid under pressure is individually supplied to the various dilatation compartments. Each compartment is fluid tight and isolated from the other compartments. The balloon dilatation means which supplies the fluid under pressure to the various dilatation compartments is controllable to alter the dilatation pressure to a value different than the nominal pressure in at least one of the compartments while maintaining the dilatation pressure at the nominal value in a second selected compartment. This allows the physician to controllably alter the balloon profile away from the nominal shape and toward conformity with the tissue wall profile of the tissue wall segment. The catheter tubing additionally may include at least one perfusion lumen open to the exterior of the catheter tubing at first and second locations proximal and distal relative to the balloon, respectively. When the balloon is dilated into surface engagement with the surrounding tissue wall segment, it prevents passage of fluids along the catheter tubing. Thus, the perfusion lumen allows fluid passage during the angioplasty procedure. The balloon catheter can include a pressure sensing means mounted on the exterior wall of the balloon, to measure the pressure between exterior surface of the dilatation balloon and the tissue wall segment. Preferably, the pressure sensing means includes a plurality of piezoelectric pressure transducing thin films or fluid filled pressure sensing tubes. A piezoelectric pressure transducing thin film or fluid filled pressure sensing tube is preferably bonded to each outer wall of the dilatation compartments. The pressure sensing means is coupled to a power source at the proximal end. A display means is operably connected to the sensors to display the pressure between the artery wall and the balloon&#39;s exterior surface.",

    "abstract": "The object is achieved by virtue of the fact that the cutting module is detachably fixed in the hand-held module. This means that, for example, there can always be the same hand-held module, while the cutting module is replaced. The cutting module can be replaced by a similar cutting module in the case of wear-and-tear or contamination, but the use of differently designed cutting modules for different medical actions is also feasible. In a preferred exemplary embodiment of the invention, the cutting module is embodied as a hollow cutting tube, which is connected to the hand-held module such that it can rotate about its own axis. In this case, the medical instrument forms a morcellator. The detachable connection between cutting module and hand-held module should preferably be embodied as a connection by means of a catch mechanism. This means that the cutting tube is simply inserted into the hand-held module and connected by a catch or snap-in mechanism. The cutting module can likewise be removed from the hand-held module by pulling the cutting module and/or the hand-held module. A connection by means of a catch mechanism is brought about by virtue of the fact that a catch, preferably embodied as a catch spring, is arranged on an element, which catch interacts with a corresponding catching lug in the hand-held module. Here, the catch or catch spring itself can be formed out of the cutting tube and is preferably designed to be inherently resilient such that it gives way to the inside when the cutting module is inserted into the hand-held module and thereafter snaps behind the catching lug. It likewise gives way to the inside when the cutting module is pulled out of the hand-held module, and drives over the catching lug. Here, the catching lug may be provided in an annular fashion as inner ring in a receptacle element in the hand-held module however, other options are also feasible. Moreover, an outer gear ring should be assigned to the cutting module, which outer gear ring interacts with an inner gear ring in the hand-held module. This inner gear ring is connected via a ring bevel gear to a bevel drive gear, which in turn is preferably placed on a rotational shaft of a rotor. This is how the rotational motion of the rotational shaft is transmitted to the cutting module. For the support during the rotation, preferably two spaced apart sliding bearing rings are placed on the cutting module, which sliding bearing rings rotate in corresponding sliding bearings in the receptacle element in the hand-held module. For the last-described arrangement, independent protection is also desired since provision is made for the cutting module with the sliding rings to be mounted in the sliding bearings with at least 0.2 Nm, but with at most 5 Nm. The sliding rings are pressed onto the cutting module by force fit; furthermore, the cutting module is intended to have a multipart design, particularly in the proximal region which is inserted into the hand-held module. A further idea of the present invention relates to the embodiment of the distal end of the cutting module. Here, provision should be made for one section made of hardened flat-bar steel, which section also forms the blade. Here, this cutting element, which is formed from flat-bar steel, may, in one option, be arranged such that it radially encloses the cutting module or it is inserted into the cutting module. Furthermore, it can also be placed directly against the cutting module in the manner of a butt joint. A valve unit is preferably inserted into the hand-held module at the end opposite the cutting module. Said valve unit can be connected to the hand-held module by means of a bayonet-like connection. Situated within the valve unit is a valve, which allows the insertion of a further medical instrument, but surrounds this instrument in a manner that is as airtight as possible.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates in general to pillows and more specifically to a pillow structure having a cavity in the pillow structure and openings from the outside of the structure to the cavity so that users can rest face-down on the structure and place their hands and arms into the structure and be able to view an item placed into a cavity in the middle of the pillow structure through the opening for their face. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION There are many bedding products, including mattresses and pillows designed to increase a user&#39;s comfort while lying down to sleep or rest or perform sedentary activities. Some major concerns for people lying down or sleeping are related to breathing, pressure, stress, alignment, and overall comfort. These concerns can be greater for overweight or taller users, athletic users, and pregnant women. Most pillows are designed to provide support for the user&#39;s head and neck while the user lays down on their back or side. Some designs are created to keep the user&#39;s spine in alignment while the user sleeps on their side or back. These pillows may be designed with curves upward to provide further support in the area at the base of the skull for the user sleeping on their back or at the neck and jawline of the user sleeping on their side. Some pillows are manufactured out of special materials to provide support or flexibility and to contour to the user&#39;s unique shape. However, not all people prefer to lay down or sleep on their back or side, and the above mentioned specially designed pillows are not comfortable for a user who chooses to sleep on their front facing the pillow. Some people prefer to sleep or rest face-down to increase their comfort and alleviate their concern with breathing, loss of circulation, and pressure. For example, some people sleep face down because they are uncomfortable sleeping on their back due to breathing problems, such as a closing of their airway or sleep apnea. Some people sleep face down because they find that sleeping on their side will cause their arms to fall asleep or their spine to feel misaligned. Many people toss and turn throughout the night trying to get comfortable or reposition their body to relieve some stress on their arms, hips, neck, head, and back. Sleeping face-down on a standard pillow can cause issues with airflow, breathing, and temperature control. Sleeping facing down can also cause problems with blood circulation in the arms if the arms are pressed under the body. It can also cause breathing problems or issues with air flow or circulation when the user is facing the pillow. Further, issues with temperature control can be caused by breathing into a pillow pressed against the user&#39;s face. Some users turn their head sideways when sleeping face-down to increase airflow and temperature control. This can cause a strain on the user&#39;s neck, arms, and back if the user turns their head to sleep with their current pillows. Pillows have been designed to help provide a place for an adult&#39;s face to lay, or a hole, which allows room for the user to breathe, for example U.S. Design Pat. No. D277,059 (Boone). Some users take stress off their neck when they sleep on their front by placing their arms or hands under the pillow to prop the pillow up to. This can cause a loss of blood circulation to the arms or hands with their arm placed under the pressure of the body, head, or pillow. One attempt to solve this problem of creating space under a pillow, is U.S. Pat. No. 3,883,906 (Sumpter), which provides tunnel-like openings for the arms of a sleeper. Sumpter provides that the user&#39;s arms would be extended above the user&#39;s head and parallel to their body underneath the pillow. The problems described above also occur when the user tries to perform sedentary tasks when resting on their front facing a pillow structure. For example, users seek a comfortable way to perform sedentary tasks, such as reading email or typing on an electronic device, reading books, or performing tasks on their mobile devices, cell phones, or tablets while resting. These tasks can include many different tasks on various devices or objects, such as reading and writing emails and text messages; watching videos, such as sports, movies and television shows; surfing the internet; reading the news and gossip; shopping online; and other tasks requiring limited ability to move. With the proliferation of smaller devices capable of performing these tasks and other tasks, people are more likely to perform these tasks on a smaller device and at various locations. Although these tasks may take place while the user is seated, such as on an airplane, or at a desk, or at a table, these tasks may alternately take place while the user is leaning forward while seated or while the user is lying down. Many people perform these tasks in bed. Some people are not comfortable lying on their back while holding a book or mobile device, cell phone, or tablet above them for an extended period of time. Holding an object above your face for an extended period of time can be uncomfortable. Some people are not comfortable lying on their side for an extended period of time holding a book or device. Lying on one&#39;s side limits the ability of one arm or hand to hold the book and turn the page or to touch the device. Further, many new devices contain technology that automatically turns the image on the device based on how the device is oriented, assuming the user is not lying sideways, so that a user reading a website or looking at a picture or video with their head turned sideways must awkwardly turn (or change the settings on their device). Another problem people have is trying to rest or perform sedentary activities comfortably while seated. This is particularly the case while users are seated on an airplane or at a desk or table. Some pillows have been designed to help support the user&#39;s head and neck, but these do not provide the desired amount of support or stability. Some users lean forward and cross their arms and rest their head against their arms, turning their head to the side. This position allows for some level of comfort if the user can comfortably do so while bending at the waist. In many locations, bending at the waist is not a comfortable option, including on an airplane. Also, by turning their head, the user&#39;s spine is not aligned. Some users lean their head to the side or try to keep their head back against a headrest, but during their rest their head may lean forward or to a different side if not given the desired support. Leaning the head to the side for too long will also cause pain, stiffness, or soreness for the user&#39;s neck. By turning their head, the user&#39;s spine is not aligned and the user cannot comfortably rest or sleep. Based on the restricted size of seats, leg space, and lap space for user&#39;s sitting on airplanes, users seek a comfortable alternative to the available options. Users are particularly sedentary on airplanes, but the inventive pillow structure would be similarly useful for users seated at a desk or table. Another problem people have while lying down is comfortably listening to audio through headphones. Some people listen to music, books “on tape,” audio with video, or other sounds such as “white noise” while resting. People place headphones over their ears or place earbuds into their ears while leaning forward in a seated position or while lying down. Many headphones that cover the user&#39;s ears or earbuds inserted into the ear are not comfortable when the user&#39;s head is against a pillow or against the user&#39;s arm or another object. Pressure from an object against the headphones or earbuds, even from a relatively soft object such as a pillow, can cause discomfort to the user. Designing a comfortable pillow structure that allows the user to rest facing down towards a pillow structure, while the user&#39;s arms and/or hands are comfortably placed underneath the user&#39;s head at an angle substantially perpendicular to the user&#39;s body would be a useful invention as it would allow the user to rest comfortably and position their arms in a manner that allowed flexibility in the user&#39;s movements and allow the user to perform sedentary activities. Designing a pillow structure with a cavity in the middle of the pillow structure for the user to place an object such as a book or device, and providing at least one opening for the user&#39;s face and at least two openings for the user&#39;s arms and/or hands that meet at the cavity would be a useful invention allowing the user to perform sedentary activities while comfortably resting. Designing a pillow structure with space in at least one opening to the cavity for wires, power cords, or headphones or earbuds would be a useful invention. Designing a pillow structure with a source of light for viewing objects placed in the cavity in the middle of the pillow structure the would be a useful invention. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention features a pillow structure for the user to rest facing down toward the pillow structure. The pillow structure has a top surface, at least two sides, a bottom, and a cavity in the middle of the pillow structure. The inventive pillow structure has a cavity in the middle of the structure, at least one opening located substantially on the top of the pillow structure for the user&#39;s face, at least two side openings in the sides of the pillow structure for the user&#39;s hands and arms to be placed within the cavity. The inventive pillow&#39;s cavity can be accessed from the outside of the pillow from the at least one opening on the top surface and from the at least two openings on the sides. The cavity may also be accessed from other openings of the pillow structure. All these openings may increase air flow and may provide a space for a light source and power source. Any opening may be large enough for the insertion of useful objects or devices into the pillow structure, such as wires, cords, and headphones to extend through the openings into the cavity.",

    "abstract": "The present invention pertains generally to methods for performing intrastromal ophthalmic laser surgery. More particularly, the present invention pertains to laser surgery wherein stromal tissue is cut on concentric cylindrical surfaces, with the surfaces being oriented parallel to, and centered on, the visual axis of an eye. The present invention is particularly, but not exclusively, useful as a method for performing intrastromal ophthalmic laser surgery wherein reshaping of the cornea is accomplished by inducing a redistribution of bio-mechanical forces in the cornea. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The cornea of an eye has five (5) different identifiable layers of tissue. Proceeding in a posterior direction from the anterior surface of the cornea, these layers are: the epithelium; Bowman&#39;s capsule (membrane); the stroma; Descemet&#39;s membrane; and the endothelium. Behind the cornea is an aqueous-containing space called the anterior chamber. Importantly, pressure from the aqueous in the anterior chamber acts on the cornea with bio-mechanical consequences. Specifically, the aqueous in the anterior chamber of the eye exerts an intraocular pressure against the cornea. This creates stresses and strains that place the cornea under tension. Structurally, the cornea of the eye has a thickness (T), that extends between the epithelium and the endothelium. Typically, “T” is approximately five hundred microns (T=500 μm). From a bio-mechanical perspective, Bowman&#39;s capsule and the stroma are the most important layers of the cornea. Within the cornea, Bowman&#39;s capsule is a relatively thin layer (e.g. 20 to 30 μm) that is located below the epithelium, within the anterior one hundred microns of the cornea. The stroma then comprises almost all of the remaining four hundred microns in the cornea. Further, the tissue of Bowman&#39;s capsule creates a relatively strong, elastic membrane that effectively resists forces in tension. On the other hand, the stroma comprises relatively weak connective tissue. Bio-mechanically, Bowman&#39;s capsule and the stroma are both significantly influenced by the intraocular pressure that is exerted against the cornea by aqueous in the anterior chamber. In particular, this pressure is transferred from the anterior chamber, and through the stroma, to Bowman&#39;s membrane. It is known that how these forces are transmitted through the stroma will affect the shape of the cornea. Thus, by disrupting forces between interconnective tissue in the stroma, the overall force distribution in the cornea can be altered. Consequently, this altered force distribution will then act against Bowman&#39;s capsule. In response, the shape of Bowman&#39;s capsule is changed, and due to the elasticity and strength of Bowman&#39;s capsule, this change will directly influence the shape of the cornea. With this in mind, and as intended for the present invention, refractive surgery is accomplished by making cuts on predetermined surfaces in the stroma to induce a redistribution of bio-mechanical forces that will reshape the cornea. It is well known that all of the different tissues of the cornea are susceptible to Laser Induced Optical Breakdown (LIOB). Further, it is known that different tissues will respond differently to a laser beam, and that the orientation of tissue being subjected to LIOB may also affect how the tissue reacts to LIOB. With this in mind, the stroma needs to be specifically considered. The stroma essentially comprises many lamellae that extend substantially parallel to the anterior surface of the eye. In the stroma, the lamellae are bonded together by a glue-like tissue that is inherently weaker than the lamellae themselves. Consequently, LIOB over layers parallel to the lamellae can be performed with less energy (e.g. 0.8 μJ) than the energy required for the LIOB over cuts that are oriented perpendicular to the lamellae (e.g. 1.2 μJ). It will be appreciated by the skilled artisan, however, that these energy levels are only exemplary. If tighter focusing optics can be used, the required energy levels will be appropriately lower. In any event, depending on the desired result, it may be desirable to make only cuts in the stroma. On the other hand, for some procedures it may be more desirable to make a combination of cuts and layers. In light of the above, it is an object of the present invention to provide methods for performing ophthalmic laser surgery that result in reshaping the cornea to achieve refractive corrections for improvement of a patient&#39;s vision. Another object of the present invention is to provide methods for performing ophthalmic laser surgery that require minimal LIOB of stromal tissue. Still another object of the present invention is to provide methods for performing ophthalmic laser surgery that avoid compromising Bowman&#39;s capsule and, instead, maintain it intact for use in providing structural support for a reshaped cornea. Yet another object of the present invention is to provide methods for performing ophthalmic laser surgery that are relatively easy to implement and comparatively cost effective. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In accordance with the present invention, methods for performing intrastromal ophthalmic laser surgery are provided that cause the cornea to be reshaped under the influence of bio-mechanical forces. Importantly, for these methods, a tissue volume for operation is defined that is located solely within the stroma of the cornea. Specifically, this operational volume extends posteriorly from slightly below Bowman&#39;s capsule (membrane) to a substantial depth into the stroma that is equal to approximately nine tenths of the thickness of the cornea. Thus, with the cornea having a thickness “T” (e.g. approximately 500 μm), the operational volume extends from below Bowman&#39;s capsule (e.g. 100 μm) to a depth in the cornea that is equal to approximately 0.9 T (e.g. approximately 450 μm). Further, the operational volume extends radially from the visual axis of the eye through a distance of about 5.0 mm (i.e. the operational volume has a diameter of around 10.0 mm). In general, each method of the present invention requires the use of a laser unit that is capable of generating a so-called femtosecond laser beam. Stated differently, the duration of each pulse in the beam will approximately be less than one picosecond. When generated, this beam is directed and focused onto a series of focal spots in the stroma. The well-known result of this is a Laser Induced Optical Breakdown (LIOB) of stromal tissue at each focal spot. In particular, and as intended for the present invention, movement of the focal spot in the stroma creates a plurality of cuts, with each cut being made on portions of a respective cylindrical surface. Geometrically, the respective cylindrical surfaces on which cuts are made are concentric, and they are centered on the visual axis of the eye. And, they can be circular cylinders or oval (elliptical) cylinders. Further each cylindrical surface has an anterior end and a posterior end. To maintain the location of the cylindrical surface within the operational volume, the posterior end of the cut is located no deeper in the stroma than approximately 0.9 T from the anterior surface of the eye. On the other hand, the anterior end of the cylindrical cut is located in the stroma more than at least eight microns in a posterior direction from Bowman&#39;s capsule. These “cuts” will each have a thickness of about two microns. In a preferred procedure, each cut is approximately two hundred microns from an adjacent cut, and the innermost cut (i.e. center cut) may be located about 1.0 millimeters from the visual axis. There can, of course be many such cylindrical cuts (preferably five), and they can each define a substantially complete cylindrical shaped wall. Such an arrangement may be particularly well suited for the treatment of presbyopia. In a variant of this procedure that would be more appropriate for the treatment of astigmatism, portions of the cylindrical surfaces subjected to LIOB can define diametrically opposed arc segments. In this case each arc segment preferably extends through an arc that is in a range between five degrees and one hundred and sixty degrees. Insofar as the cuts are concerned, each pulse of the laser beam that is used for making the cut has an energy of approximately 1.2 microJoules or, perhaps, less (e.g. 1.0 microJoules). For additional variations in the methods of the present invention, in addition to or instead of the cuts mentioned above, differently configured layers of LIOB can be created in the stromal tissue of the operational volume. To create these layers, LIOB is performed in all, or portions, of an annular shaped area. Further, each layer will lie in a plane that is substantially perpendicular to the visual axis of the eye. For purposes of the present invention the layers are distanced approximately ten microns from each adjacent layer, and each layer will have an inner diameter “d i ”, and an outer diameter “d o ”. These “layers” will have a thickness of about one micron. As indicated above, the present invention envisions creating a plurality of such layers adjacent to each other, inside the operational volume. In yet another variation of the present invention, “radial cuts” can be made in the stroma. Specifically, the radial cuts will be located at a predetermined azimuthal angle θ and will be substantially coplanar with the visual axis of the eye. Each radial cut will be in the operational volume described above and will extend outwardly from the visual axis from an inside radius “r i ” to an outside radius “r o ”. Further, there may be as many “radial cuts” as desired, with each “radial cut” having its own specific azimuthal angle θ. As intended for the present invention, all “cuts” and “layers” (i.e. the cylindrical cuts, the annular layers, and the radial cuts) will weaken stromal tissue, and thereby cause a redistribution of bio-mechanical forces in the stroma. Specifically, weaknesses in the stroma that result from the LIOB of “cuts” and “layers” will respectively cause the stroma to “bulge” or “flatten” in response to the intraocular pressure from the anterior chamber. As noted above, however, these changes will be somewhat restrained by Bowman&#39;s capsule. The benefit of this restraint is that the integrity of the cornea is maintained. Note: in areas where layers are created, there can be a rebound of the cornea that eventually results in a slight bulge being formed. Regardless, with proper prior planning, the entire cornea can be bio-mechanically reshaped, as desired. With the above in mind, it is clear the physical consequences of making “cuts” or “layers” in the stroma are somewhat different. Although they will both weaken the stroma, to thereby allow intraocular pressure from aqueous in the anterior chamber to reshape the cornea, “cuts” (i.e. LIOB parallel and radial to the visual axis) will cause the cornea to bulge. On the other hand, “layers” (i.e. LIOB perpendicular to the visual axis) will tend to flatten the cornea. In any event. “cuts,” alone, or a combination of “cuts” with “layers” can be used to reshape the cornea with only an insignificant amount of tissue removal. In accordance with the present invention, various procedures can be customized to treat identifiable refractive imperfections. Specifically, in addition to cuts alone, the present invention contemplates using various combinations of cuts and layers. In each instance, the selection of cuts, or cuts and layers, will depend on how the cornea needs to be reshaped. Also, in each case it is of utmost importance that the cuts and layers be centered on the visual axis (i.e. there must be centration). Some examples are: Presbyopia: Cylindrical cuts only need be used for this procedure.",

    "abstract": "The present invention generally relates to an exercise device. More particularly, the present invention pertains to a multi-use elastic exercise device for use in suspension exercises, stretching and resistance training. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Suspension exercise devices have long been incorporated into athletic training and therapeutic regimens as an avenue for fitness training, targeted muscle building and muscle therapy, and rehabilitation without the cost and space required with more bulky equipment. In particular, many types of devices and systems have been proposed that leverage gravity and a user&#39;s own bodyweight for stretching or performing a wide variety of exercises. Some of these systems rely on rigid straps anchored to a door or a ceiling hook, for example, wherein a user grasps handles provided at respective ends of the straps and leans their body at a chosen angle to do exercises. Changing the body angle relative to the floor or a wall, for example, changes the amount of a user&#39;s own bodyweight being held in suspension by the straps. Exercises may thus be made more or less demanding in accordance. Other systems rely on complex combinations of rigid and elastic components to provide varying degrees resistance and support during suspension training. However, all of these systems require constant reconfiguring, such as adding coupling components, adjusting or changing the position of straps and/or anchor points, and/or adding or changing the position of the handles, for example, to set up for exercise and/or for changing or easily establishing different points of leverage to change the difficulty of an exercise performed using the exercise device. There is a need for a suspension exercise device configured for easy and efficient set up and use that does not require the need to reconfigure the device in order to change the difficulty of the device during use. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The foregoing needs are met, to a great extent, by the present invention, wherein in some embodiments an exercise device that is capable of overcoming the disadvantages described herein is provided. According to certain aspects of the present disclosure, an exercise device includes a first strap portion having a first elongate portion and a second elongate portion joined together along a common longitudinal axis at varying points to define a first plurality of loops, a second strap portion having a third elongate portion and a fourth elongate portion joined together along a second common longitudinal axis at varying points to define a second plurality of loops, and an anchoring device. The first strap portion and the second strap portion may be coupled to one another, and the anchoring device may hold or secure the coupled first and second strap portions such that the first plurality of loops and the second plurality of loops extend substantially symmetrically away from the anchoring device. According to yet other aspects of the present disclosure, a suspension exercise device includes a strap having a plurality of loops and an anchor device for securing the strap to a stationary support, wherein a load applied on one of the loops moves the loop away from the anchor device until a controlled deceleration actuated by the strap prevents further movement of the loop beyond an end point. There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, certain embodiments of the invention in order that the detailed description herein may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are, of course, additional embodiments of the invention that will be described below and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto. In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of embodiments in addition to those described and of being practiced and carried out in various ways. Also, it is to be understood that the phraseology and terminology employed herein, as well as the abstract, are for the purpose of description and should not be regarded as limiting.

    "abstract": "This invention relates to the treatment of impotence comprising co-administering (1) a potassium channel opener and (2) a compound which elevates cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cGMP) levels. The combination is particularly suitable for the treatment of patients suffering from impotence or erectile dysfunction. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Impotence is the inability to obtain and/or sustain an erection sufficient for penetration of the vagina and/or intercourse. Thus, impotence is also referred to as “erectile insufficiency” or “erectile dysfunction”. It has been estimated that 10-12 million American men between the ages of 18 and 75 suffer from chronic impotence, with the great majority being over age 55. The penis normally becomes erect when certain tissues, in particular the corpora cavernosa in the central portion of the penis, become engorged with blood, thereby causing them to become less flaccid, and in turn causing an erection. Impotence can result from psychologic disturbances (psychogenic), from physiologic abnormalities (organic) or from a combination of both. Thus, in some males erectile dysfunction may be due to anxiety or depression, with no apparent somatic or organic impairment. In other cases, erectile dysfunction is associated with atherosclerosis of the arteries supplying blood to the penis. In still other cases, the dysfunction may be due to venous leakage or abnormal drainage in which there is leakage from veins in the penis such that sufficient pressure for an erection can be neither obtained nor maintained. In still other cases, the dysfunction is associated with a neuropathy or due to nerve damage arising from, for example, surgery or a pelvic injury. Typically, multiple factors are responsible for impotence. Pharmacological, biophysical and molecular studies have revealed multiple subtypes for membrane ion channels that form potassium selective pores in the plasma membrane of many mammalian cells. One can classify the family of K channels simply by their respective gating properties. In other words, a comparison of the pharmacological and electrophysiological properties of potassium channels has given rise to an operational definition for grouping the various subtypes based largely on their gating properties. At present, potassium channels of known amino acid sequence comprise two distantly related protein families. One of these channel families is termed, “voltage-gated,” the other channel family is termed “inward rectifying.” The structure of the voltage-gated channel protein is known to be comprised of six membrane spanning domains in each subunit, each of which is regulated by changes in membrane potential. B. Hille, “Ionic Channels of Excitable Membranes” (Sinauer, Sunderland, Mass., 1992). Voltage-gated potassium channels sense changes in membrane potential and move potassium ions in response to this alteration in the cell membrane potential. Molecular cloning studies on potassium channel proteins has yielded information primarily for members of the voltage-gated family of potassium channels. Various genes encoding these voltage-gated family of potassium channel proteins have been cloned using Drosophila genes derived from both the Shaker, Shaw and Shab loci; Wei, A. et. al., Science (1990) Vol. 248 pp. 599-603. Unlike the voltage-gated channel proteins with six membrane spanning regions,the inward rectifier channels have only two membrane spanning domains, each sensitive to changes in the net potassium concentration. Within this class of channels are the ATP-sensitive potassium channels. These channels are classified by their sensitivity to concentration fluxes in ATP. The ATP-sensitive, or ATP-gated, potassium channel is an important class of channels that links the bioenergetic situation of the cell to changes in cell function. These channels are blocked by high intracellular ATP concentrations and are open when ATP decreases. Lazdunski (1992); M. Lazdunski et al., “ATP-Sensitive K&lt;+&gt; Channels”, Renal Physiol. Biochem. Vol. 17: pp. 118-120 (1994). Although ATP-gated potassium channels were originally described in cardiac tissue, Noma, A. Nature (1983) Vol. 305 pp. 147-148, they have subsequently been described in pancreatic beta-cells, Cook et. al., Nature (1984) Vol. 311 pp. 271-273, vascular smooth muscle, Nelson, M. T. et. al., Am. J. Physiol. (1990) Vol. 259 pp. C3-C18 and in the thick ascending limb of the kidney, Wang, W. et. al. Am. J. Physiol. (1990) Vol. 258, pp. F244-F-253. The ATP-sensitive or ATP-gated potassium channels play an important role in human physiology. The ATP-sensitive potassium channel, like other potassium channels, selectively regulate the cell&#39;s permeability to potassium ions. These channels function to regulate the contraction and relaxation of the smooth muscle by opening or closing the channels in response to the modulation of receptors or potentials on the cell membrane. When ATP-sensitive potassium channels are opened, the increased permeability of the cell membrane allows more potassium ions to migrate outwardly so that the membrane potential shifts toward more negative values. When the membrane potential shifts toward more negative values the opening of the voltage-dependent calcium channels is reduced, this reduces the influx of calcium ions into the cell because the calcium channels become “increasingly less open” as the membrane potential becomes more negative. Consequently, drugs having ATP-sensitive potassium channel opening activity, drugs known as potassium channel openers, can relax vascular smooth muscle and are useful as hypotensive and coronary vasodilating agents. A relatively large number of compounds are now known which open cell membrane ATP-sensitive potassium channels, particularly in smooth muscle: minoxidil sulfate, diazoxide and nicorandil are well known potassium channel openers. The target site for these agents is presumably on the potassium channel itself, but may also be on an associated regulatory protein. Potassium channel openers represent a widely diverse series of compounds which all have the reported effect of opening only a subset of channels described as sensitive to ATP. As explained above, these compounds cause physiological responses by increasing membrane permeability to potassium, this leads to hyperpolarization of the cell membrane and temporal desensitization to electrical and chemical stimuli. Openers which target these channels have been synthesized as possible drugs in hypertension, angina pectoris, coronary heart disease, asthma, and urinary incontinence. There are various references which describe potassium channel openers: Cook et al., “Potassium Channels: Structure, Classification, Function and TherapeuticPotential”, ed. N. S.

Agents which elevate cGMP levels are also well known and can work through any of several mechanisms. Agents which selectively inhibit an enzyme predominantly involved in cGMP breakdown, for example a cGMP phosphodiesterase (cGMP PDE), constitute one example. Other phosphodiesterases can also hydrolyze cGMP, and inhibitors of these enzymes including compounds such as rolipram, zaprinast and xanthine derivatives such as caffeine, theophylline and theobromine, can accordingly influence cGMP levels. Other compounds which increase cGMP levels can do so through different mechanisms including the activation of soluble guanylate cyclase or membrane-bound guanylate cyclase, either directly as in the case of atrial natriuretic peptide, or indirectly. Other compounds act to increase cellular cGMP levels by modulation of cytokines. Other classes of cGMP elevators include muscarinic agonists, which can elevate cGMP levels without altering phosphodiesterase activity. Some prostaglandins such as PGE 1  are also known cGMP elevators. Kanba et. al., J. Neurochem., Vol. 57, No. 6,1991.",

    "abstract": "The invention relates to pharmaceutical drug compositions and preparations of lorazepam. This invention also relates to pharmaceutical drug delivery devices, specifically to devices for the intranasal administration of lorazepam. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Lorazepam preparations for the treatment of anxiety-related disorders and to induce sedation have been previously approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and have been long-used for oral, intramuscular and/or intravenous administration. Lorazepam is currently marketed in injectable and tablet formulations. Marketers of these preparations have not sought regulatory approval from the FDA for liquid compositions of the same therapeutic compound for intranasal administration. This is surprising since it is well-known from the literature that the intranasal administration of a pharmacologically active compound generally results in a more rapid bioavailability of the compound, or of its desired active metabolite than if the compound is administered orally. Moreover, the time required to achieve the same concentration of the active compound in the bloodstream e.g., within a period of about thirty minutes after administration, is generally less via the intranasal route compared to oral administration. It has been reported that, following oral administration, peak plasma concentrations of approximately 25 ng/mL were not observed until approximately 2.4 hours after administration with a bioavailability of 99.8%. (Greenblat, et al.,  Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences,  Vol. 66, No. 1 (1979).) It has also been reported that, following intranasal administration of lorazepam in a Cremophor EL, a non-aqueous vehicle, the time to peak plasma concentration was 1.4 hours with a bioavailability of 51%. (Lau and Slattery,  International Journal of Pharmaceuticals,  54 (1989) 171-174.) The intranasal route of administration also provides numerous advantages over intravenous (IV) and intramuscular (IM) injections. One principal advantage of intranasal administration is convenience. An injectable system requires sterilization of the hypodermic syringe and in the institutional setting, leads to concerns among medical personnel about the risk of contracting disease if the they are accidentally stuck by a contaminated needle. Strict requirements for the safe disposal of the used needle and syringe must also be imposed in the institutional setting. In contrast, intranasal administration requires little time on the part of the patient and the attending medical personnel, and is far less burdensome on the institution than injectables. There is no significant risk of infection of medical personnel or others in the institutional setting that is associated with nasal spray devices. A second important advantage of intranasal administration over IM and IV is patient acceptance of the drug delivery system. Many, if not most, patients experience anxiety and exhibit symptoms of stress when faced with hypodermic injections via the IM or IV routes. In some cases, the after-effects of the injection include burning, edema, swelling, turgidity, hardness and soreness. In contrast, intranasal administration is perceived as non-invasive, is not accompanied by pain, has no significant after-effects and produces the gratification of prompt relief in the patient exhibiting the symptom. This is of particular advantage when the patient is a child. Most people have some familiarity with nasal sprays in the form of over-the-counter decongestants for alleviating the symptoms of colds and allergies that they or a family member have used routinely. Another important consideration is that the patient can self-administer the prescribed dosage(s) of nasal spray. An empty nasal spray device, or one containing a non-medicated solution can be given to the patient to practice the technique for proper insertion, inhalation and activation for self-administration. In view of the aforementioned advantages and benefits afforded by the intranasal administration, it would be expected that a preparation of lorazepam exhibiting systemic pharmacological activity would presently be available for intranasal administration. This has not occurred, despite the fact that preparations for oral, IM and IV administration have been approved for commercial use for many years. Despite the remarkable commercial success that has been enjoyed by those drugs that have been made available in intranasal form, in fact, only a very limited number of compounds are commercially available to physicians to prescribe and dispense to their patients in that form. Furthermore, only one multiple-dose spray device has apparently been approved by the FDA for intranasal administration of an opiate solution that is categorized as a controlled substance. The devices that are presently available exhibit several deficiencies. One spray device intended for multiple uses must be primed before use by expelling a portion of the liquid contents in order to assure that the pump mechanism and delivery tube are filled. Up to seven or eight activations are required to prime the device. It is also indicated that further priming to disperse one or two sprays is to be performed if the device is not used for 48 hours or longer. These procedures necessarily result in the dispenser being overfilled in order to assure that there will be sufficient liquid to deliver the labelled number of doses. It has been found that a substantial volume of the controlled substance often remains in the device, even after the labelled number of doses have been administered. In practice, it has also been found that medical personnel and workers at health care facilities routinely abscond with the dispensers, sometimes after the patient has had only one or a few of the prescribed doses in a multi-dose container. This improper use of controlled substances as so-called “recreational drugs” is well-known among medical facility managers and law enforcement authorities. So far as is presently known, no preventative measures have been reported that are effective in dealing with this problem. A further problem resides in dispensing to a patient intranasal spray devices with sufficient fluid contents for numerous doses for anxiety control purposes. Because a patient suffering from a disorder and exhibiting anxiety may not act rationally in self-administering a drug for relief of the symptom, there is a potential for overdosing. Moreover, because of the nature and construction of these multiple dose spray devices, medical personnel cannot easily determine the number of doses that have been administered by a simple visual inspection of the device. Another problem that has recently been identified in clinical studies is the relative inaccuracy of multi-dose intranasal delivery devices that are currently being marketed with opiate solutions for the control of pain. Not only does the average volume of liquid spray actually administered fall about 10% below the purported dosage appearing on the approved label for one such product, significant variations were also observed among a series of administrations by each patient in the study group. Thus, spray devices tested containing an opiate compound classed as a “controlled substance” by the FDA were found to be capable of administering only about 90% by volume of the prescribed dosage, on average, and the dosage actually received by each patient in repeated administrations exhibited substantial significant variations of from 60% to 130% of the claimed label dosage. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, it is a principal object of the invention to provide a novel therapeutic composition of lorazepam and its pharmaceutical by acceptable derivatives for intranasal administration of at least one predetermined volumetric unit dose in the form of a spray by means that delivers one or more therapeutically prescribed unit doses that are highly accurate as to the volume discharged and which leave no significant quantity of the composition in the delivery means. Another object of the invention is to provide a novel composition comprising lorazepam, a known compound that is approved for oral, IM and/or IV administration, for use in a highly accurate and reproducible intranasal spray delivery system in a single unit-dose or therapeutically prescribed multiple unit-dose. It is a further object of this invention to provide an improved intranasal dosage composition and method of administration of lorazepam that exhibits a relatively rapid onset, moderate duration of therapeutic activity, minimal side effects, improved bioavailability, ease and safety of administration, and minimal physical discomfort and anxiety to the patient occasioned by administration. It is another object of this invention to provide an intranasal delivery system for one or more unit doses of novel therapeutic compositions containing lorazepam that permits administration of one or more therapeutically prescribed unit-doses in a medical care facility, such as a hospital, day clinic, or doctor or dentist&#39;s office in which the delivery system contains essentially no significant quantity of the therapeutic composition after administration of the single unit-dose or the prescribed number of multiple unit-doses. It is also an object of the invention to provide the novel and improved combination of a device for intranasal administration and a formulation for lorazepam that meet the requirements for FDA approval. Yet another object of the invention is to provide such novel lorazepam compositions for intranasal administration in a relatively small and inexpensive, manually operated, self-contained hand-held disposable device that retains essentially no significant quantity of the therapeutic composition after administration of the one or more unit-doses as prescribed. A further object of the invention is to provide a comprehensive method for providing a novel therapeutic composition for intranasal administration that contains lorazepam in a form that exhibits the same pharmacological activity as lorazepam compositions that are approved for oral, IM and/or IV administration, the intranasal composition being available for delivery in highly accurate and reproducible predetermined unit-doses leaving essentially no significant quantity of the therapeutic composition after administration of the prescribed number of unit-doses.",

This operation is accomplished in one trip across the field. It has been my experience that certain problems are encountered in an implement of this character wherein all of the operating components thereof are hydraulically selectively operable and wherein a tiller of any suitable type is pushed by means of the motive power unit and wherein lifting and lowering means is provided for the tiller. One of these problems has been solved in the following manner. The motor which furnishes the hydraulic power for the various operating components and for driving the entire farm implement also provides the power for driving the tiller and since the drive shaft from the motor to the tiller must be in proper alignment, regardless of the position of the tiller, the motor is bedded on a rocking or pivoting cradle to accommodate the lifted and lowered positions of the tiller. The motive power unit which pushed the tiller and tows the planter is mounted on and driven by four wheels, and each wheel is independently driven by means of a hydraulic motor operatively connected to and operating directly on the wheel which insures a direct drive. The independent operation of each wheel is controlled by the operator of the implement. Each wheel is steerable by hydraulic means controlled by the operator and the rear wheels of the four wheels for the motive power unit are suspended from the chassis of the motive power unit in such a manner that they may rock on a horizontal and longitudinally extending axis to accommodate uneveness in the terrain over which the implement is traveling. Since the operator will have complete control of the actuating means for each wheel, it will be appreciated that if one of the wheels of the four drive wheels spins in a mud hole or the like, the actuating hydraulic power to that wheel may be cut off. Means is provided for centering of the two rear wheels if separate steering is not desired, as for instance when the implement is traveling over a road. The operator of the implement is thereby assured that the rear wheels are centered without having to check a gauge. Thus, there is no manual operation required to center the rear wheels. It will be recognized that the operator of the implement has complete control from his operating position in the cab of all of the components which are hydraulically actuated, and I have provided a hydraulic circuit for the steering system and the drive system and these are independently operable. Additionally, this implement includes scarifier means actuable by the operator for the soil which may have been tamped down by the wheels of the motive power unit.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to milking machines and more specifically to the short milk tube ferrule on the milking claw portion of the milking unit. 2. Setting of the Invention A major problem for milk producers and regulatory agencies has been the milk residue and other deposits which collect on the interior of the short milk tubes between the teatcup assembly and the claw mechanism. One particular area which is most troublesome is the area between the ferrule of the milking claw and the short milk tube, which is placed some distance over the end of the ferrule. Milk, dirt, debris and microorganisms may collect in this area and remain after washing and sanitizing. The area of contamination is posterior to the ferrule opening, in the overlap between the inside wall of the short milk tube and the outside wall of the ferrule itself. FIGS. 20, 21, and 22 show a prior an form of a ferrule with the contaminated area stippled. This residue will frequently contaminate any milk which subsequently flows through the tubing when the milk phase is resumed. It is generally recognized that the annual loss in milk production due to contamination is very large. It is well documented that completely washing and sanitizing a milking unit of residual deposits of milk and debris is difficult. This is partly because contamination readily collect between the ferrule and tubing structures. Efforts have been made to develop improved techniques to wash and sanitize the milking units. These efforts include flushing with detergents and sanitizers, improved valve designs as well as alterations in the structure of the milking unit. However, none of the design changes or cleaning methods have been successful in completely washing and sanitizing the space between the short milk tubes and the ferrules. Repetitive milking inevitably causes the formation of a pocket between the ferrule and short milk tube. A pocket develops in almost all designs which utilize a ferrule on the milking claw. This condition is exacerbated by the following: 1. The bending of the short milk tubes over the ferrule when they are inverted from non-milking to milking orientation during the process of attachment. 2. The natural bending of the short milk tubes over the ferrules as the milking unit is in the actual process of milking. 3. The bending of the short milk tubes over the ferrule when they are inverted from milking orientation to the washing and sanitizing orientation. Since automated washing has not been effective to completely clean the short milk tubes due to the existence of the pockets between the tubes and the ferrules, the only way to remove milk and debris from the pockets is by manual disassembly, cleaning, and reassembly of the short milk tube-ferrule combination. Because this manual cleaning is labor intensive and time consuming, in actuality, it is rarely performed. As a result, dairy producers may suffer financial penalties due to decrease in the quality of the milk. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, the principal object of the present invention is to provide a novel ferrule design which enables the milking unit to be completely washed and sanitized after each milking operation without manual disassembly. Another object is to provide a ferrule which enables the complete removal or flushing of milk and debris from the pockets which are formed between the short milk tubes and the ferrule of the milking claw. Another object of the invention is to provide a methodology to increase the quality of milk produced by the dairy industry. A still further object of the invention is to provide a methodology to prevent financial loss to the dairy producer as a result of lowering the quality of milk. A further object of the invention is to provide a novel ferrule, designed to reduce the necessity for manual disassembly and cleaning after each milking. These and still further objects will become apparent hereinafter. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a simple and cost effective means for a more thorough washing and sanitizing of milking units and removing of debris from the short milk tube-ferrule pockets without the need for removal or replacement of the short milk tubes or teatcup assembly. An aperture is located near the tip of the ferrule of the milking claw, adjacent to the potentially contaminated pocket. This aperture particularly diverts the washing and sanitizing solutions toward and through the pocket during forward or reverse circulation. This turbulence aids in the removal of the contamination and allows a more thorough washing and sanitizing. It appears that the aperture causes a series of eddy currents formed by a divergence from laminar flow. Eddy current in this context means a series of circulating flow patterns. Such flow may be the result of the difference in pressure between the pressure in the short milk tube and the pressure in the collecting area of the claw; known as a venturi effect. The present invention consists of an improved milking claw ferrule, which is comprised of a tube-like body, attached at one end to a base, and having, at the other end, a main opening and an aperture. The aperture is designed to cause removal of debris from a pocket formed between the ferrule and the interior of the wall of the short milk tube.",

Cardiac output is obtained by multiplying the stroke volume by the heart rate. The invention utilizes pregelled spot electrodes to facilitate continuous monitoring of cardiac output. The invention is simple to operate in that the operator needs only to attach the electrodes to the patient, turn the power on, enter the thoracic dimensions into the system, and select the desired variable to be displayed and monitored. Cardiac output parameters are monitored by producing an electrical signal indicative of the thoracic impedance as a function of time and eliminating the effects of respiration from the thoracic impedance signal to produce a pulsatile impedance signal indicative of changes in thoracic impedance due to cardiovascular activity as a function of time. By electrically processing the thoracic impedance signal to eliminate the effects of respiration from the signal, the invention overcomes the deficiencies of prior art devices which require measurement of thoracic impedance during voluntary apnea. The electrical signal indicative of the pulsatile thoracic impedance is processed to determine the maximum rate of change of the pulsatile impedance signal. A microprocessor is programmed to use the thoracic base impedance, the ventricular ejection time, the maximum rate of change of pulsatile impedance, and the average distance between upper and lower sensing electrodes to produce signals indicative of stroke volume. The results of calculation can be digitally printed on a printer or may be displayed on a visual display to indicate the base thoracic impedance, the ventricular ejection time, the maximum rate of impedance change, the stroke volume, the heart rate, and the cardiac output.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a method for treating cancer, providing an increased therapeutic effect against cancer, which comprises administering an anticancer drug that uses α,α,α-trifluorothymidine (FTD) and a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (TPI) in combination. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION α,α,α-Trifluorothymidine (FTD, see the structural formula below) is a nucleoside analogue with substitution of a methyl group to trifluoromethyl group at the 5-position of thymidine, which was synthesized by Heidelberger et al. (J. Am. Chem. Soc., 84: 3597-3598, 1962; J. Med. Chem., 7: 1-5, 1964). Unlike a fluorouracil (FU)-based antitumor drug that are widely used for cancer patients, FTD has no effect on RNA, and is phosphorylated by an intracellular thymidine kinase to form a monophosphorylated form, namely, trifluorothymidine monophosphate (F 3 TMP). The F 3 TMP binds to a thymidylate synthase (TS) to exhibit a DNA synthesis-inhibiting effect (Biochemistry, 33: 15086-15094, 1994; Mol. Pharmacol., 1: 14-30, 1965). FU-based antitumor drug such as 5-FU that are clinically used as a representative antitumor drug have been reported to show a inhibition of TS activity as the main mechanism of action, while it has recently been reported that some patients are less sensitive to the FU-based antitumor agent (J. Clin. Oncol., 12: 2640-2647, 1994; Id. 14: 176-182, 1996; Id. 21: 815-819, 2003). The incorporation of FTD into DNA may represent an antitumor activity to FU less sensitive pacients by different mechanism of action from FU-based antitumor drug. Clinical trials of FTD were performed in 1970s, revealing the problem inherent in FTD that this drug is degraded by a thymidine phosphorylase (TP) in a human body after intravenous administration, resulting in the extremely shortened half-life thereof in the blood, i.e. approximately 12 minutes (Cancer Res., 32: 247-253, 1972). Further, although some tumor regressions were noted by divided doses every three hours, several problems have been also indicated that this means of administration lacks general usage, have showed adverse invent of the bone marrow supression and gastrointentinal toxicities, and have not necessarily been able to contribute to survival period even in some patients having tumor shrinkage (Cancer Chemother. Rep., 55: 205-208, 1971). Under the circumstances, the applicant has discovered 5-chloro-6-(1-(2-iminopyrrolidinyl)methyl)uracil hydrochloride (see the structural formula below), a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (TPI) for preventing FTD degradation, which enables the blood concentration of FTD to be maintained and the drug to be administered orally for improving the general usage, and has developed a anticancer drug (TAS-102) containing FTD and TPI in a molar ratio of 1:0.5 (Japanese Patent No. 3,088,757; International Journal of Oncology 25: 571-578, 2004).",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to fluid outlet ports for medical solution containers, such as containers for intravenous (IV) fluids to be administered to a patient, and particularly to fluid outlet ports having a pierceable diaphragm. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Containers for storage and administration of medical solutions are well known. Such containers are commonly referred to as partial additive bags or PABs. One such container is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,484,916 to McPhee, assigned to the present assignee. The container disclosed in the above-mentioned patent is formed of a plastic bag and a molded plastic header section. In the header section, there is an inlet port for admitting medication, nutrients, etc., into the bag, and an outlet port through which the bag&#39;s contents may be drawn for ultimate delivery to a patient. The outlet port is a hollow, substantially cylindrical structure sealed by an internal, pierceable diaphragm. Medication, typically in liquid form, is administered from the container to a patient through IV tubing coupled to the container by means of a filter spike. The combination of IV tubing and spike are  usually referred to as &#34;an administration set.&#34; The spike, usually formed of a hollow, cylindrical shaft terminated by a tapered tip, is pushed into the outlet port so that the tip pierces the diaphragm. As insertion continues, the spike&#39;s cylindrical shaft spreads the diaphragm open as it passes through. During insertion and thereafter, the diaphragm frictionally engages the spike, forming a seal between the diaphragm and the spike to prevent the loss of liquids or air from the bag around the spike&#39;s exterior. After the spike is fully inserted, the bag can be turned upside down with the outlet port on the bottom, so that the medical solution can pass through the hollow spike to the IV tubing and, ultimately, to the patient. Frictional engagement between the spike and diaphragm helps to secure the spike in the outlet port. It is conventional to form the pierceable diaphragm of the above-described outlet port in a plane normal to the axis of the port and, hence, normal to the insertion direction of the spike. However, it has been discovered that the force required to fully insert the spike increases sharply to an undesirably high level at the point where the cylindrical shaft of the spike engages the diaphragm. This sharp increase in resistance to pushing the spike through the diaphragm can be mistaken for the point of full insertion, so that the person discontinues the insertion process. When such a spike is not fully inserted, leakage can occur. Moreover, if insertion falls short of where the cylindrical portion of the spike&#39;s shaft fully engages and bears against the ruptured diaphragm, there is a danger that, when the container is suspended upside-down, the spike will slip out of the port, since a substantial part of the force retaining the spike in the port is due to the frictional engagement between spike and diaphragm. Incomplete spike penetration will thus result in waste of fluid, or even waste of the container, and possible contamination of the spike. These problems are exacerbated by the use of different-diameter spikes. Generally, the greater the diameter of the spike, the greater the penetration force required. Spikes normally range from 3/16-inch to 1/4-inch in diameter at the cylindrical portion, with the penetration force needed for the 1/4-inch spike being significantly greater than that for the 3/16-inch spike. One way to reduce the required penetration force is to decrease the thickness of the diaphragm or to weaken the material of the diaphragm, or both. However, this reduces the reliability of the seal created by the diaphragm and can reduce the retention force on a spike which has been inserted. Another way to reduce the insertion force is to increase the diameter of the outlet port with respect to the spike, but this also reduces the retention force. Accordingly, it is difficult to design a port whose diaphragm is more easily penetrable by a spike without also unacceptably reducing the force required to withdraw the spike from the port. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION There is, therefore, provided in accordance with practice of the present invention an outlet port for a medical liquid container which incorporates a pierceable diaphragm that is slanted at an angle to a normal to the insertion direction of a filter spike of an administration set, i.e., the diaphragm is slanted at an angle to a normal to the axial direction of the port. The force required to be exerted on the filter spike to penetrate such a slanted diaphragm is less than the force required to penetrate a diaphragm that is not slanted, while the force retaining the spike within the slanted diaphragm remains acceptably high. In one embodiment of the invention, the medical solution container is in the form of a collapsible bag incorporating inlet and an outlet ports. The outlet port has a tubular neck, wherein a substantially cylindrically-shaped channel communicates at one end with the inside of the collapsible bag. The other end of the channel is adapted to receive the filter spike. A pierceable diaphragm is disposed in the channel to provide a seal, which is broken as the spike is inserted into the channel and through the diaphragm. The pierceable diaphragm is disposed substantially in a plane at an angle to a normal to the insertion direction of the spike to provide for gradual engagement of the spike&#39;s cylindrical shaft with the diaphragm during insertion. Such gradual engagement avoids a sharp increase in the insertion force required to overcome the diaphragm&#39;s resistance to spreading. For a presently preferred diaphragm material, the preferred angle is from about 5° to about 20°, and is preferably about 15°.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to an implantable blood monitoring and medication delivery method in general and, more particularly, to an implantable blood glucose monitoring system with means for infusing insulin as determined by the glucose monitoring for the control of blood glucose levels in diabetic patients, all of which is performed by apparatus within the body. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Among the serious metabolic diseases, the most common is diabetes mellitus, which is commonly known as diabetes and affects many millions of people around the world. The disease is characterized by a defective pancreas. The pancreas is the gland which is responsible for the secretion of insulin which controls the blood glucose level. It produces digestive enzymes which are secreted into the duodenum where they digest and neutralize food passing from the stomach to the intestine. Diabetes mellitus or secondary diabetes stems from causes other than genetic defects, e.g., a destroyed pancreas. It results in hyperglycemia, which is excess glucose in the blood. It also results in excretable glucose in the urine and may lead to increased liver production of organic acids. The latter can result in coma and possible death. Hence, the need for continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels and the administration of insulin to control those levels. The most widely used method to control blood glucose level is a program of single, daily injections of insulin, and many patients have been taught to do this themselves. However, commercially available implantable pumps improve upon this method by injecting insulin, upon signal, into the blood stream several times a day in smaller doses. The pump is refilled with insulin once or twice a month by injection. This reduces the number of externally administered injections the patient must undergo and also allows preprogrammed variable amounts of insulin to be released at different times into the blood stream. The implantable pump, however, has to be activated by an externally generated signal after the patient himself has withdrawn a drop of blood, for example, from a finger, and subjected it to an analysis. This procedure is obviously somewhat painful, time consuming and, if neglected, injurious to the patient. Implantable drug delivery systems are relatively new. The first animal implant was performed in 1971, and in a human in the middle 1970&#39;s for the delivery of heparin in the treatment of chronic thromboembolic disease. In 1980 the first insulin delivery pump was implanted in a diabetic patient. Insulin infusion devices are currently implanted in over 200 diabetic patients worldwide today. Most pumps are implanted into the subcutaneous tissue in the chest area with an infusion catheter threaded intraveneously to a central location, such as the right atrium. There are at least two types of implantable pumps used today. One is a constant basal rate flow device in which the amount of flow is regulated by the length of the catheter used. The length and diameter of the catheter is fixed at manufacture. However, its rate of flow varies with increases in temperature and in altitude. The second type is a programmable infusion device which delivers insulin in small, discrete doses. The output of this type of device is digitally controlled by the patient under physician supervision. A radio transmitter is used to input the correct rate, time and amount of each dose via low-frequency waves which permeate flesh. The transmitter is located outside the body but close to the location of the pump which is implanted within the body. Implanted pumps have several advantages over the more generally used diabetic treatments, such as self-administered tests and injections. Far fewer external injections and, therefore, greater patient ease results. Also, when compared, for example, with the extreme case of replacing an organ such as the pancreas, the single greatest advantage of an implanted infusion device is that there is an ultimate limitation of organs available for transplant. Artificial pumps can be mass produced and are far more readily available than donor organs. Pumps also have the advantage of being compatible with every blood type and, therefore, do not have to be a specific blood type as donor organs must be. External insulin pumps, as distinguished from implantable pumps, are cumbersome and are often associated with skin irritation at the point of fusion. In comparing microprocessor control programmable electric pumps with constant rate infusion devices, the former are generally preferred because the constant rate infusion devices cannot cope with fluctuations of insulin requirements on a day-to-day or hour-to-hour basis, and perfect glycaemic control is not possible as with microprocessor controlled pumps. Major problems, however, do exist with implantation devices. Thrombosis around the tip of the infusion catheter or slowdown or succession of the pump are serious problems that reduce insulin flow into the blood stream. A reduction of the flow of insulin has been the result of insulin aggregation or fibron deposition within the catheter, clotting of the blood in contact with the catheter, particularly at the tip, is a problem. Flushing with an alkaline solution or fibrolitic agent or a tipectomy (i.e., removal of a portion of the catheter tip) may solve the problem. Obviously, however, these remedies require surgical procedures and, occasionally, the entire catheter and/or pump must be replaced. Present day implanted pumps are open-loop systems or one-way systems (i.e., glucose sensing and testing is external and medication infusion is unidirectional upon signal). Severe hypoglycemia (an abnormal decrease of blood sugar) due to an insulin overdose and ketoacidosis (an excess of ketones in the blood stream due to an insulin deficiency) are eminent dangers of open-loop implanted pumps. These problems, obviously, can result from human error in monitoring and/or sensing glucose level or in calculating dosage incorrectly. Accordingly, it is one of the broader objects of the present invention to produce a blood analyzing and medication delivery method and mechanism for performing the same, which has greater patient safety and comfort. Another object is to produce a combined blood monitoring and medication administering system which is completely implantable in a human or animal. It is yet another object of the present invention to produce a completely automatic blood monitoring and insulin administering system which is free of human error and which does not require activation by the patient. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention resides in a method of automatically monitoring blood chemistry and administering medication determined to be required by the chemistry, all of which is performed within the body of a human or animal. In addition, apparatus for performing all the method steps is disclosed.",

    "abstract": "The present invention is embodied in a resilient structure having a multitude of randomly orientated pieces of differing three dimensional shapes. The filler of the present structure is pieces of foam material formed with surface areas which are conducive to retentive abutment with adjacent filler pieces to resist packing as occur with pieces of filler material having curved surface areas. The pieces of the present filler tend to adhere to one another by reasons of edge-to-surface engagement between two adjacent pieces. Heretofore the repeated loading of a cushion with discrete filler resulted in the nesting or packing of the filler to eventually reduce article resiliency. Curved surfaces on filler pieces contributes to such packing. Formation of the present filler pieces is accomplished in a manner resulting in flat or near flat surfaces of the filler pieces along one or both axes of each surface. Such flat or gently curved surfaces of the pieces result in the pieces frictionally adhering to one another even during compression of the pillow, pad, etc. Angular edges of the filler pieces contribute to maintaining this desirable relationship between adjacent pieces. Important objectives of the present resilient structure include the provision of a structure for placement on a rigid or yieldable surface to provide cushioning for the human body to distribute support over a large area of the body to prevent bed sores which result from protracted compression of body tissue; the provision of a resilient structure that may be shaped to a degree to provide optimum support of a body member; the provision of a resilient structure that is not easily contaminated yet is open to the passage of air; the provision of a resilient structure with strap means for securement to a supporting structure such as a mattress, chair seat, auto seat, etc.; the provision of a resilient structure having a filler material which resists packing after long use and hence retains its resiliency as opposed to known articles in which the quantity of filler material tends to &#34;shrink&#34; by reason of compaction",

    "abstract": "Description of Related Art At present, various medical rehabilitation beds are commercially available on the market, the majority of which are structured to have fixed bed boards and bed stands. The height adjustment of beds is carried out with the bed stands by caretakers and family members. Traditional transmission mechanisms are heavy, labor-some and noisy, which directly or indirectly affects the treatment quality of patients. According to the physical conditions of patients and to the treatment requirements, patients need to sit upright or a certain part is needed to rise, for example, adjustment to the head or the feet. Therefore, a medical rehabilitation bed which is simple in adjustment, convenient and safe, and can be operated by patients themselves by their own requirements is needed. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Aiming at defects of the prior art, the present invention provides a medical rehabilitation bed to achieve the objectives of simple and excellent structure, safety in use, light weight, diversified and flexible functions. To achieve the above objectives, the present invention employs the following technical solution: A medical rehabilitation bed includes a bed head, a bed tail and a bed board, wherein a pull rod is arranged at the bottom of the bed board; the pull rod is rod-like with one end mechanically connected to a bed head gearbox which is arranged at the bed head, and the other end mechanically connected to a bed tail gear device which is arranged at the bed tail; transmission systems having the same structure and capable of controlling the bed head and the bed tail to ascend and descend are respectively arranged in the bed head and the bed tail; and the transmission systems are mechanically connected to the bed head gearbox and the bed tail gear device, respectively. The bed head includes a bed stand, a bed head board, a bed head frame, roller bayonets, bayonets, connectors, connector dowel pins, lifting racks, roller fixing blocks and rollers.

    "abstract": "It is an object of the present invention to provide an escape device providing a controlled rate of descent for an escaper. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an escape device which can be used sequentially by several individuals in a short period of time. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an escape device which can be rapidly secured to a building or other structure in such a manner that it will extend from the outer surface of the structure by a distance sufficient to prevent an escaper from contacting the building. It is a final object of the invention to provide an escape device which is rapidly attachable to a building or other structure and includes means for permitting an escaper to transit from the interior of the structure to the exterior of the building and position himself to drop straight down without contacting the structure. These objects are accomplished by a device including a casing containing a rotatably mounted spool. A cable is wound on the spool. The cable has one end secured to the spool and a second end having a thimble for attachment of the latch of a safety belt harness. The spool is rotatably mounted on a shaft which is connected through chains and sprockets to a brake device within the casing, for controlling the rate of unwinding of the cable from the spool. According to the present invention, the shaft upon which the spool is mounted has one end fixed to one side wall of the casing. The opposite side wall of the casing has a door at a position corresponding to the spool. The door is sized and positioned so that the spool can be introduced and removed from the casing through the door. Moreover, the spool is held on the shaft by a hexagonal nut rotatably mounted on the shaft and engaged with a hexagonal enlargement of the axial bore of the spool. This engagement prevents relative rotation of the spool and nut, but permits the spool to be quickly slid off of the shaft. During operation, the spool is prevented from sliding off the shaft by the door. However, upon the opening of the door, the spool can rapidly be slid off the shaft with a single motion and replaced with a fresh spool having a fresh cable wound thereon. Therefore, in use of the invention once a first individual has descended, the door is opened, the used spool is quickly slid off the shaft, a new spool is slid on the shaft and its cable prepared for unwinding, after which the door is closed and a new descent operation can begin. According to a further feature of the invention, the casing is provided with cooperating locking feet which hold the casing above, for example, a window sill such that the end of the casing from which the cable extends is positioned at a distance beyond the exterior wall of the building. The rear locking feet which engage the inner walls of the building for example, are each adjustably mounted on a securement rod so that they can be adjusted for the thickness of the building wall. Moreover, hand grips extend outward from the outermost end of the casing. A user can grip the hand grips to prepare and hold himself in position when initiating a descent.",

    "abstract": "The invention relates to a fixable positioning system for secure, playfree fastening to the human body. In particular, it relates to a device for noninvasive or intraoperative positioning and fixing of surgical, diagnostic or therapeutic instruments in the human body, especially to the human skull, preferably in the area of the external auditory canal and in the middle ear. Description of Related Art Based on the fact that, to some extent, considerable relative movements between the instruments and the target structures on the body can occur with hand-guided medical instruments, and that these relative movements are in part associated with considerable risks for the patient, it is desirable to anchor these instruments, on the one hand, securely to the body, while to be able to guide them in three dimensions within certain limits, after completed anchoring to the human body, on the other hand. Moreover, it should be possible to fix the three dimensional location between a positioned instrument and the destination on the body in order that a change in the position of the tool during subsequent surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic working steps is avoided. Fixing of devices securely to the body for receiving and three dimensional positioning of suitable instruments, however, is complicated for a host of surgical interventions, especially on the human skull, since the human skull has only a few structures to which suitable holders can be reversibly attached. To prevent relative movements between the body of the patient and guided instruments, it is basically possible to securely mechanically join the patient and instrument. In view of the extraordinarily small and sensitive anatomic structures in the human body, longer (more than a few seconds) hand-guided retention of the instrument position is almost impossible or requires from the physician or surgeon considerable expenditure of force and concentration. However, many surgical interventions in the body, mainly in the skull area, require targeted positioning of suitable instruments, which can be fixed for longer time intervals. Two different head holders are already known from the prior art. The so-called Mayfield clamp is firmly anchored to the head end of the surgical table with a tripod. The patient&#39;s head is placed into the receiver secured to the table and is clamped there by means of three conical threaded arbors which press on the skull through the skin. The procedure is painful overall and can be implemented for neurosurgical interventions only with local anesthesia or general anesthesia, and for general anesthesia, generally, in-patient status in an ENT (ear, nose &amp; throat) clinic is necessary. The company Radionics of Wiesbaden, Germany has marketed a frame which is secured to the skull using four conical threaded arbors. This frame can be briefly worn by the patient on an ambulatory basis or if necessary can, likewise, be fixed on the operating table. The frame is used as a coordinate base for stereotactic target operations in the skull. With this known device, clamping of the skull with the metal arbors is painful and it should be done with local anesthesia. Both of the described holders are used to preclude relative movements between the head and operating table. With tools likewise fixed securely to the table, then, the required precision between the tool and head can be established. These systems are technically complex, are tied to the operating room, and moreover, have the disadvantage that the patient must be anesthetized for clamping of the skull in the supporting device, since these holders work with relatively high compressive forces which are applied at several points. SUMMARY OF THE INENTION The object of the invention is to eliminate the disadvantages known from the prior art. Thus, in particular, a further object is to provide a, preferably, relatively small and light, multiaxial positioning system which can be directly attached to the skull of the patient in combination with a suitable holder, especially a portable head holder, without incorporating a larger base, for example, an operating table. It is another object of the invention to provide a positioning system which can be attached, together with the holder selected for the application, to the head of the patient, without additional aids, simply and easily. These objects are achieved in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention by a manually operated positioning system of the initially mentioned type which can be locked in its degrees of freedom and which has the following components: a base for secure connection of the positioning system to the holder; a linear axis which can be manually positioned via a threaded drive; a receiving device guided along the linear axis for a surgical, therapeutic or diagnostic instrument; and a ball-and-socket joint with several rotational degrees of freedom, which can be fixed via a clamp mechanism, which can be manually positioned, and which is located between the base and the linear axis. The positioning system according to the invention allows any instrument to be accommodated, attached without play, or simply changed. Furthermore, the inventive system enables the physician to guide the attached instrument, precisely and free of relative movements, to structures in the human body by means of several axes. The positioning system which is fixed securely to the body is used with its receiver for any actuator, sensor, mechanical or optical instruments as an &#34;artificial, tremor-free hand&#34; of the physician or surgeon, who can now position the free, active end of the instrument, by means of several precisionmechanical axes, at a destination on/in the body without significantly risky relative movements occurring. By means of the clampable positioning system which is proposed by the invention, especially by the embodiments specified below, a host of advantages is achieved. A simple compact structure is formed from relatively few parts which, themselves, in turn, can be simply structured and built. This also ensures a high measure of hardware safety in proper use for users, patients and third parties. Also, external influences, such as tremors, changes in temperature, location and pressure, cannot adversely affect the function of the system.",

Description of the Prior Art Prior art devices for simulating the structure and movement of the upper and lower jaw bones of a patient were unable to adequately provide exact movement and relationships between the bones. Such devices used a one point method of determining the relationship between the maxilla and mandible and therefore only accounted for under and overbite situations. These devices did not account for the sideways alignment of the maxilla and mandible. Furthermore, these devices are only able to align casts of the maxilla and mandible along a single point. Preparation of these devices for simulation required a large amount of time as did the examination of the structure of the maxilla and mandible in order to plan the subsequent surgery. While these units may be suitable for the particular purpose to which they address, they would not be as suitable for the purposes of the present invention as heretofore described. It is thus desirable to provide an oral surgery simulating device wherein the casts of the maxilla and mandible may be secured thereto and be rotated axially as well as laterally and longitudinally to provide a realistic model of the movement of the bones of the patient. It is further desirable to provide an oral surgery simulating device able to take measurements relative to Frankfurt&#39;s horizontal plane and transferring the measurements to the device to provide a proper alignment of the maxilla and mandible casts of the patient in both the longitudinal and lateral directions.

It is even further desirable to provide an oral surgery simulating device able to provide a mandibular ramus facsimile which is adjustable to provide posterior, anterior, superior and inferior movement. It is still further desirable to provide an oral surgery simulating device able to reduce the preparation time necessary for planning surgery. SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION The present invention relates generally to equipment for simulating oral surgery and, more specifically, to a device for aiding a surgeon in planning surgical cuts and procedures prior to oral surgery whereby the device is able to simulate the structure and movement of the condyle, ramus, mandible and maxilla of the patient using a cast and measurements taken from the patient to provide a model on which the surgeon can plan the operation.

A further object of the present invention is to provide an oral surgery simulating device having a universal mandibular ramus facsimile for use in simulating a sagittal split of the mandibular ramus. A further object of the present invention is to provide an oral surgery simulating device wherein the device is able to provide a replica of the upper and lower jaws of a patient for aiding in the planning of oral surgery by a surgeon. Another object of the present invention is to provide an oral surgery simulating device able to reduce the amount of time needed for preparation of the oral surgery and provide the surgeon with a more accurate plan regarding the necessary steps to perform during surgery. A still further object of the present invention is to provide an oral surgery simulating device that is simple and easy to use. An even further object of the present invention is to provide an oral surgery simulating device that is economical in cost to manufacture. Additional objects of the present invention will appear as the description proceeds. An oral surgery simulating device for planning an oral surgery for a patient is disclosed by the present invention. The oral surgery simulating device includes a stand including a base, a device for receiving a cast of a mandible of the patient movably connected to the base of the stand, a device for receiving a cast of a maxilla of the patient connected to the stand and positioned atop the cast of the mandible and a pointing unit releasably connected to the stand for aligning the cast of the mandible and the cast of the maxilla with relation to Frankfort&#39;s horizontal plane to thereby provide a replica of an upper and lower jaw of the patient. The device for receiving the cast of the maxilla is adjustable in a lateral direction and rotatable about an axis. The pointer unit includes a pole, a C-shaped clamp connected to and slideable along a length of the pole and first, second and third pointers extending from the C-shaped clamp for measuring the upper and lower jaw of the patient in relation to Frankfort&#39;s horizontal plane. The device for receiving the mandible includes an adjusting device which based upon measurements taken by the pointer unit is able to position the cast of the mandible in a position replicating the lower jaw of the patient. The device for receiving the maxilla also includes an adjusting device which based upon measurements taken by the pointer unit and the positioning of the cast of the mandible is able to position the cast of the mandible in a position replicating the upper jaw of the patient. A mandibular ramus facsimile is also pivotally connected to the stand for simulating the ramus of the patient.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a patient rehabilitation system, more particularly, a rehabilitation system utilized for rehabilitation and physical therapy of injured limbs and joints. To elaborate further, the present invention is a continuous passive motion exercise system with a driven monitoring device, utilized for reflecting on the state changes of the adhesiveness and the stiffness of patients&#39; injured joints for monitoring their rehabilitation conditions, as well as for controlling the rehabilitation mechanism safely. 2. Description of Related Arts Limb joints, such as knee joints, hip joints, elbow joints and wrist joints are all crucial mechanisms for humans to conduct various activities, including walking, running, jumping, standing, stepping up and down of stairs, dancing and track-and-field activities that require twists, turns or weight-carrying of joints. In view of the dynamics of a human body, since joints have to sustain most of the weight loading during bodily activities or motions, joints are susceptible to injuries, and abrasions with age, especially for knee and hip joints that carry most of the body weight. After being injured or aged, such joints sometimes have to be cured by replacing with artificial joints, so as to resume original functions. After surgeries, a long period of rehabilitation therapy soon follows for fully recovery, which might take from a few months to half a year, and thus causes patients great inconvenience. One of the rehabilitation therapy is to maintain continuous exercise of joints to avoid adhesiveness among tendons, and to supply nutrition to joints. In such ways, this procedure enables joints to resume the normal range of motion as soon as possible, and thus shortens the period of time for patients to stay in hospitals or in beds. Therefore, clinically, the continuous passive motion exercise systems are widely utilized in rehabilitation procedures after patients with surgeries on joints. The continuous passive motion exercise systems currently employed cannot provide information regarding the patients&#39; conditions of rehabilitation such as their progress and the effect of their therapy. Thus, doctors or professional rehabilitation personnel may only rely upon past experience to make decisions to adjust rehabilitation procedures to befit each patient. General clinical rehabilitation procedures usually employ simple and generic processes for all, not being able to vary according to individual states. Furthermore, since continuous passive motion exercise systems engages patients&#39; injured joints and move reciprocatively, to certain joint flexing or extension angles during exercises, patients might feel pain. Such exercise systems, currently available without being able to automatically adjust properly to suit patients&#39; needs, can only be manually stopped by patients themselves. The pain caused by overbending, overextending or speeding can only be inspected and relieved afterwards. Such a drawback might cause secondary injury to patients. In addition, joints with general joint diseases such as osteoarthritis, after surgeries, are likely to be stiff and cannot act well. Current exercise systems are not able to provide proper indices showing states of stiffness for joints, as well as indices for the evaluation of joint rehabilitation. Therefore, during rehabilitation, precisely and effectively monitoring and recording the degree of stiffness and viscosity for joints not only avoid any ill operations of exercise machines so as to protect patients from further injuries, but also provide doctors and patients with more rehabilitation information, thus, to enable more effective and speedy therapies. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of present invention is to provide patients and doctors with the joint viscosity and stiffness variation statuses of patients during rehabilitation periods. Another object of present invention is to provide patients with an extra safety-enhanced feature to prevent possible joint injuries doing continuous passive motion exercises all through mounting a driving-force or driving-torque monitoring and recording device onto a continuous passive motion device with the associated mathematical algorithms to calculate the necessary information. After each rehabilitation session, such a system can provide several indices regarding the change of the joint viscosity and stiffness to indicate the current therapeutical progresses. And such indices can then be compared with previously stored rehabilitation indices so that the conditions of recovery of patients&#39; joints can be acquired for the reference of doctors and patients. Therefore, the effects of current rehabilitation therapies can be analyzed and thus effective treatment and better rehabilitation process can be established. Furthermore, a safety-enhanced feature, built in the system, based upon the strength of patients&#39; active joint muscle contraction, controls automatically the motion of the system so that when patients feel pains during exercises, the system will response accordingly in order to reduce the possible secondary injuries to patients. Based upon the embodiments of the present invention, a continuous passive motion exercise system is provided for measuring the stiffness and viscosity of patients&#39; joints, and reacts to the strength of patients&#39; active muscle contractions so as to adjust the operations of such an exercise machine, which is comprised of a mounting device, having at least one degree-of-freedom mechanism capable of conducting reciprocative angular displacement; a driving device connected to the mounting device, for providing with a driving force or torque so as to continuously drive the mechanism to conduct reciprocative angular displacement motion; and a driven monitoring device comprising sensor means for sensing said driving force or torque. In one aspect of the present invention, when the jointed limb of the patient is fastened onto the mounting device and brought to motions, the driven monitoring device then calculates the average of the work done by the driving force or torque in one complete cycle of many repeated and predetermined reciprocative angular displacement motion cycles in an assessment or a rehabilitation period. The said average defined as the joint agility average and the number of reciprocative cycles are then recorded and will be used to compare with the same patient&#39;s agility averages recorded previously or afterward, better with the same number of reciprocative cycles, through the same predetermined reciprocative motion pattern. The difference between two agility averages then represents the change of agility or viscosity of the joint from one state to another state. Hence, the changes in the whole recorded agility averages stands for the history of the variation of the agility or viscosity of the joint during the recorded assessment or rehabilitation period. In another aspect of the present invention, when the jointed limb of the patient is fastened onto the mounting device and brought to motions, the driven monitoring device then calculates the average of the difference of the works done by said driving force or driving torque between the first half and the second half cycles in one complete cycle of many repeated and predetermined reciprocative angular displacement motion cycles during an assessment or a rehabilitation period. Then, the sign of the average work done by joint elastic force in the first half cycle will be determined from the same assessment period. The calculated average then multiplies the calculated sign to obtain the joint stiffness average. The joint stiffness average, and the number of reciprocative cycles are then recorded and will be used to compare with those recorded previously or afterward for the same patient, better with the same number of reciprocative cycles, through the same predetermined reciprocative motion pattern. The difference between two said joint stiffness averages then represents the change of elasticity or stiffness of the joint from one state to another state. Hence, the changes in the whole recorded joint stiffness averages stands for the history of the variation of the elasticity or stiffness of the joint during the recorded assessment or rehabilitation period. In a further aspect of the present invention, when the jointed limb of the patient is fastened onto the mounting device and brought to motions for a continuous passive motion rehabilitation session, the driven monitoring device will record an average force (or torque) profile of the driving force (or troque) in one complete cycle for the first several cycles if no noticeable active joint muscle contractions or pains occur. Several stages of variations from the average profile are preset for the mounted device to slow down, stop or retract. The driven monitoring device then constantly compares the magnitude of abnormal variations from said average force (or torque) profile with the preset stages in each reciprocative angular displacement motion cycle so as to adjust the motion of the mounting device according to those presets. In one more aspect of the present invention, the driven monitoring device comprises a data recorder to record and a data transceiver interface to receive from and transmit to external data storing and/or analyzing devices the associated values of the predetermined reciprocative motion pattern, numbers of cycles, said averages, duration of use, and patient&#39;s ID, for future analysis and evaluation.",

    "abstract": "This invention is related to the discovery that certain compounds with albumin-binding properties can inhibit nonenzymatic glycation of albumin in vivo. The invention further relates to the ability of such compounds to prevent kidney dysfunction manifest by increased urine albumin excretion. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Nonenzymatic glycation of albumin is a condensation reaction between glucose and reactive epsilon amino groups of lysine residues in the protein. The reaction is initiated with attachment of the aldehyde function of acyclic glucose to albumin via nucleophilic addition, forming an aldimine, also known as a Schiff base. This intermediate undergoes an Amadori rearrangement to form an amino-deoxyfructose derivative (fructosyllysine) in stable ketoamine linkage. The Amadori product may give rise to a heterogeneous group of poorly defined advanced glycation end products (AGE), the formation of which is believed to evolve through various rearrangement, dehydration, oxidation and polymerization reactions. Prior art has suggested a pathophysiologic role of AGE-modified protein in disorders associated with aging and with diabetes, and that inhibition of AGE-crosslink formation might be beneficial in the treatment of such disorders (Brownlee et al, Science 232:1629, 1986; New Engl J Med 318:1315, 1988; Vlassara, J Lab Clin Med 124:19, 1994). However, recent experimental work indicates that albumin modified by Amadori glucose adducts is an important pathogenetic factor in the development of kidney and vascular dysfunction in aging and in diabetes. Glycated albumin exists in vivo principally as the Amadori product and its concentration is driven by the ambient glucose concentration to which albumin is exposed during its residence time in the circulation. Glycated albumin normally constitutes about 1-2% of total plasma albumin, and may be increased one-and-a-half to three fold in diabetes (Cohen and Hud, J Immunol Meth 122;279, 1989). Experimental studies have shown that Amadori-modified glycated albumin has distinct biologic effects that non-glycated albumin does not possess. These glycated albumin-induced effects, which include stimulation of matrix production by kidney and vascular cells, mimic the changes associated with glomerulosclerosis and vasculopathies, are likely mediated by ligand-receptor systems for the glucose-modified epitope in the glycated protein, and can be prevented by molecules capable of reacting with the Amadori adduct in glycated albumin (Ziyadeh and Cohen, Molec Cell Biochem 125:19, 1993; Cohen et al, Molec Cell Biochem 151:61, 1995; J Clin Invest 95:2338, 1995; Cohen and Ziyadeh, Kidney Int 45:475, 1995; Wu and Cohen, Biochem Biophys Res Comm 207:521, 1995). Such molecules may be monoclonal antibodies or other compounds which specifically bind to the fructosyllysine epitope present on glycated albumin but not present on non-glycated albumin, and which are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,223,392 and U.S. Pat. No. 5,518,720. The deleterious biologic effects of glycated albumin make it desirable to have the means to prevent the attachment of glucose to albumin lysine-amino groups and thereby lower glycated albumin concentrations. Such means would beneficially influence the development of kidney and vascular dysfunction in aging and in diabetes by mechanisms different from those disclosed in the prior art, which are designed to neutralize the biologic effects of glycated albumin. One manner by which lowering of glycated albumin concentrations could be accomplished in people with diabetes would be with intensive regimens for control of blood glucose levels. The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial showed that reducing the concentration of glycated protein in the circulation with intensive insulin therapy lowers the risk for development of nephropathy and retinopathy (New Engl J Med 329:977, 1993). However, it is widely appreciated that implementation and maintenance of intensive regimens such as those used in the DCCT are difficult and may be risky, and that the majority of diabetic patients remain significantly hyperglycemic with current antidiabetic therapies. Further, such regimens do not apply to non-diabetic people at risk for kidney or vascular disease. Another means by which lowering of glycated albumin concentrations could be achieved is with compounds that prevent condensation of glucose with lysine amino groups. Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), by virtue of rapid acetylation of epsilon amino groups, can competitively inhibit this reaction (Rao and Cotlier, Biochem Biophys Res Comm 151:991, 1977; Rendell et al, J Lab Clin Med 107:286, 1986). However, the impact of widespread protein acetylation is unknown. Moreover, the glycation-inhibiting activity of aspirin is relatively weak and potential therapeutic benefits that might be ascribed to this activity are limited by the rapid hydrolysis and short half-life of acetylsalicylic acid in the blood and by side effects anticipated at doses required to inhibit glycation in vivo (Costello and Green, Arth Rheum 25:550, 1982; Rowland and Riegelman, J Phann Sci 57:1313, 1968). Other compounds which lack acetyl groups but bind to albumin in a manner that effectively interferes with the condensation of glucose with free lysine amino groups would be more desirable as glycation inhibitors. In an in vitro experiment van Boekel et al (Biochim Biophys Acta 1120:201, 1991) reported that 2,benzene acetic acid in concentrations of 1-5 mM could reduce the amount of sugar-attached protein after incubation of commercially purchased powdered albumin with 5 mM glucose-6-phosphate. However, the concentration of the compound required to inhibit sugar attachment in vitro, and the composition and concentration of the sugar substance used to glycate the protein, do not represent in vivo conditions. Therefore, the conclusion from this study is that the compound would not be effective in inhibiting albumin glycation in vivo since the primary sugar present in the circulation is glucose, and since the concentrations of the compound required to inhibit glycation in vitro would be toxic if given to living subjects. Additionally, van Boekel et al concluded that, because the compound binds to albumin, its concentration in tissues would be too low to be of import in disease states if administered in vivo. Van Boekel et al did not perform any in vivo experiments. The van Boekel et al study does not afford any evidence that the compound could affect glycation in vivo, and contra-indicates the possibility that in vivo administration of therapeutically acceptable amounts of the compound could lower glycated albumin concentrations in living human subjects or could beneficially influence kidney or vascular dysfunction in either diabetic or non-diabetic people. It is well known that nonenzymatic glycation under in vitro conditions does not represent that which occurs in vivo with respect to the number and nature of glycatable sites (c.f. Cohen, Diabetes and Protein Glycosylation, Springer Verlag, 1986, p.12; Diabetes and Protein Glycation, JC Press, 1996, pp. 8-9). It also is well known that although various reducing sugars such as glucose-6-phosphate can condense with protein amino groups in vitro, the concentrations required vastly exceed those found of such sugars in vivo, and that such reducing substances promote glycation that is not representative in chemistry or in nature of that which occurs in vivo. These facts lead one to conclude that the effect of diclofenac on the attachment of glucose-6-phosphate at 5 mM concentration in vitro cannot be extrapolated to the in vivo situation where glucose-6-phosphate resides intracellularly and at a lesser order of magnitude of concentration. Further, diclofenac is usually administered in daily amounts of 100-200 mg, and van Boekel et al required concentrations of 1-5 mM to achieve any inhibition of the binding of glucose-6-phosphate to albumin in vitro. The peak plasma levels of diclofenac obtainable after a dose of 100-200 mg are 1-2 ug/ml. This concentration is equivalent to 3-6 uM, which is 1000-fold less than the concentration found by van Boekel et al to be necessary to inhibit albumin glycation in vitro. These facts lead one to conclude that diclofenac would be clinically useless for inhibition of albumin glycation in vivo, since the amount required by van Boekel et al to be effective in vitro would be toxic and deleterious if administered in vivo to living subjects. Additionally, van Boekel et al emphasize that AGE, not Amadori products, are important in glycation-related disease affecting the kidneys and eyes, leading one to conclude that reducing glycated albumin per se would be without salutary effect in vivo on kidney function or in other vascular disorders. In short the available art indicates that the in vivo administration of therapeutic amounts of compounds such as diclofenac would be useless either for the purpose of lowering concentrations of glycated albumin in living subjects or for treating kidney dysfunction. The present invention discloses the novel and unexpected discovery that therapeutically acceptable amounts of diclofenac inhibit the formation of glycated albumin in vivo and prevent the development of kidney dysfunction in living subjects. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a means of preventing the nonenzymatic glycation of albumin in living subjects. The present invention also provides a novel method for preventing the in vivo formation of biologically active Amadori glucose adducts in the albumin molecule. Additionally, the present invention provides a novel method for limiting the in vivo generation of biologically active glycated albumin epitopes for interaction with their cell-associated receptors. The present invention is achieved with compounds capable of binding to albumin in such a way as to inhibit the reaction of glucose with lysine amino groups in the protein. The present invention also provides a method for treating kidney and vascular dysfunction in human subjects. The present invention further provides a method for preventing kidney dysfunction manifested by microalbuminuria.

    "abstract": "In one aspect, the present invention is a method for inducing or enhancing an erection in mammals comprising the administration of an effective amount of a compound of Formula I ##STR1## or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R 1  and R 2  are independently hydrogen, or a C 1-8  alkyl, C 2-8  alkenes, C 3-8  cycloalkyls and isomeric forms thereof, to the penis of such mammal. Preferably, the administration is by injection into the corpus cavernosum of said penis. Alternative, the active compound can be admixed with a pharmaceutical gel and applied transdermal to the glans penis. A preferred compound of Formula I is guanidine, N-cyano-N&#39;(1,1-dimethyl propyl)-N&#34;-3-pyridinyl or pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof (where R 1  is hydrogen and R 2  is 1,1-dimethyl propyl). Where administration is by injection, the active compound is administered in an amount of from about 0.5 micrograms (μg) to about 1000 μg, preferably 5 to 10 μg. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The subject invention is directed toward a treatment for impotence. Impotence is the consistent inability to achieve or sustain an erection of sufficient rigidity to have sexual intercourse. Specifically, the subject invention is a method for inducing or enhancing an erection by administering in an effective amount, preferably in low doses to the penis, a compound of Formula I: ##STR2## or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, wherein R 1  is independently hydrogen, or a C 1-8  alkyl, C 2-8  alkenes, C 3-8  cycloalkyls and isomeric forms thereof (which includes straight and branched chains). Preferably, Formula I is N-cyano-N&#39;(1,1-dimethyl propyl)-N&#34;-3-pyridinyl guanidine (R l  is hydrogen and R 2  is 1,1-dimethyl propyl). Preferably, the compound is administered by injection to the penis and preferably into the corpus cavernosum of the penis. More preferably the drug can be delivered in a pharmaceutical preparation, diluent or gel, by injection or topical application, respectively. For injection, the active compound can be diluted in a saline solution, purified water or combination thereof. Topical preparations can include the active compound with N-methyl pyrrolidone, oleyl alcohol, propylene carbonate, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or combinations thereof. The preferred compound of the subject invention is N-cyano-N&#39;(1,1-dimethyl propyl)-N&#34;-3-pyridinyl guanidine although its related compounds as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,057,636 and its Reissue U.S. Pat. No. Re 31,244 (herein incorporated by reference) can be effective also. The compound of Formula I is administered in an effective amount which is sufficient to cause or enhance the erection. Typically, the dose is from about 0.5 micrograms to about 1000 micrograms preferably from about 5 micrograms to about 10 micrograms in man. The response appears to be dose related and therefore increasing amounts are directly related to the duration or size of the erection. Of course, different male mammal species would have dosages relative to their anatomical size and weight. Calculation of dosages would be a routine calculation to anyone of ordinary skill of the art such as a veterinarian, urologist, or physician. The pharmaceutical properties of the subject compounds to behave as a vasodilator was confirmed utilizing an in vitro rabbit mesenteric artery assay. Rabbit mesenteric artery tissue was equilibrated at one gram resting tension for one hour in physiological saline solution (PSS) prior to producing a first norepinephrine contraction. At the plateau of the first norepinephrine contraction, acetylcholine (ACH 1 μM) was added to study endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Thus, ACH-induced relaxation was routinely used as a test for the presence of functional endothelium. The tissues were washed with PSS, and were again left at the resting tension for one hour, before challenging them with the second norepinephrine contraction. At the plateau of the second norepinephrine contraction, the subject compounds were tested at concentrations of 0.01 μM to 0.5 μM. Each concentration was tested for about ten minutes or until relaxation plateaued. All compounds were not tested at all levels where vasodilation effect was or was not apparent. The percent relaxation was measured for each compound as shown in Table 1. The data was generated from 28 mesenteric rings from four rabbits.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a retention and release mechanism for ski boots, and, more particularly, relates to a mechanism and ski boot construction which allows for a safe and biomechanically natural rearward articulation of a user&#39;s foot for thereby substantially reducing the risk of severe injury. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION There is an inherent and known risk of injury associated with the sport of downhill skiing. A significant source of injury is the rigid association between a user and prior art skis and ski boots. In view of this, various prior art devices have been proposed for reducing the risk of injury in the sport of downhill skiing. The vast majority of these disclosures relate to improvements in the ski binding, i.e. the mechanism affixed directly to the ski for receiving the ski boot. In addition, there have been attempts to modify the ski boot itself. Generally, however, ski boot modifications have been directed to providing a mechanism for the wearer to more readily step into and out of the boot. For example, in U.S. Pat. No. 5,136,794 there is reported a ski boot consisting of a lower part and of a shaft, in the form of a collar, which is articulated on the lower part and provided with at least one closing buckle. The shaft includes, at the rear, a rocker that interacts with a stop that is integral with the lower part in order to lock the shaft in a position inclined forwards. The rocker is held in inactive position upon opening of the uppermost buckle by means of a cable and a spring. Thus, the shaft is not inadvertently locked during walking. Attention is also directed to U.S. Pat. No. 5,127,171 and art cited therein, which reports a ski boot with a shell having a shaft in two parts, the rear part of which is connected, on the one hand, to the shell and, on the other hand, to the front part of the shaft by two pair of links. The axes of articulation on the rear part are situated, in the closed position of the boot, on the sides of the plane containing the axes of articulation on the shaft and the front part of the shaft. It is possible to open the shaft wide for putting the boot on, while having only a limited rearward tilting of the rear part. The upper connection can be associated with a closing lever. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,107,608, there is reported a ski boot for reducing the incidence of knee injuries wherein the boot is said to exert a forward directional force on the skier&#39;s leg. A releasing means changes the rigid support position for the foot and the lower leg on application of a predetermined level of force by the boot on the wearer. The ′608 patent further reports that rearward pressure of the person&#39;s lower leg against the rear leg element of the boot can be sensed by force sensors producing electrical outputs by the use of piezoelectric material. In addition, as illustrated in FIG. 7 therein, a mechanical latch assembly employing a tension spring is disclosed. The tension spring is described as urging or maintaining the device in ski position, and, when spring force is overcome, a release position is obtained as shown in FIG.  8 . U.S. Pat. No. 5.283,964 discloses a boot device for front-to-back immobilization of the upper, which acts on an oscillating level capable of being supported against a stop on the shell base. The device is constituted by a rectilinear motion control mechanism. The mechanism includes an external control device having an inner part which actuates, via a cam, a sensing device associated with the oscillating lever, thereby imparting to the latter an angular rotating movement around its pin toward a locked or release position in relation to the stop formed on the shell base. Attention is also directed to following foreign patent documents: WO 92/05718 and 0514762A2. More specifically, in WO 92/05718 there is disclosed a ski boot for enhancing the safety of skiing. Finally, reference is made to EP-375-604-A, which discloses a ski boot with a stop holding the leg forward, and French Patent 2647-649-A, which discloses a ski boot with an articulated leg locked in a forward position. The leg has a clip at the back that pivots around the horizontal axis. All of the above, however, are distinct from the present invention, in that they collectively fail to provide, in the boot itself, a practical and effective mechanism for mitigation of knee injuries while used in skiing. There is, therefore, a long-felt need in the art for a ski boot retention and release mechanism that specifically reduces potentially injurious forces to the anterior cruciate knee ligament (ACL). Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a ski boot design that restricts the rearward movement of the rigid upper of a ski boot by allowing rearward travel of the same after a selected level or predetermined threshold of force has been obtained. Another object of the invention is to provide a ski boot design having a mechanism to affect upper displacement when appropriate to create a safer environment and enhanced safety to the user. Yet another object of the invention is to provide a ski boot design having a retention and release mechanism to for improving safety. Another object of the invention is to provide a ski boot that allows the potentially damaging rearward forces at the upper section of a ski boot to be absorbed or transduced. A further object of the invention is to provide a ski boot design which prevents or mitigates the severity of injuries to the anterior cruciate knee ligament and to provide a more safe natural biomechanical rearward articulation in the boot for the user thereof A further object of the invention is to provide a ski boot with a walk position combined with a release mechanism to improve safety. Yet a further object of the present invention to provide ski boot design which prevents or mitigates the severity of injuries to the anterior cruciate knee ligament that can be cost-effectively mass produced. These and other objects of the present invention will become apparent from a review of the description provided below.",

    "abstract": "Embodiments of the present disclosure generally relate to a container for packaging and dispensing of a solid cosmetic or care product. The container comprises a hollow base and a cap for holding the solid product. The cap is rotatably mounted on the hollow base of the container to present the solid product to a surface of application including skin, face, lip, eyelashes, hair, nail etc. (2). Description of the Related Art Present day cosmetic containers for packaging and dispensing solid cosmetic or care products such as solid antiperspirants, lipstick, lip balm, blush, cake mascara are receiving wide acceptance in the marketplace. Contemporary solid product containers generally require that a user push or screw the product upward out of a base or a receptacle to expose it for application. While these types of containers are functional, they are expensive in that they require either intricate multiple parts or expensive assembling techniques and machinery. Generally, these cosmetic containers utilize a product in cylindrical stick form and have relatively sharp edges which edges cause discomfort to the user when the stick is originally applied to the skin. Cosmetic stick form of product has been made in the past that do not require an advancing means for the product within the container. An example of such a container is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,728,210 issued to Barrish et al. on Mar. 1, 1988. This reference discloses a solid personal care product packaged in a container having a cover and handle, with the personal care product being attached to a gripping plate on the cover for removal from the container with the cover. The gripping plate preferably includes a porous member which is impregnated with a portion of the solid product to firmly grip the solid product for removal with the cover. Therefore, this package requires no advancing means. U.S. Pat. No. 4,235,557 issued to Hayes on Nov. 25, 1980 discloses a device having a product holding structure with a removable cover. Both the product holding structure and the cover have a cavity into which a hot-fill product may be introduced. Also attached to the product holding structure is a handle. In use, the cover is removed from the product holding structure to expose the product so that it may be applied. Since, the above mentioned containers for packaging and dispensing solid products have covers/caps which need to be removed from the container before using the product, there are increased chances of losing the cover. If the cover is lost, the above containers cannot be used for a longer time as the product will get deteriorated due to contact with air. It is an object of this disclosure to provide a container for packaging and dispensing a solid product wherein the container does not require the user to screw or push up the product to expose it from its housing/reservoir. It is a further object of this disclosure to provide a container for packaging and dispensing a solid product wherein the container provides a product shape which is comfortable to use even upon initial application. It is a further object of this disclosure to provide a container for packaging and dispensing a solid product, wherein the container does not have a removable cap thereby reducing chances of losing the cap.",

    "abstract": "The present invention recognizes and addresses particular disadvantages of prior art principles and constructions. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide enhanced and highly efficient warming and/or cooling of a bed environment. It is an object of this invention to provide a simple way to obviate the need for cumbersome warming/cooling envelopes, hoses, tubes, blankets or dangerous electrical wires in or over the bed, by operating as a single easily movable unit without additional separate external attachments. It is a further object of this invention to allow the user to maintain the comfortable, familiar bed coverings to which they are accustomed. By modifying the temperature of those coverings themselves as well as the air envelope created inside them, the total bed environment is made immediately comfortable to the user. It is a further object of this invention to easily create pre-heated or pre-cooled microenvironments within multiple undisturbed beds, without removal or disturbance of bed linens or coverings. It is also an object of this invention to introduce temperature-conditioned air into the bed by simply forcing the air into the space between the bed linens (e.g., between the bottom sheet and the bed covers). When activated, the pressure of the entering air causes the bed covers themselves to inflate slightly, thereby automatically distributing the warmed or cooled air to all parts of the bed. Another object of preferred embodiment of this invention is to complete an operational cycle and bring the bed interior to a comfortable temperature, before the occupant enters the bed. After the device is removed, the resting body, with suitable insulating or air permeable coverings, then effortlessly maintains a comfortable temperature through the principle of homeostasis.

Another preferred embodiment of the invention is a device for warming or cooling a bed, the device comprising: a (rear) housing, defining an air intake, interior air plenums and one or more air exits; a fan or other means for moving air into said air intake, through said air plenums and out said air exits; a heating element that functions to increase the temperature of the air that has entered said air intake; a temperature sensor attached to said heating element that monitors the temperature of said element; self-regulating safety temperature circuitry connected to said temperature sensor that automatically adjusts said heating element such that said heating element and/or the heated air remains below a specific safety temperature; a timer that can be set for a cycle such that said timer activates said device for a specified number of minutes or seconds and automatically deactivates said device when said timer has completed said cycle; an air delivery section, being one of said two connected sections of said device, serving as a means for moving air directionally forward and out said air exits. Preferably, said heating element is a thermoelectric heating/cooling element that either increases or decreases the temperature of the air that has entered said air intake, depending on the setting of a switch that reverses the polarity of said thermoelectric element. Preferably, the interior of said housing is divided into a plenum that directs conditioned air toward the front exits and a plenum that directs exhaust air toward the rear of said device. Preferably, the (front) air delivery section is partly comprised of a thermal mass substance, and may be detached after operation of said device and retained in the bed to provide additional heating. Preferably, the front air delivery section is in the form of a child&#39;s toy containing thermal mass material, and may be detached after operation of said device and left with a child to sleep with to provide an additional level of comfort. In another preferred embodiment, the invention is a self-contained, forced air bed warmer or bed warmer/cooler which safely and efficiently pre-heats or pre-cools the interior sheets and covers of a bed to provide a comfortable micro-environment that facilitates relaxation into restful sleep on cold or hot nights. Preferred embodiments comprise a heating/cooling element section and an air delivery section that lock together via a bayonet type joint. Preferably, the heating/cooling element section is generally cylindrical with a handle connected at a single point at the top rear of the section and projecting forward. This handle preferably provides a means of easily manipulating the device as well as acts as a catch to prevent blankets or covers from sliding over the rear body/air intake and blocking the flow of air. In preferred embodiments, a portion of the handle also functions as an exit for a reverse air plenum in the heating/cooling version. The heating/cooling section preferably contains a high-efficiency fan or device for moving air and an element for heating or cooling air. These parts function together to create a flow of hot or cool air that travels through the housing and out the openings in the air delivery section. The air delivery sections preferably generally resemble a flattened and flared tube, a flat semi-flexible oval or a child&#39;s stuffed toy animal. The flat oval air delivery section is preferably comprised of a semi-flexible thermal gel that acts as a thermal mass to retain heat or cold from the conditioned air directed through it. This air delivery section is designed to be detached from the heating/cooing section after deactivation of the device, and to remain in the bed with the occupant to provide additional passive radiant and conductive warming or cooling. The child&#39;s toy air delivery section is preferably constructed with an internal layer of thermal gel that similarly retains heat and cold.

Auxiliary holes are preferably provided in the air delivery section to allow a wider distribution of the air exiting the device and provide an alternative airflow in the event that the primary exit becomes obstructed. Preferred embodiments of the device comprise a timer mechanism that can be set such that the device activates for a period of one to five minutes and then automatically deactivates. Preferably, the device also contains a thermal sensor and self-regulating safety temperature circuitry that automatically adjusts the heating/cooling element and/or the heated air (when in the heating mode) such that they remain below a specific safety temperature regardless of the amount of air flowing through the device. In a preferred embodiment, the invention is a self-contained forced air bed warmer or bed warmer/cooler which safely and efficiently pre-heats or pre-cools the interior sheets and covers of a bed to provide a comfortable micro-environment that will facilitate relaxation into restful sleep on cold or hot nights. Preferably, it is an easily moveable, self-contained, hand-held appliance constructed of lightweight injection molded plastic. In preferred embodiments, the design and position of the handle of the device maintain the device in an optimal position relative to the bed covers and for unimpeded airflow. If one attempted to use a background art device for this purpose, it would not stay in position and the covers would invariably block the air intake, causing overheating, possible fire hazard and electrical cutoff or possible short circuit. Preferred embodiments of the device have an insulated air delivery section that is of sufficient length to conduct the warmed air into the mid-section of the bed. Background art devices do not have the length to perform this function and so would conduct very little air into the bed interior. In preferred embodiment, the air delivery section is a progressively flattened, flared and perforated tube, and represents an optimal shape for slipping between bed covers. Background art devices maintain near cylindrical profiles and would be ineffective for this purpose. Preferably, the device has a manual set minute timer and automatic safety temperature control circuitry that allows the device to be activated and left to safely complete the heating cycle unattended. Background art devices have no such features and thus are unsafe for this purpose. In a preferred embodiment, the invention is a self-contained forced air bed warmer that comprises means wherein elements such as aromatic herbal packets may be suspended in or introduced into the air moving through the device such that the air is modified or further conditioned by those elements, thereby adding aromatic or olfactory influences that further facilitate relaxation into restful sleep. Preferred embodiments of the device further comprise a twenty-four hour digital timer mechanism that can be set such that the device activates either immediately or automatically at any specified time within a twenty-four hour period for a period up to ten minutes and then automatically deactivates. Setting of the timer is preferably easily done via pushbuttons located on the exterior of the device housing.

    "abstract": "This invention relates to a biodegradable osteosynthesis implant constructed of a polymeric biodegradable base material with active ingredients that aid regeneration of bone tissue in a fracture area. 2. Description of Prior Art Metallic implants have been used in medicine for more than 200 years for fixation of broken bones. Success was achieved in the last decades with the selection of suitable compatible metal alloys to optimize the mechanical load-bearing capacity, and above all the tissue tolerance of these implants so that corrosion and rejection reactions rarely occur. Complications because of the metallic implants can arise in the course of X-ray and tomographic diagnostic processes. One main disadvantage associated with conventional implants is that metallic implants cannot remain in the human body over an unlimited time. It is therefore necessary to perform a second surgical procedure for removing the implant after the fracture has healed. This not only involves another stress for the patient, but also results in considerable costs for the second surgical procedure and the necessary second stay of a patient in a hospital. In addition, direct and indirect costs result from loss of work and after-treatment during the second healing of the wound. Therefore efforts have been made over a considerable period of time to replace the metallic materials with biodegradable polymers so that removal of the implant after healing of the fracture is no longer necessary. The use of a biodegradable plate in connection with osteosynthesis was first described by D. E. Cutright and E. E. Hunsuck in the Journal of Oral Surgery, Volume 33, pages 28 to 34 (1972). In developing novel biodegradable implants, it has been a goal to replace metallic implants. Thus the implant had to fix the bone fragments in place and support the mechanical forces acting on the bone. However, implants made of absorbable polyesters have inferior mechanical load-bearing capabilities when compared to implants made of metal. Although it was possible using suitable production methods, for example injection molding methods, and using optimized material mixtures to produce implants, for example fiber-reinforced implants, which could resist great tensile stresses, the flexible strength of such workpieces is relatively low and far below that of metal implants. A range of applications of biodegradable osteosynthesis materials is limited to lightly stressed, rapidly healing fractures. Such fractures can occur, for example, on the skull, such as a roof of the skull, a cheek bone or an upper jaw. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION As shown in FIGS. 1 a  and  1   b , an increase in the stability of the bone and a decrease in the stability of the implant are two dynamically occurring processes, which are expressed in two oppositely extending sigmoidal curves. Ideally, these curves are superimposed on each other in such a way that the stability of the implant decreases to the same extent as the stability of the bone increases again. The hypothetical course of the healing of the fracture with only the employment of a biodegradable osteosynthesis implant is represented in FIG. 1 a , such as occurs for example, in treatment of the above described fractures in the skull area. At the time equal to zero, the implant must be able to withstand the total mechanical stress, and the loss of mechanical stability, less a defined mechanical stability reserve, may advance no faster than it can be compensated by the increase in the stability of the healing bone tissue. It can also be seen from FIG. 1 a  that the loss of stability of the implant cannot be equated with its decomposition or loss of mass. The implant loses mechanical stability much faster by various physical and chemical processes, for example, by swelling, than it loses mass by abrasion and degradation. Generally an implant not only must fix the bone fragments in place during the healing of the fracture, but must also support the mechanical forces acting on the bone. The implant can be relieved from supporting the mechanical forces acting on the bone to a large extent by means of an external support such as plaster, splints or an external fixation device, and merely needs to assure the fixation of the fragments. This quite decisively increases the application range of biodegradable polymer implants. As shown in FIG. 1 b , the biodegradable and absorbable implant only needs to fix the bone fragments in a defined position with respect to each other until the bone material newly formed between them can take up this function again, and the additional fixation becomes unnecessary. But the mechanical stresses acting on the broken bone are supported by the external stabilizing device until the healing bone has regained a percentage of sufficient size of its mechanical properties, so that additional stabilization is no longer required. This does not mean that the bone must already have regained its full mechanical load-bearing capacity when the external stabilization means is removed. An affected area is commonly immobilized for an extended period of time, and the reduced muscle activity leads to loss of muscle and reduced mobility. To regain these, it is necessary to perform time-intensive and cost-intensive therapies after the removal of the external stabilizing means. Polylactide (PLA), polyglycolide (PGA), poly((ε-caprolcatone) (PCL), poly (β-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) or poly(p-dioxanone) (PDS) and their copolymers are decomposed in the body into the respective degradation products and can either flow into the body metabolism, or can be precipitated by the body through the urine or through breathing. Polylactide (PLA) and polyglycolide (PGA) and their copolymers are decomposed by hydrolysis. Since the amorphous areas of partially crystalline PLA degrade more rapidly than the crystalline areas, irritation and inflammation because of the crystallites can occur after disintegration of the implant in the surrounding tissue, as described by E. Wintermantel and S-W Ha, “Biokompatible Werkstoffe und Bauweisen,” in Biocompatible Materials and Structural Forms, Springer publications, Berlin 1996. A second cause of complications can be from the acid hydrolysis products of the implant. The acid degradation products are removed from the interior of the implant essentially more slowly than from its surface, which leads to the amassing of acid decomposition products and an increasing acceleration of the decomposition by auto-catalytically acting carboxyl groups. If at a later time during the decomposition the remaining outer wall of the implant breaks, a sudden release of the acid products and therefore a sudden pH drop in the surrounding tissue can occur, which can also lead to inflammatory reactions. The speed of bone healing can be accelerated by various growth factors (GFs). Soluble, low-molecular proteins, such as the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) have been known for some time for their local action on the growth of cartilage and bones, as set forth by Canalis, E. and L. G. Raisz, in Endocr. Rev. 4; pages 62 to 77 (1983). The same authors have proven a positive effect of IGF on the bone-DNA synthesis in periosteal and non-periosteal bones. One advantage of using IFG in the treatment of wounds and fractures is that up to now IFG has not shown any known relationship with oncogenes. Two insulin-like growth factors are commercially offered. IGF-1 (also known as Somatomedin C) is a basic polypeptide having 70 amino acids, and having a molecular weight of 7649 D. Inter alia, IGF-1 stimulates the insertion of proteoglycan in the cartilage by means of chondrocytes, as set forth by Froger-Graillard et al., in Endocrinology 124; pages 2365 to 2372 (1989), and in addition the synthesis of DNS, RNS and proteins. The slightly acid polypeptide IGF-2, like IGF-1, has four domains and has a molecular weight of 7471 D. IGF-2 has 64 amino acids. IGFs are mainly dependent on growth hormones (Somatotropin; GH). IGF-1 is preponderantly active in adults, while IGF-2 is the main growth factor of the fetus. Several active ingredients are known from the group of transforming growth factors (TGFs), which act to stimulate growth and aid in the healing of wounds. The proteins known as bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) can induce ectopic osteogenesis. Sampath et al., J.Biol.Chem. 27; pages 20352-62 (1992) have shown for recombinant human oesteogenetic protein-1 (hoP-1; BMP-2a), that it stimulates bone formation in vivo in the same way as the osteoblast proliferation and differentiation in vitro. D. L. Griffith et al., Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci. Biophysics 93(2); pages 878 to 883 (1996) describes the three-dimensional structure of osteogenic protein 1 (OP1; BMP-7), which can induce bone formation in vivo. Of the BMPs, which are members of the TGF beta super-family, BMP-4 and BMP-7 are available as recombinant proteins in addition to BMP-2. In vivo, purified recombinant BMPs appear to be only capable of inducing osteogenesis if they occur linked to suitable support materials or carriers, as set forth by E. Tsuruga et al., in J. Biochem. 121; pages 317 to 324 (1997).",

Success was achieved in the last decades with the selection of suitable compatible metal alloys to optimize the mechanical load-bearing capacity, and above all the tissue tolerance of these implants so that corrosion and rejection reactions rarely occur. Complications because of the metallic implants can arise in the course of X-ray and tomographic diagnostic processes. One main disadvantage associated with conventional implants is that metallic implants cannot remain in the human body over an unlimited time. It is therefore necessary to perform a second surgical procedure for removing t...",

    "abstract": "According to a broad aspect of the present invention, there is provided a mixing capsule assembly for mixing a plurality of materials by vibration, comprising: an outer capsule to receive one of the materials to be mixed; and an inner capsule to receive a second material to be mixed and to be enclosed within the outer capsule; the inner capsule including two sections attachable together to enclose the second material and to prevent it from mixing with the first material; the two sections of the inner capsule being attachable together by at least one pair of complementary, frictionally-engaging surfaces configured such that when the inner capsule is impacted against one inner face of the outer capsule during the vibration of the capsule assembly, the complementary surfaces are moved away from each other to permit some of the second material to pass therebetween and to mix with the one material, and when the inner capsule is impacted against the opposite inner face of the outer capsule during the vibration of the capsule assembly, the complementary surfaces are moved back against each other to block the passage therebetween of the second material. More particularly, the pair of complementary surfaces are constituted by the sides of a bore formed in one of the sections, and the sides of a stem formed in one end of the other of the sections. In addition, in both of the described embodiments, the opposite ends of the two sections are also in frictional engagement with each other. In one described embodiment, the bore in one section is of conical configuration, increasing in diameter from the outer to the inner end thereof, and the outer end of the stem in the other section is of complementary conical configuration and normally projects past the outer face of the one section so as to be impacted against the inner face of the outer capsule during the vibration of the capsule assembly. In a second described embodiment, the bore in one section decreases in diameter from the outer end to the inner end thereof, and the outer end of the stem in the other secti section is of complementary conical configuration and normally is recessed within the bore so that the one section of the inner capsule is impacted against the inner face of the outer capsule during the vibration of the capsule assembly, causing the stem to move further within the bore and thereby to permit the passage of the second material therethrough. In the latter described embodiment, the opposite end of the one section projects past the respective outer face of the other section such as to be impacted by the inner face of the outer capsule during the vibration of the capsule assembly, and thereby to permit some of the second material therein also to pass between the complementary surfaces at the opposite ends of the two sections df the inner capsule. While the invention is particularly useful for mixing two materials, such as in preparing dental amalgams, it will be appreciated that the invention could be used for mixing more than two materials, for example, by including within the outer capsule two or more inner capsules each of which includes a material to be mixed.

    "abstract": "This invention relates to platelet substitutes, i.e. compositions comprising fibrinogen, and also to conjugation methods that can be used, inter alia, to bind fibrinogen to a particulate carrier. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Covalently-bound conjugates, comprising an active drug and a carrier, are useful as a means of delivering the drug, e.g. to a specific site of action. Albumin has been proposed as a carrier for this purpose. Microparticles of albumin, their production and use as a carrier, are described in WO-A-9618388. The covalent attachment of large peptides and proteins to human serum albumin (HSA) microcapsules can generate a number of problems. Sufficient binding sites may not be available for cross-linking due to poor contact between the protein and the microcapsule surface. Also, intra-rather than intermolecular cross-linking is difficult to control when using short or zero length cross-linkers such as glycolaldehyde or EDC, respectively. This can lead to low loading of microcapsules and inactivation of the protein. Agam and Livne, in a series of papers, Blood 55:186-191 (1983), Thromb. Haemostasis 51:145-9 (1984) and 59:504-6 (1988), and Eur. J. Clin. Invest. (1991), showed that fibrinogen coated on fixed platelets augmented platelet aggregation, and that fibrinogen-coated erythrocytes reduced bleeding times in thrombocytopenic rats. Fixation involved the use of formaldehyde. Coller et al, J. Clin. Invest. 89:546-555 (1992), describe &#34;Thromboerythrocytes&#34;, an autologous, semi-artificial alternative to platelet transfusions. In order to avoid the limitations and drawbacks of using fresh platelets, erythrocytes were coupled to peptides containing the RGD cell recognition sequence, using a bifunctional cross-linker. In an abstract presented to the XVth Congress of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis, Jerusalem, Israel, on Jun. 11-16, 1995, Yen et al reported the haemostatic potential of &#34;Thrombospheres&#34;, i.e. cross-linked HSA microspheres, mean diam. 1.1-1.3 μm, with human fibrinogen covalently bound to their surfaces. In a thrombocytopenic rabbit model, ear bleeding times were reduced. The HSA microspheres were reportedly prepared by the procedure described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,069,936, i.e. a solution/desolvation process using glutaraldehyde as a cross-linking agent, ethanol to cause precipitation, and a surfactant to modify the surface of the cross-linked protein molecules. These steps do not provide size control of the microspheres, may cause bound protein to be degraded, and are unsuitable for large-scale manufacture of platelet substitutes. U.S. Pat. No. 5,069,936 describes the covalent bonding of various biological molecules, but not fibrinogen. A polyaldehyde is proposed as a covalent linking agent. Examples 12 and 14 use glutaraldehyde to bind antibody and enzyme (alkaline phosphatase), respectively. WO-A-9639128 (published Dec. 12, 1996) also describes &#34;Thrombospheres&#34;. Again, no specific preparation is given. Fibrinogen is an adhesive glycoprotein containing the sequence RGD(S). It and other such glycoproteins (including fibronectin and collagen, among others) may mediate the adhesion of tumour cells to sub-endothelial layers. These glycoproteins interact with integrins found in tumour cells, e.g. the fibronectin receptor, and the GPIIb/IIIa receptor on platelets; see Dardik et al, Int. J. Cancer 70:201-7 (1997). One of the major problems in the surgical treatment of cancers is the increased risk of tumour cells being released into the circulatory system. This is one reason for increased morbidity in patients with prostate cancer, after surgery. It would be desirable to remove circulating metastatic tumour cells, or inhibit their deposition on vascular surfaces. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to one aspect of the present invention, a new method for attaching peptides (by which is meant any peptide, polypeptide, protein or conjugate thereof) such as fibrinogen to microcapsules allows a spacer (e.g. small peptide or fatty acid) to be inserted between the protein and microcapsule. More specifically, the invention utilises the fact that a carrier such as HSA has free thiol groups, with which a bifunctional compound can react, the bifunctional compound having one group selectively reactive with the active component (drug) to be conjugated. By virtue of the invention, controllable cross-linking can be achieved due to the specificity of one of the linking groups for the free thiol group available on carriers such as HSA. Controllable cross-linking is one important aspect of the present invention, since it may have a direct bearing on the activity of the attached molecule. The spacer can include enzyme-cleavable peptides, acid or alkali-labile bonds and be of variable length, depending on the requirements of the application. The length of the spacer may be another important aspect of this invention, as it may determine the conjugate&#39;s ability to target receptors, such as fibrinogen to GPIIb/IIIa. According to a second aspect of the invention, e.g. by using the novel method, a novel pharmaceutically-acceptable product has utility as platelet substitutes. Such a product comprises an insoluble carrier, e.g. stabilised albumin, to which fibrinogen is bound, essentially without loss of the fibrinogen&#39;s activity. Binding may be non-chemical, e.g. by adsorption or chemical, e.g. using a linker at least 10 nm long. This invention provides, for the first time, pure, robust, therapeutically-acceptable, platelet substitutes. Purity may be embodied in the absence of chemical cross-linker and/or surfactant. They are suitable for use in the treatment of thrombocytopenia. It is an additional feature of the invention that, because fibrinogen acts as a targeting agent, products of the invention may usefully have other bound active agents. Such agents will be chosen with regard to the site of action, usually a wound or other bleeding locus, and to the nature of the problem that is addressed. DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION",

    "abstract": "This invention relates generally to fish scalers, and more particularly to a hand held fish scaler that is connected to a water source. 2. Description of the Related Art Fishing is a pastime widely enjoyed by many individuals; however, cleaning fish is often an unpleasant task. Removal of scales in particular is a time consuming and messy operation that requires the surface of a fish to be scraped with a scraping element many times in order to remove all of the scales and grime on the fish. As the scales and grime are removed, they tend to collect on the scraping element thereby obstructing it and rendering the scraping element ineffectual. This requires a user to rinse the scraping element with water to remove the scales and grime. Often a scraping element must be rinsed several times during the cleaning of a single fish, greatly adding to the time and effort required for fish cleaning. In addition, upon completion of scale removal the area must be cleaned up and the scales disposed of. Various fish scraping devices are known that incorporate a continuous flow of water directed at or on the scraping element such that it is continuously rinsed. These devices have a tube connected to a pressurized water source and one or more tube outlets that permit water to flow over the scraping element. Examples of such devices are disclosed U.S. Pat. No. 3,997,086 to Sexton, U.S. Pat. No. 4,258,452 to Adcock et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,297,765 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,339,850 to Altman et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 4,615,079 to Chartrand. These devices, however, do not satisfactorily solve the above problems. Many of these devices have water outlets that are close to the scraping element and thus as scales are removed the water outlets can become increasing clogged with fish scales and grime such that little or no water can flow over the scraping element. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION A fish scaler according to the present invention comprises a body having a forward scraping portion and a rearward handle portion formed continuously with one another and having a contiguous underside, a plurality of downwardly-depending teeth provided on each lateral side of the forward scraping portion, a grip area provided on the rearward handle portion for a user and a nozzle adapted to be fluidly connected to a source of pressurized water, the nozzle being located longitudinally rearwardly of the grip area. According to one aspect of the invention, the forward scraping portion can have at least one grip aperture formed therein located between the teeth. The at least one grip aperture can comprise a pair of longitudinally-spaced apertures for gripping by users having differently-shaped hands or comfort positions. According to another aspect of the invention, an outermost surface of the forward scraping portion can have an inwardly-extending recess which allows the user to maneuver the scraper around fins on the fish being scaled. The recess can be U-shaped and extend toward the rearward handle portion. According to yet another aspect of the invention, the body can be symmetrical about a longitudinal axis to have utility for either a right-handed or a left-handed user. According to still another aspect of the invention, the fish scaler can further comprise a tube interconnected with the nozzle that is adapted to be connected with a conventional source of pressurized water. The fish scaler can still further comprise an adapter fluidly interconnected at an opposite end of the tube for adapting the tube for connection to the conventional source of pressurized water. The fish scaler can still further comprise a connector having an adjustable valve for controlling the flow rate of water through the connector and into the tube. The adjustable valve can include a knob for adjustment of the adjustable valve by a user. The fish scaler can further comprise a glove wearable by a user for facilitating grasping the fish being scaled. The glove can comprise a gripping pattern on an exterior surface thereof. In yet another aspect of the invention, the nozzle can be directed along the underside surface of the body to direct pressurized water exiting the nozzle along the underside of the body toward the teeth on either side of the body, whereby the pressurized water cleans the teeth as the user performs a scraping action on the fish being cleaned. The nozzle can be located at a remote distance from the teeth, whereby debris from a scraping action performed by a user does not tend to clog the nozzle.",

    "abstract": "The present invention provides a sensor having an emitter(s) and a detector, with a layer having a first portion over the emitter and a second portion over the detector. A shunt barrier is included between the first and second portions of the overlying layer to substantially block transmission of radiation of the wavelengths emitted by the emitter(s). Preferably, the shunt barrier reduces the radiation shunted to less than 10% of the total radiation detected, and more preferably to less than 1% of the total radiation detected, when the sensor is used on patients having the most opaque tissue of all patients in the target population. In particular for a remanufactured or reinforced or modified sensor, the barrier is added in at least one, and more preferably in all, of the extra layers added or replaced during the remanufacturing, reinforcing or modifying process. The barrier of the present invention may take a number of specific forms. In one embodiment, a woven or fiber material is included between the emitter and detector. In another embodiment, the layer in-between the emitter and detector is pigmented with a color which is substantially opaque for the wavelengths of interest, while the portion above the emitter and detector is substantially transparent. In another embodiment, the entire layer is partially opaque, but is thin enough so that light transmitted through is able to penetrate the partially opaque layer, while light traveling the length of the layer would have a greater distance to travel and would be substantially absorbed. Another shunt barrier is the insertion of perforations in the layer between the emitter and detector. The perforations may provide air gaps, which still will shunt some light, or may be filled with other material or have the insides of the perforations colored with an opaque color. In another embodiment, the layer between the emitter and detector is made very thin, such as by embossing, welding or heat sealing. The thinness of the material will limit its effectiveness as a light pipe in the wavelengths of interest, red and infrared. In another embodiment, a deformable, opaque material, such as foam, is included between the emitter and detector, to be compressed upon application to a finger or other body part and fill any gap that might otherwise form through wrinkles or otherwise upon application of the sensor. In another embodiment, an adhesive is applied in a gap between two layers over the emitter and detector, to cause an underlying layer to come in contact with the patient, thus filling the air gap and preventing shunting along that path. While most of the illustrative examples given in this specification are shown as sensors adapted to be wrapped onto a digit, so that light is transmitted through the digit, it will be clear to those skilled in the art that the design principles illustrated may be applied to any “transmittance” or “reflectance” sensors for pulse oximetry.

As a consequence, the medical profession has suggested that the consumption of fat should be be reduced. One way to accomplish this is to eat meats that have been processed so that they contain a reduced amount of fat. \n         [0005]    One method to reduce the amount of fat in meat is simply to manually cut fat from the meat. Meat having higher amounts of fat is cut or trimmed from meat having lower amount of fat (meat that is more lean). The resulting trimmings are merely separated by ope...",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a kick exercise apparatus, and more particularly, to a kick exercise apparatus in which a plurality of striking portions are coupled to a body fastened to a gravity center frame or a treadmill that can move a position in order to exercise martial arts such as Taekwondo, karate, and kick boxing and that can exercise martial arts as a user strikes a striking portion using hand and feet. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION In general, when exercising martial arts such as Taekwondo, punch technology using hands and kick technology using feet are exercised by punching or kicking a sandbag hung from a ceiling, and when exercising actual Taekwondo technology such as competition, a pair of team joined with two persons competes. Exercise of punch using hands and kick using feet is very monotonous and there is a danger of an injury in competition, and when exercising punching or kicking, in order to improve a reflex action of a user and accuracy of punching or kicking, while a master holds a scoop type mitt and changes a position of the mitt, a trainee exercises punching or kicking, but there is a defect that the trainee alone cannot exercise punching or kicking. Nowadays, in order to solve the above defect, by installing a plurality of arms in a pillar and fixing a scoop type mitt to the arms, a trainee alone can exercise punching or kicking, but because a position of several scoop type mitts cannot be changed, there is a defect that an exercise effect is not appropriately exhibited. Further, Korean Unexamined Patent Application Publication No. 94-27953 applied by the present applicant has solved the defects, but elastic strength of a scoop type mitt is weak, it is difficult to install a sensor in the scoop type mitt, a striking position of the trunk is inaccurate, and direction lamps are scattered and installed and thus concentration of a trainee is deteriorated. Further, martial arts such as Taekwondo, karate, and kick boxing variously use technology of punching with hands or technology of kicking with feet. Exercise of martial arts using hand and feet is performed by punching or kicking a sandbag hung from the ceiling. Further, when exercising actual technology such as competition, a pair of team joined with two persons is competed, but exercise of punching or kicking is very monotonous, and in a process of competing, by striking a body of another party, the another party may be injured. In a process of exercising technology of punching or kicking, in order to improve a reflex action of a user and accuracy of striking, while a master holds a scoop type mitt in both hands and changes a position to the right side, the left side, the upper side, and the lower side, technology of punching or kicking is exercised. However, it is impossible to individually perform such exercise, and a supporter to hold the scoop type mitt is required. In order to solve the above defect, by installing a plurality of arms in a pillar and fixing a scoop type mitt to the arms, a trainee alone can exercise punching or kicking, but because a position of several scoop type mitts cannot be changed, there is a defect that an exercise effect is not appropriately improved. In order to solve the problem, a martial arts exercise apparatus (Korean Patent No. 0148427) in which a pillar for fastening to the ceiling and the bottom by a screw is provided and in which a scoop type mitt and a three surface mitt are coupled to the pillar and thus can perform individual martial arts exercise is suggested. However, in a conventional martial arts exercise apparatus, elastic strength of the scoop type mitt is very weak and a striking portion of the trunk is inaccurate. Further, it is very difficult to install the apparatus, and after the apparatus is installed, the apparatus cannot be moved. After holes are formed in the ceiling and the floor and a height of a support plate fastened to an upper part and a lower part of the pillar is adjusted, volts are inserted and are fastened to holes formed in the ceiling and the floor. In this case, holes should be formed at the ceiling and the floor to correspond to holes of the support plate, and the apparatus having a considerable weight should be supported. A height of the support plate is adjusted by a screw thread formed in the pillar, but when exercising martial arts, the support plate is moved by an external force applied to the apparatus and thus a problem occurs where a fastening portion coupled to the ceiling and the floor is separated. Further, in order to install the pillar, a height of the ceiling and the floor should be appropriate, and if a height of the ceiling and the floor is small, the pillar cannot be installed, and if a height of the ceiling and the floor is too large, after the apparatus is installed, a force for supporting the apparatus is low and thus a problem occurs where the apparatus is easily damaged and is separated occurs. At a location at which the ceiling and the floor are made of wood, the apparatus cannot be installed, and at a location at which the ceiling and the floor are made of marble, it is very difficult to form holes at the ceiling and the floor. Due to the above problems, it is difficult to move and install the apparatus from a location at which the apparatus is first installed to another location. Therefore, in a martial arts training hall for exercising martial arts, the apparatus is required, but it is very difficult to install the apparatus, and once the apparatus is installed, it is impossible to move the apparatus and thus it is not easy to install the apparatus. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention has been made in view of the above problems, and provides a kick exercise apparatus that can be conveniently installed, and moved around indoors and be installed at a new location. The present invention further provides a kick exercise apparatus that can be used to improve martial arts of a user by recognizing the user&#39;s ability through recorded data and adjusting exercise strength of the user in the process of striking a plurality of striking portions. The present invention further provides a kick exercise apparatus that can prevent a user&#39;s injury as an impact absorption member is coupled to a striking portion. The present invention further provides a kick exercise apparatus by which a user can individually exercise various striking technology as a plurality of striking portions are coupled to a front side, a side surface, an upper part, and a lower part of a body. In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a kick exercise apparatus includes: a body formed with a vertically installed rectangular parallelepiped frame; an upper cover and a lower cover for protecting the body at an upper part and a lower part of the body; striking portions installed at a front side of the body and at an upper part and a lower part of both sides of the body; and an impact absorption member fixedly installed at the outside of a plate of the striking portion, wherein one end of moving portion of a straight shaft in which a rack gear is formed is coupled to an inner center of the plate, one end of a guide plate in which a long hole is formed is coupled to a hinge rib of one of both sides of an upper part and a lower part of the plate, the long hole of the guide plate is inserted into and is moveably coupled to a guide rib of the body, the straight shaft is inserted into and coupled to a bushing coupled to the body, the rack gear is installed to engage with a pinion gear of a rotation shaft installed in the body, an elastic spring is installed around the straight shaft between the body and the plate, and a gravity center frame is coupled to a rear surface of the body. A sensor may be fixedly installed by a fixing volt at one side of the body in which the rotation shaft is installed. The sensor may be connected to a controller, and the controller may be connected to a display unit and an input unit, and in the input unit, various data of a time, a striking speed, the number of times of striking, a weight upon striking, a time change amount upon striking, an impact amount, and a impact force are set, and the display unit distinguishably displays measured values of striking applied to the striking portion.",

    "abstract": "Increasingly, pulse oximeters are being utilized in portable, battery-operated applications. For example, a pulse oximeter may be attached to a patient during emergency transport and remain with the patient as they are moved between hospital wards. Further, pulse oximeters are often implemented as plug-in modules for multiparameter patient monitors having a restricted power budget. These applications and others create an increasing demand for lower power and higher performance pulse oximeters. A conventional approach for reducing power consumption in portable electronics, typically utilized by devices such as calculators and notebook computers, is to have a “sleep mode” where the circuitry is powered-down when the devices are idle. FIG. 2  illustrates a sleep-mode pulse oximeter  200  utilizing conventional sleep-mode power reduction. The pulse oximeter  200  has a pulse oximeter processor  210  and a power control  220 . The power control  220  monitors the pulse oximeter output parameters  212 , such as oxygen saturation and pulse rate, and controls the processor power  214  according to measured activity. For example, if there is no significant change in the oxygen saturation value over a certain time period, the power control  220  will power down the processor  210 , except perhaps for a portion of memory. The power control  220  may have a timer that triggers the processor  210  to periodically sample the oxygen saturation value, and the power control  220  determines if any changes in this parameter are occurring. If not, the power control  220  will leave the processor  210  in sleep mode. There are a number of disadvantages to applying consumer electronic sleep mode techniques to pulse oximetry. By definition, the pulse oximeter is not functioning during sleep mode. Unlike consumer electronics, pulse oximetry cannot afford to miss events, such as patient oxygen desaturation. Further, there is a trade-off between shorter but more frequent sleep periods to avoid a missed event and the increased processing overhead to power-up after each sleep period. Also, sleep mode techniques rely only on the output parameters to determine whether the pulse oximeter should be active or in sleep mode. Finally, the caregiver is given no indication of when the pulse oximeter outputs were last updated. One aspect of a low power pulse oximeter is a sensor interface adapted to drive a pulse oximetry sensor and receive a corresponding input signal. A processor derives a physiological measurement corresponding to the input signal, and a display driver communicates the measurement to a display. A controller generates a sampling control output to at least one of said sensor interface and said processor so as to reduce the average power consumption of the pulse oximeter consistent with a predetermined power target. In one embodiment, a calculator derives a signal status output responsive to the input signal. The signal status output is communicated to the controller to override the sampling control output. The signal status output may indicate the occurrence of a low signal quality or the occurrence of a physiological event. In another embodiment, the sensor interface has an emitter driver adapted to provide a current output to an emitter portion of the sensor. Here, the sampling control output determines a duty cycle of the current output. In a particular embodiment, the duty cycle may be in the range of about 3.125% to about 25%. In another embodiment, the sensor interface has a front-end adapted to receive the input signal from a detector portion of the sensor and to provide a corresponding digitized signal. Here, the sampling control output determines a powered-down period of the front-end. A confidence indicator responsive to a duration of the powered-down period may be provided and displayed. In yet another embodiment, the pulse oximeter comprises a plurality of data blocks responsive to the input signal, wherein the sampling control output determines a time shift of successive ones of the data blocks. The time shift may vary in the range of about 1.2 seconds to about 4.8 seconds. An aspect of a low power pulse oximetry method comprises the steps of setting a power target and receiving an input signal from a pulse oximetry sensor. Further steps include calculating signal status related to the input signal, calculating power status related to the power target, and sampling based upon the result of the calculating signal status and the calculating power status steps. In one embodiment, the calculating signal status step comprises the substeps of receiving a signal statistic related to the input signal, receiving a physiological measurement related to the input signal, determining a low signal quality condition from the signal statistic, determining an event occurrence from the physiological measurement, and indicating an override based upon the low signal quality condition or the event occurrence. The calculating power status step may comprise the substeps of estimating an average power consumption for at least a portion of the pulse oximeter, and indicating an above power target condition when the average power consumption is above the power target. The sampling step may comprise the substep of increasing sampling as the result of the override. The sampling step may also comprise the substep of decreasing sampling as the result of the above power target condition, except during the override. Another aspect of a low power pulse oximetry method comprises the steps of detecting an override related to a measure of signal quality or a physiological measurement event, increasing the pulse oximeter power to a higher power level when the override exists, and reducing the pulse oximeter power to a lower power level when the override does not exist. The method may comprise the further steps of predetermining a target power level for a pulse oximeter and cycling between the lower power level and the higher power level so that an average pulse oximeter power is consistent with the target power level. In one embodiment, the reducing step comprises the substep of decreasing the duty cycle of an emitter driver output to the sensor. In another embodiment, the reducing step comprises the substep of powering-down a detector front-end. A further step may comprise displaying a confidence indicator related to the duration of the powering-down substep. In yet another embodiment, the reducing step comprises the substep of increasing the time-shift of post-processor data blocks. Another aspect of a low power pulse oximeter comprises a sensor interface adapted to receive an input signal from a sensor, a signal processor configured to communicate with the sensor interface and to generate an internal parameter responsive to the input signal, and a sampling controller responsive to the internal parameter so as to generate a sampling control to alter the power consumption of at least one of the sensor interface and the signal processor. The signal processor may be configured to generate an output parameter and the sampling controller may be responsive to a combination of the internal and output parameters so as to generate a sampling control to alter the power consumption of at least one of the sensor interface and the signal processor. The internal parameter may be indicative of the quality of the input signal. The output parameter may be indicative of oxygen saturation. In another embodiment, the sampling controller is responsive to a predetermined power target in combination with the internal parameter so as to generate a sampling control to alter the power consumption of at least one of the sensor interface and the signal processor. The signal processor may be configured to generate an output parameter and the sampling controller may be responsive to a combination of the internal and output parameters and the power target so as to generate a sampling control to alter the power consumption of at least one of the sensor interface and the signal processor. The sensor interface may comprise an emitter driver and the sampling control may modify a duty cycle of the emitter driver. The sensor interface may comprise a detector front-end and the sampling control may intermittently power-down the detector front-end. The processor may generate a plurality of data blocks corresponding to the input signal, where each of the data blocks have a time shift from a preceding one of the data blocks, and where the sampling control may determine the amount of the time shift. A further aspect of a low power pulse oximeter comprises an interface means for communicating with a sensor, a processor means for generating an internal parameter and an output parameter, and a controller means for selectively reducing the power consumption of at least one of the interface means and the processor means based upon the parameters. In one embodiment, the interface means comprises a driver means for determining the duty cycle of emitter current to the sensor, the driver means being responsive to the controller means. In another embodiment, the interface means comprises a detector front-end means for receiving an input signal from the sensor, the power for the detector front-end means being responsive to the controller means. In yet another embodiment, the processor means comprises a post-processor means for determining a time shift between data blocks, the post-processor means being responsive to the controller means. In a further embodiment, the controller means comprises a signal status calculator means for generating an indication of a low signal quality or a physiological event based upon at least one of an internal signal statistic and an output physiological measurement, and a control engine means in communications with the signal status calculator means for generating a sampling control responsive to the indication. In yet a further embodiment, the controller means comprises a power status calculator means for generating a power indication of power consumption relative to a power target, and a control engine means in communications with the power status calculator means for generating a sampling control responsive to the power indication.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to an improved iontophoresis device for treatment of epidermal tissue and other tissue having high impedance, low mucous content or other adverse electrically nonconductive characteristics. Such treatments may be used for the purpose of anesthetizing a local region of tissue or for asceptically preparing such tissue for surgery. Other uses involving a variety of ionic materials are likewise envisioned within the potential applications of the subject invention. A primary feature of this invention is the use of a pulse-width modulated DC-DC converter and appropriate feedback circuitry to provide effective and highly responsive regulation of a constant current across the electrodes. A safety cut-off circuit for protecting the patient from burns, shocks and similar adverse effects is provided to permit safe and simple operation. Inasmuch as most of the adverse effects of iontophoresis occur as a result of surges in voltage or current caused by variations of impedance across the electrodes, any suitable circuitry responsive to such changes may serve as the driving force to de-energize the current source. The present embodiment uses comparator circuitry to register impedance conditions outside a given set of parameters. Upon the occurrence of such conditions, a signal triggers a circuit which operates to shut down the current source. Various shut-down circuits are available in the art which could be utilized in connection with the de-energizing circuitry, including the triggered SCR-feedback circuit disclosed. Additional safety features of this invention comprise timing circuitry to enable an operator to pre-set the duration of current application and to provide for automatic turn off. A damping circuit is included to check sudden changes in current such as is experienced when the device is turned off after completion of the treatment. This precludes perception of adverse nervous reaction of spasm caused by nerve response to voltage variations. The physical configuration of the device includes a wearable design which allows the operator to affix the electrodes to the patient in a manner which reduces possible accidental removal prior to completion of the treatment. The applicator electrode is used as the source of ionic material by encapsulating the material in gel form in a compartment of the electrode such that the material communicates directly with the skin upon application of the treatment. The relative spacial emplacement between the applicator electrode and grounding electrode is limited to preclude an arrangement resulting in current flow across the patient&#39;s heart. The area of treatment may be marked by staining the surface of the treated tissue with a dye impregnated within the adhesive material on the contacting surface of the applicator electrode. An impression ridge may likewise be used for temporary indication of the treatment area. This automatic method of identifying the region of treatment reduces confusion during actual post-iontophoresic treatment and upon subsequent evaluations where knowledge of the exact location of the treated area is important. It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an iontophoresis device for treatment of epidermal and similar high impedance tissue. It is a further object of this invention to incorporate an automatic safety shutdown capability for de-energizing the current source of an iontophoresis device. A further object of the present invention involves the implementation of other safety and convenience devices for minimizing difficulties associated with iontophoresis treatment. An additional object of this invention is to provide a method for identifying the previous location of electrode contacts such as those utilized in medical evaluations.",

This technique may be advantageously utilized in those cases where atopical application of such substances does not result in sufficient penetration into body tissue to accomplish satisfactory effects or where tissue penetration is otherwise undesirable. Application of the electric current causes migration of the ions into the tissue to greater depths, such migration being in proportion to the duration of current application and current density. \n     Iontophoresis devices have been developed for dental treatments in applying medications, anesthetizing agents, and desensitizing ions such as strontium and flouride.

    "abstract": "The present invention is directed to an improved handle for hand carried articles, particularly articles of substantial length such as umbrellas, fishing rods and pole mounted articles, and to an accessory embodiment of the handle for use in retrofitting existing articles, to improve and simplify the user&#39;s ability to control the article with one hand while using the same hand to perform a complete range of normal functions as if the article were not being held. The present invention provides a structure for handles which engages the fingers of a user&#39;s hand in a manner which permits the article to be held in a position of normal use while simultaneously freeing the fingers and thumb to do work which could not otherwise be accomplished while holding the article in a conventional manner. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Umbrellas and similar articles are normally held in one hand by placing the handle against the palm and wrapping the fingers and thumb around the handle. This grasping action, which is necessary to hold such an article upright in a position of use, completely occupies the fingers and thumb of the hand being used for this purpose to the exclusion of any other activity, such as writing and handling keys, mail, or other articles. In the particular case of umbrellas it is often desirable to be able to use both hands to accomplish a task while simultaneously holding the umbrella above one&#39;s head to provide shelter from rain. One example of such a task is the sorting of mail by letter carriers while on their rounds. It is extremely difficult to both hold an umbrella and handle letters and packages so that both the letter carrier and the mail remain sheltered from the rain. In addition, anyone who has attempted to juggle packages, keys and an umbrella while attempting to open a car door, will appreciate the difficulty inherent in such activities when it is raining. Other attempts to provide support for an umbrella while freeing the hands have been cumbersome, impractical or ineffective. In this regard, the umbrella handle attachment of U.S. Pat. No. 3,756,259, Beehler, is noted. This device comprises a removable, self-adjusting strap which slides onto an umbrella handle so as to provide a binding element for the user&#39;s hand which fits between the strap and the umbrella handle. However, the flexible nature of the strap together with its two point attachment only at its ends, allows the strap to &#34;give&#34; such that the umbrella can wobble or pivot about the hand. Only by maintaining two or more fingers curled around the handle in the normal manner can the umbrella be securely held and prevented from swaying relative to the user&#39;s hand. Other devices have been suggested which are in the nature of clamps to secure an umbrella to a person&#39;s arms or shoulders, or to an object being carried or pulled by the user, such as a letter carrier&#39;s mail bag or cart. All of these devices have significant drawbacks including excessive complexity, difficulty in use, incomplete umbrella coverage, and the like. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved handle which permits one to securely hold or support an article while simultaneously freeing the fingers and thumbs to perform other tasks. It is a further object of the present invention to provide an accessory handle which can be attached to an existing handle of an article and which permits one to securely hold the article while simultaneously freeing the fingers and thumbs to perform other tasks. It is a still further object to provide an umbrella having an improved handle which permits one to securely hold an umbrella while simultaneously freeing the fingers and thumb to perform other tasks. Further objects and advantages will become evident from the accompanying description and drawings. The present invention provides an improved handle for hand carried articles, such as umbrellas, fishing rods, signs and the like, comprising an elongated body having an upper end and a lower end, a central channel extending longitudinally through the body which is adapted to receive an elongated shaft of an article on which the handle is mounted and rigid finger engaging means extending from the body perpendicular to the longitudinal axis thereof and in linear alignment therealong. The finger engaging means has at least one aperture adapted to receive at least one finger of the hand therethrough, whereby the handle, and the article on which it is mounted, are stabilized in an upright position on the fingers and against the hand, and are thereby held steady while permitting the user to manipulate other articles with the fingers and thumb. The present invention further provides an improved umbrella comprising an elongated shaft having an upper end and a lower end, a plurality of articulated ribs pivotally joined to the shaft about the upper end, a flexible canopy attached to the ribs, a mechanism for articulating the ribs to open and close the canopy and a handle attached to the lower end of the shaft and extending in substantial longitudinal alignment with the shaft, wherein the improvement comprises rigid finger engaging means joined to and extending from the handle perpendicular to the longitudinal axis thereof and in linear alignment therealong. The finger engaging means has at least one aperture adapted to receive at least one finger of the hand therethrough whereby the umbrella is maintained in a position of use on the fingers and against the hand while the fingers are free and may be simultaneously used to manipulate other articles. In addition, the present invention provides an accessory handle for mounting on the handles of articles. The accessory handle comprises an elongated handle engaging portion having a substantially concave inner surface and a substantially convex outer surface, the inner surface being adapted to closely engage the existing handle, rigid finger engaging means extending perpendicularly from and linearly along the outer surface, and attachment means to secure the accessory handle to the existing handle, whereby the accessory handle provides a means whereby the article can be held steady in a position of use on the hand while permitting the fingers and thumb of that hand to manipulate other articles.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to a syringe device and, more particularly, to a non-reusable retractable syringe having an automatically retracting hypodermic needle to prevent reuse of the syringe. A method for delivering fluid to a patient and retracting the needle within the syringe after the fluid is delivered is disclosed. (2) Description of Problems and the Prior Art Many communicable diseases are commonly spread by contacting bodily and/or medicinal fluids of an-infected person, reuse of hypodermic syringes is one of the most common causes of such contact. Various mechanisms are provided in medical facilities for the disposal or destruction of syringes and hypodermic needles after usage. However, it is not uncommon for a medical worker to be scratched or punctured by a needle after usage and before disposal, resulting in injury and exposure to disease. Accordingly, there exists a need to protect personnel from accidental skin injuries from such contaminated needles, as well as the need to provide a safe and efficient means for disposing of the needles themselves. There has been increased emphasis in designing hypodermic syringes with extendible shields which protect and project over the needle area after injections are completed. Such devices often involve manual manipulation of the shield over the needle after the injection is completed. It follows that when the shield is manually extended over the needle, the operator&#39;s hands or fingers may come into contact with the tip of the needle, thus causing risk of infection. To correct this problem, many devices have built-in biasing means which provide a shield over the needle after the injection is completed. In U.S. Pat. No. 5,053,010, entitled &#34;Safety Syringe with Retractable Needle&#34;, issued Oct. 1, 1991, there is shown and disclosed an improved safety syringe with retractable needle which allows retraction of the needle into a hollow plunger by additional forward pressure on the plunger after fluid is driven from the syringe into the patient. The syringe includes a hollow plunger which is inserted into one end of a cylindrical barrel and a hollow needle attached to the other end of the barrel. Biasing means are attached to the barrel for biasing the needle towards the hollow plunger, and means are provided for releasing the needle into the hollow plunger by applying additional forward pressure upon the plunger after the plunger is telescopically contracted relative to the barrel. This design, as well as others which are commercially available, provide a plunger which is made of a plastic material, such as polypropylene, which is manufactured by known techniques. Typically carried thereon is a sealing element which is made of a comparatively soft elastomeric material, which forms the seal between the housing and the moving plunger, to prevent leakage therebetween of the fluid to be injected. The design disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,053,010 incorporates a sliding elastomeric seal which displaces from its forward position to a retracted position, thereby allowing additional forward travel of the plunger to actuate the retraction mechanism. However, with this configuration, the soft nature of the seal depicted could allow it to slide prematurely during an injection. Increasing the stiffness of the sealing member would reduce the tendency to slide prematurely, but at the expense of the seal integrity. There is need for an improved design of syringe in which an elastomer or other relatively soft seal can be used to provide maximum sealing integrity while also permitting sufficient pressure to be applied through the device to complete the injection, and thereafter to permit a cutter operatively associated with the plunger to continue to travel to cut the seal and, in turn, initiate retraction of the needle into the device after completion of the injection. Moreover, it has been found desirable to prevent telescopic expansion of the plunger relative to the barrel of the device after activation of the retraction mechanism to assure that the needle tip cannot easily be re-exposed through withdrawal of the plunger. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a non-reusable retractable safety syringe. A cylindrical barrel is provided which has first and second barrel ends and an inside diameter wall there between. A chamber is provided for receipt of fluid within the barrel and between the first and second barrel end. A plastic hollow plunger is fully extendible into the barrel and is inserted into the first end of the barrel. The plunger is selectively movable from expanded position toward and placeable into an expended position. Thereafter, the plunger may be moved to a fully collapsed position relative to the second end of the barrel. A hollow needle is secured relative to the second end of the barrel. Biasing means are provided in an initially secured relationship relative to the second end of the barrel for biasing the needle toward the hollow plunger. Means are provided for directing forward pressure upon the plunger, and sealing means include an elastomeric sealing member which is engaged to one end of the plunger for slidable sealing engagement with the inside diameter wall of the barrel. A cutting tip is provided and is carried by the plunger for cutting through the sealing member such that the biasing means releases the needle into the plunger when the plunger is at the fully collapsed position relative to the second end of the barrel. The plunger may also include the sealing means which is engaged to one end of the plunger when the plunger is in the expanded and expended positions, as well as when the plunger is moving toward the collapsed position, with the sealing means being disengageable from one end of the plunger during movement of the plunger toward, but prior to, the plunger being placed at the collapsed position. The syringe may comprise one of a number of engaging means for securing the plunger relative to the sealing means. Fluid is drawn into the syringe through the needle. The needle is then implanted into the patient and the medication delivered via one-handed force applied to one end of the plunger--moving the plunger and sealing means to the expended position. While or after removing the needle from the patient, additional one-hand force is applied to the plunger to move the plunger into the collapsed position. As the plunger collapses, the cutting tip extends through the sealing means and then through the needle retaining element to thereby release the biased needle into the plunger element of the device.",

    "abstract": "This invention is directed to synthesizing the leads of an electrocardiogram (“ECG”) from three measured leads belonging to the set of routinely used leads, including the standard 12-lead ECG, and to visually present a body surface map (“BSM”) based on an n-lead ECG that is derived from three measured leads, and to predict the development of pathology, including acute myocardial infarction (more commonly known as a “heart attack”) using the calculation of the ECG eigenvalues. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The ECG is a record of the electrical activity of the heart that is a commonly used diagnostic screening test in many medical settings. The standard ECG record includes 12 lead waveforms, denoted as I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, and V6, arranged in a specific order that is interpreted by a physician using pattern recognition techniques. The ECG is acquired by specially trained technicians using specialized hardware and equipment. In the usual configuration, 10 electrodes are placed on the body torso to measure the electrical potentials that define the standard 12 leads. Other lead systems have been tested over the years. These include the Frank vectorcardiogram (“VCG”) system, which uses 3 nearly orthogonal leads denoted as X, Y, and Z; 4 right chest leads, denoted by V3R, V4R, V5R, and V6R; and 3 left posterior leads, denoted as V7, V8, and V9. No single manufacturer currently makes equipment that allows for the acquisition of all 22 leads. In order to acquire these leads, the technician must first remove the lead clips attached to the standard electrode placement sites and then re-attach them on the electrodes placed on the non-conventional sites. This requires at least 3 separate tracing acquisitions and a total of 21 electrode placements. It is usual in the practice of medicine to place patients with potential cardiac abnormalities on a rhythm monitor, a specially designed hardware equipment that displays only one ECG lead but which has the capability of measuring 3 different leads. There are some manufacturers who have designed rhythm monitors that can display three leads as well but the usual display format is still one lead. With this equipment, the patient has 3 to 4 electrodes placed on the body torso to acquire the 3 different lead configurations. While the patient is connected to the rhythm monitor, if a standard 12 lead ECG is ordered, the technician will then place all of the additional electrodes for the separate acquisition of the ECG. Thus, the efficiency of acquiring an ECG would be improved if there existed a process by which the standard 12 lead ECG, the 3 lead VCG, the 4 right chest leads, or the 3 left posterior leads could be acquired instantaneously on demand from the rhythm monitor rather than the usual ECG machine, using fewer than standard number of electrodes. Nicklas, et al., in U.S. Pat. No. 5,058,598, invented a system for synthesizing ECG leads based on developing a patient-specific transform. This system could synthesize a 12 lead ECG based on receiving data from 3 leads. However, this system required first acquiring a complete n-lead ECG from a patient in the usual manner in order to compute a patient specific transformation, which would then be applied subsequent ECG data acquired from that patient. This is cumbersome, as the resulting transformation is applicable to only one patient and needs to be stored in a medium that must be accessible for use during the patient&#39;s hospital stay. In addition, the Nicklas transformation may also have a time dependency, indicating that the patient transform may change with time such that the transformation may need to be re-computed for each subsequent encounter with that patient for diagnostic accuracy. Dower, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,850,370, used the Frank VCG 3 lead system to derive the 12 lead ECG, however, this system is not conventional and is unfamiliar to most clinical staff. Dower also developed another unconventional lead configuration known as the EASI system, but this configuration requires the acquisition of 4 leads to derive the 12 lead ECG. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention solves the aforementioned problems by using the mathematical techniques of abstract factor analysis and the simplex optimization algorithm to derive a universal transformation matrix that is applicable to all patients and is independent of time. This universal transformation matrix is thus applicable when needed and does not require the acquisition of a complete n-lead ECG for each patient prior to its implementation. In order to do this, one first measures and digitizes the voltage-time data for some set of ECG leads to define an ECG training set. Without limitation, examples of lead sets include the following formats: 12 leads: I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6;   15 leads: I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, X, Y, Z;   15 leads: I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, V9;   16 leads: I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V3R, V4R, V5R, V6R;   18 leads: I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, V9, X, Y, Z;   19 leads: I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, V9, V3R, V4R, V5R, V6R;   22 leads: I, II, III, aVR, aVL, aVF, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, V8, V9, V3R, V4R, V5R, V6R, X, Y, Z.",

    "abstract": "The object lifting, pulling and digging apparatus of this disclosure has features that overcome many of the disadvantages associated with current pulling and digging apparatus. The apparatus can be easily attached by a universal quick attach hitch to the loader arms of a vehicle having an auxiliary hydraulic circuit. For example, the apparatus can be easily attached to the loader arms of a “skid steer” type vehicle. The apparatus has a base with opposite front and rear surfaces. The rear surface of the base is removably attachable to the loader arms of a vehicle having an auxiliary hydraulic circuit. A first jaw and a second jaw of the apparatus are attached to the front surface of the base. A first pin connects the first jaw to the front surface of the base for pivoting movement of the first jaw about the first pin between an open position and a closed position of the first jaw relative to the base. A second pin connects the second jaw to the front surface of the base for a pivoting movement of the second jaw about the second pin between an open position and a closed position of the second jaw relative to the base. The first pin and the second pin are positioned on the base in a single, generally vertical plane. The first jaw extends from the first pin to a distal end of the first jaw. The second jaw extends from the second pin to a distal end of the second jaw. Thus, the majority of the lengths of the first jaw and second jaw are positioned forwardly of the first pin and second pin. The first jaw and the second jaw have proximal end portions that extend rearwardly from the first pin and the second pin, respectively. A single hydraulic actuator is connected between the proximal end portions of the first jaw and the second jaw. The actuator is controlled to move to its retracted condition to cause the first jaw and the second jaw to move to their open positions. The actuator is controlled to move to its extended condition to cause the first jaw and the second jaw to move to their closed positions. With the actuator positioned rearwardly of the first pin and the second pin, the actuator is at a protected position behind the lengths of the first jaw and the second jaw and is not exposed to the pulling and/or digging environment of the apparatus. The proximal end portions of the first jaw and second jaw are also provided with gear teeth sections. The gear teeth sections of the first jaw and second jaw mesh between the first pin and the second pin. The meshing of the gear teeth sections synchronizes the movements of the first jaw and second jaw as they are moved between their open positions and their closed positions, and between their closed positions and their open positions. The first jaw is also provided with a generally vertically oriented first set of saw teeth. The first set of saw teeth project upwardly from the length of the first jaw. The second jaw is also provided with a generally vertically oriented second set of saw teeth. The second set of saw teeth project upwardly along the length of the second jaw. The first and second sets of saw teeth are configured to saw through the roots of trees, bushes, etc. when the apparatus is used for digging. The first jaw is also provided with a key tab that projects from the distal end of the first jaw toward the second jaw. The second jaw is provided with a key hole or key slot at the distal end of the second jaw. When the first and second jaws are moved to their closed positions for a digging operation, the key tab engages in the key slot to securely attach the distal ends of the first and second jaws together and prevent their moving vertically relative to each other during a digging operation. The first jaw has a straight section of gripping teeth that extend along a substantially straight line as the straight section of teeth extend from the distal end of the first jaw toward the proximal end of the first jaw. The second jaw also has a straight section of gripping teeth that extend along a substantially straight line as the straight section of teeth extend from the distal end of the second jaw toward the proximal end of the second jaw. The straight section of gripping teeth on the first jaw and the straight section of gripping teeth on the second jaw mesh with each other when the first jaw and the second jaw are moved to their closed positions. The first jaw has a curved section of gripping teeth that extend from the straight section of gripping teeth on the first jaw toward the proximal end of the first jaw. The curved section of gripping teeth on the first jaw extend along a curved line as they extend from the straight section of gripping teeth on the first jaw toward the proximal end of the first jaw. The second jaw is also provided with a curved section of gripping teeth that extend from the straight section of gripping teeth on the second jaw toward the proximal end of the second jaw. The curved section of gripping teeth on the second jaw extend along a curved line as they extend from the straight section of gripping teeth on the second jaw toward the proximal end of the second jaw. The curved section of gripping teeth on the first jaw and the curved section of gripping teeth on the second jaw allow larger objects, for example larger diameter posts or larger diameter trees to be engaged between these sections of teeth near the proximal ends of the jaws and closer to the loader arms of the vehicle for maximizing pulling force.

    "abstract": "Provided is a method that provides both spatial and temporal control of the degradation process using mono- and multifunctional macromolecular monomers (“macromers”) that degrade via single- and multi-photon photolysis mechanisms over a broad range of wavelengths. The macromers can form or be incorporated into networks via covalent, non-covalent and/or ionic interactions. These networks can controllably degrade both spatially and temporally. More specifically, provided is a photodegradable macromer, comprising: (a) a photodegradable group; (b) a backbone structure comprising one or more repeating units that may be the same or different, which backbone structure is attached to the photodegradable group directly or through a linker; (c) one or more reactive end groups at one or more ends of the macromer; and optionally, (d) one or more therapeutic agents; and optionally (e) one or more caged groups. Also provided are polymers and networks incorporating macromers of the invention and optionally other substituents such as other polymeric structures. Also provided is a method of controlled degradation of a polymer comprising: providing a photodegradable polymer as described herein and exposing the photodegradable polymer to photoradiation of the appropriate wavelength and energy to cause one or more of the photodegradable groups to photodegrade. As used herein, “photodegradable group” is a group that breaks one or more bonds in response to exposure to radiation of the appropriate wavelength and energy. The appropriate wavelength and energy is easily determinable by one of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation such as by the use of an absorbance spectrum to determine what wavelength(s) will cause photodegradation. The degradation of the photodegradable group does not need a photosensitizer, although a photosensitizer may be used if desired. The use of the invention with a photosensitizer is easily performed by one of ordinary skill in the art without undue experimentation. Single- or multi-photon photolysis can be used to photodegrade the photodegradable group. A broad range of wavelengths may be used for photodegradation, for example, those wavelengths in the ultraviolet spectrum, visible and infrared spectrum (between about 180 nm and 1.5 μm, for example) and all individual values and ranges therein, including UV-A (between about 320 and about 400 nm); UV-B (between about 280 and about 320 nm); and UV-C (between about 200 and about 280 nm). Other useful ranges include the radiation from visible, near-IR and IR lasers (about 500 nm to about 1.5 μm). All individual wavelengths and all intermediate ranges therein are intended to be included in this disclosure as if they were each listed separately. Examples of photodegradable groups include those groups having the structure:",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to protecting bales from the deteriorating affects of an outdoor environment, and more specifically relates to protective coverings for bales. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION One widespread method of storing forage crops is to package them in large cylindrical bales. Much of the appeal of this practice comes from the bales&#39; inherent ability to shed rainfall and other elements. Contrary to widely held perceptions however, losses due to weather exposure on round bales are quite high. In research trials carried out in the eastern United States, large round bales stored outside without protection for six months or more were commonly found to experience dry matter losses of 30 percent or greater. Numerous solutions to reduce these storage losses have been proposed, with various degrees of success. These solutions include wrapping the circumference of a bale with twine or plastic net or film material, covering the top of the bale with plastic “caps”, or the complete envelopment of the bale in plastic film. None of these methods work to reliably prevent crop loss in dry hay baling, but the complete envelopment process has shown to be successful in baling high moisture hay or silage. Concerning crop loss in dry hay baling, absorption of rainfall and/or wicking of soil moisture creates most losses due to spoilage, mold, etc. Losses from complete or circumferential solid film wrapping results from internal moisture trying to escape from the relatively dry hay, then condensing as it hits the plastic. This condensed moisture results in exterior portions of the bale remaining damp for extended periods of time, causing spoilage in these outer layers. Such spoilage has been shown to be similar to unprotected bales in some studies. The problem to be solved then is to provide a protective covering for a bale which effectively prevents crop loss from the environment while being cost effective. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, there is provided a covering for a bale which overcomes the problems of the prior art coverings. An object of the invention is to provide a wrapping which will shed essentially all liquid water while allowing water vapor given off by the crop to escape freely without condensation. Materials for accomplishing this are commonly referred to as being semi-permeable and include thin films of certain plastics, micro perforated plastic film, Tyvek®, Gortex®, and other woven or bonded fiber materials. In many, perhaps essentially all cases, application of at least one wrap of semi-permeable material should protect the exterior of the bale of crop from water penetration while allowing the water vapor leaving the crop to escape freely. It is another object of the invention to provide a bale covering which will provide additional protection to the bottom of the bale from the possibility of ground water or soil surface moisture. This is done by providing an area of overlapped wrapping material or other means of making the bottom portion of the wrap essentially impermeable to moisture. The permeability of some plastic materials diminishes with the number of layers and/or the thickness of the plastic sheets. In the case of micro perforated plastic sheets, the permeability depends on the number and size of the perforations and diminishes with additional layers because of the misalignment of perforations. Therefore, it is proposed that when micro perforated plastic sheeting is used, the region of the bale, which is to be in ground contact, would be wrapped with an additional layer of plastic with the combined layers of plastic resulting in a covering which is essentially impermeable to moisture. When an additional layer of wrapping material is placed on the bale in a region of the bale that is to be placed onto the ground, it may be desirable to mark the bale in a region opposite to that to be placed in ground contact so as to aid in the bale being moved, either by the bale discharge arrangement or by a device separate from the baler, to the correct position for storage. These and other objects of the invention will be evident from a reading of the ensuing description together with the appended drawings.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to tennis teaching aids and, more particularly, to a device useable on a tennis court in combination with a standard tennis net and tennis net posts to encourage players to routinely hit the ball over the tennis net. (2) Description of the Prior Art In playing tennis, balls are hit over the tennis net from one side of the court to the other. It is necessary to hit the ball over the tennis net but still keep it within the confines of the end line. A problem that occurs is tennis players tend to try to hit the ball too close to the top of the tennis net which often results in hitting the net. Various inventions have been employed to improve the accuracy of the tennis player hitting tennis balls above the tennis net. One such invention is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,436,304 to Castleman et al. in which a white band is placed a distance above the tennis net. The player then uses the white band as a target to accurately keep the ball in play. A problem with this invention is that players can hit the ball above or below the white band to keep the ball in play which in turn makes it ineffective as a teaching aid. It also encourages aiming for the band and not the back of the court. It is an object of my present invention to improve a tennis player&#39;s accuracy in placing the ball within the tennis court by rewarding the tennis player only when he or she hits the tennis ball a safe minimum distance above the tennis net. A further object of my invention is to make the player aware of the fact that the top of the net was never meant to be a target. Rather it is a minimum height the ball must attain in addition to landing within the confines of the court. There is no limit on the height the ball can attain as long as it lands within the confines of the court. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,243,221 to Ferreira-Godinho, 4,204,679 to Kreuzman and 3,966,205 to Schain et al. all disclose apparatuses to improve a tennis player&#39;s game and more particularly the serve, but all require extensive hardware and/or modified existing structure. U.S. Pat. No. 3,993,306 to Scott discloses a tennis target structure that straps to the side of the tennis net. This makes it difficult to align the target with respect to the tennis net. Thus, it is another object of the present invention to provide a device that can easily be aligned with and attached to an existing tennis pole and tennis net structure so that tennis players can improve their game on an existing tennis court. Another object of the present invention is to provide a device which is simple in construction, inexpensive, easy to install and simple to operate. Other objects of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment and from the accompanying drawings. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The tennis net height extender of the present invention is adapted to be used with a regulation tennis net and tennis net posts situated within a tennis court. It includes a pair of auxiliary tennis net posts each having at least one open faced slot extending from a bottom end of the auxiliary tennis net posts for permitting a cable attached to the tennis net to pass therethrough. The auxiliary tennis net posts are equipped with devices that permit them to be releasably fastened to the tennis net posts so that they extend thereabove and are adjustable therewith. An auxiliary tennis net is provided and is fastened to the auxiliary tennis net posts in overlapping relationship to the permanent net.",

    "abstract": "The invention relates to a method and a device for feeding layers of tobacco to an intermediate reservoir. The invention relates more particularly to a method and device for feeding layers of tobacco to a box for cut ribs and stems. 2. Description of the Related Art Tobacco products, especially cigarettes, are typically composed of many different grades of tobacco and thus for the quality of these tobacco products a consistent fidelity in blend is substantial on the basis of the large amounts of tobacco to be processed in preparing the tobacco so that each and every cigarette contains a constantly homogenous tobacco blend. If, for this purpose, a proportion of a certain grade of tobacco necessary for a specific blend were to be fed directly to the blending box from a silo, layers of tobacco would result in the blending box greatly differing in homogeneity to such a degree that the wanted homogeneous quality of the finished tobacco product would be unfavorably influenced. That is why it is important in satisfying the basic requirement that the large blending boxes as known in the tobacco industry are filled with differing grades of tobacco in such a way that the various grades of tobacco are deposited by layers in such a blending box so that the lengths of the individual layers correspond to the length of the blending box. Then, from the tobacco mass thus formed, vertical portions are removed containing tobaccos of various layers and thus various grades of tobacco to generate a homogenous blend of tobacco. Thus, various devices have been developed, intended assure the consistent stratification in such blending boxes, see e.g. DE 20 24 513 A, U.S. Pat. No. 4,619,576 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,811,585. A further problem associated with such a blending box is that the tobacco needs to be fed equally apportioned for further processing. For this purpose it is usually such that at the outlet end of the blending box so-called sweeper rakes are installed which acts as rotating spiked shafts and which are provided with spikes to tear the vertical tobacco portions from the face wall of the tobacco mass in the blending box. This allows this particular tobacco to be supplied for further processing. However, discharging the layers of tobacco in this way from the blending box greatly stresses the tobacco, degrading it accordingly. This applies in particular to cut tobaccos having a high moisture content which in critical bulk heights and lengthy storage periods tend to pack and clump so that discharge by means of sweeper rakes results in heavy detriment to qualify. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention is thus based on the object of defining a device and a method for feeding an intermediate reservoir with layers of tobacco in which the aforementioned disadvantages do not occur. More particularly, the object is to define a device and a method permitting by simply designed means the discharge of homogenous tobacco portions from the blending box without quality being detrimented in any way. This object is achieved by a device for feeding layers of tobacco to an intermediate reservoir more particularly, to a box for cut ribs and stems, comprising a blending trolley arranged above said intermediate reservoir, said blending trolley being reciprocable in the longitudinal direction of said intermediate reservoir, said blending trolley receiving a continual feed of tobacco and a continual stream of tobacco dropping from the discharge end of said blending trolley downwardly into said intermediate reservoir, a conveyor for the further transport of the tobacco mass present in said intermediate reservoir to a dosing apparatus and web-type separators in the drop path of said tobacco between said blending trolley and said intermediate reservoir for deflecting said dropping stream of tobacco so that predetermined break points form in said tobacco mass under said separators thus forming vertical columns of tobacco separable from each other. The object is achieved also by a method for feeding layers of tobacco to an intermediate reservoir, more particularly, a box for cut ribs and stems, including feeding a continually falling, horizontally shifting stream of tobacco to said intermediate reservoir, wherein said falling stream of tobacco is deflected by a web-type separators, below said web-type separators predetermined break points form in said tobacco mass in said intermediate reservoir, forming vertical columns of tobacco separable from each other. There are also further embodiments of the device read from the features as set forth in the dependent claims. The advantages achieved by the invention are based on the following mode of functioning: The stream of tobacco falling vertically from a blending trolley in conventional ways and is deflected by web-type separators located above the intermediate reservoir, usually a blending box, so that in the vertical direction under these web-type separators, zones of lesser tobacco density materialize in all tobacco layers in the intermediate reservoir. These zones of lesser density have the effect of being &#34;predetermined break points&#34; in the tobacco mass so that these predetermined break points produce vertical columns of tobacco separated from each other, comprising different layers and thus grades of tobacco. On discharge of the tobacco mass from the intermediate reservoir the first tobacco column in the discharging direction tilts away and is thus supplied as a sole, separated portion to further processing, for example a dispensing conveyor. The tobacco mass in the intermediate reservoir is thus subjected to no mechanical agitation whatsoever so that masses of tobacco heavily compacted and tending to lump due to critical bulk heights and lengthy storage may be supplied apportioned to further processing in a gently treated manner. Particularly in the case of cut rib and stem tobacco processing needs to be done in the presence of a high moisture content, this being the reason why the invention is especially suitable for the application of cut rib and stem tobacco blending bins or silos, also hereinafter termed a &#34;shag box&#34;.",

    "abstract": "The present invention provides methods of preparing calcium/oxyanion-containing particles, including apatites and apatite precursors, using a microfluidizer. The particles thus prepared, are for use in medical diagnostic imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging, X-ray, and ultrasound applications. The desired calcium/oxyanion-containing particles are synthesized, passed through a microfluidizer, and purified to remove excess base, salts, and other materials used to synthesize the particles. The microfluidizer causes two high pressure streams to interact at ultra high velocities in a precisely defined microchannel. Use of the microfluidizer results in significant reduction in the average particle size. Purifying the particles, preferably using tangential flow filtration, as well as coating the particles, improves particle stability. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING FIG. 1 is a graphical representation of the particle size distribution of manganese-doped hydroxyapatite particles prepared according to Example 8, before and after passing through a microfluidizer. FIG. 2 is a graphical representation of the osmolality of a particulate suspension after sequential passes through a tangential flow filtration system as described in Example 8. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present, invention provides methods for preparing calcium/oxyanion-containing particles, including apatites and apatite precursors, especially hydroxyapatite, having uniform, small (&lt;5 μm) particle size and uniform distribution through use of a microfluidizer. As used herein, calcium/oxyanion-containing particles include calcium phosphate minerals, apatites, and apatite precursors of the general formula Ca n  M m  X r  Y s , where M is a paramagnetic metal ion, radiopaque metal ion, radioactive metal ion, or stoichiometric mixture of metal ions, X is a simple anion, Y is an oxyanion including tetrahedral oxyanions, protonated or unprotonated, carbonate, or mixtures thereof, m is from 0 to 10, n is from 1 to 10, s is &gt;1, and r is adjusted as needed to provide charge neutrality. As used herein, apatite precursors include compounds within the scope of the above general formula having one or more amorphous phases which, when sintered, may become crystalline apatites. Possible paramagnetic metal ions which can be used in the calcium/oxyanion-containing particles of the present invention include: chromium(III) , manganese(II) , iron(II), iron(III), praseodymium(III), neodymium(III), samarium(III), ytterbium(III), gadolinium(III), terbium(III), dysprosium(III), holmium(III), erbium(III), or mixtures of these with each other or with alkali or alkaline earth metals. Certain radiopaque heavy metals, such as bismuth, tungsten, tantalum, hafnium, lanthanum and the lanthanides, barium, molybdemnn, niobium, zirconium, and strontium may also be incorporated into particles to provide X-ray contrast. Typical simple anions which can be used in the calcium/oxyanion-containing particles of the present invention include: OH -- , F -- , Br --  I -- , 1/2[CO 3   2--  ], or mixtures thereof. The tetrahedral oxyanions used in the present invention may optionally include radiopaque metals or radioactive metals. Suitable tetrahedral oxyanions are nonoxidizing and stable to hydrolysis. Examples of suitable tetrahedral oxyanions for use in the present invention include: PO 4   3-- , AsO 4   3-- , WO 4   2-- , MoO 4   2-- , VO 4   3-- , Sio 4   4-- , and GeO 4   4-- , and when stable protonated forms of these. Phosphate is a currently preferred tetrahedral oxyanion. By controlling the particle size, organ specific imaging or therapy of the liver or gastrointestinal tract is obtained. When apatite particles having a size in the range from about 5 nm to about 5 μm are injected into the vascular system, the particles collect in the liver or spleen (the RES system) because a normal function of these organs is to purify the blood of foreign particles. Once the particles have collected in the liver or spleen, these organs may be imaged by the desired medical diagnostic imaging technique. Depending on the diagnostic imaging technique, calcium/oxyanion containing particles are treated to be paramagnetic, radiopaque, or echogenic. For example, paramagnetic metal species may be incorporated into the particles to improve magnetic resonance contrast, and radiopaque species may be incorporated to provide X-ray contrast. Particle density, and corresponding echogenic characteristics, can be controlled to impart low or high acoustic impedance relative to blood. The calcium/oxyanion-containing particles may also be fluorinated to form stable, nontoxic compositions useful for  19  F imaging. The presence of a paramagnetic metal species in these particles may reduce  19  F and proton relaxivity, thereby enhancing MRI, MRS, or MRSI. Hydroxyapatite doped with a paramagnetic metal can be prepared by mixing a basic (pH 10-12) phosphate solution with a calcium/paramagnetic metal solution at native pH. It has been found that the paramagnetic ions incorporated into the apatite particle tend to oxidize during particle synthesis. To prevent metal oxidation the amount of oxygen in the aqueous reactant solutions is minimized. Oxygen minimization is obtained by synthesis at high temperature, such as 100° C. or by degassing the aqueous reactant solutions with an inert gas such as argon, nitrogen, or helium. Antioxidants, such as gentisic acid and ascorbic acid, added during or after apatite particle synthesis may also be used to prevent metal ion oxidation. Reducing agents, such as NaBH 4 , have been found to reduce metal ions that are unintentionally oxidized during apatite particle synthesis. Paramagnetic particles may also be prepared by adsorbing paramagnetic metal ions onto the particle. For example, manganese can be adsorbed to hydroxyapatite particles by taking a slurry of hydroxyapatite and adding Mn(NO 3 ) 2  with stirring. Applying energy, such as ultrasonic power or heat, to the resulting mixture may also facilitate the reaction. The resulting mixture can be separated by either centrifugation and decantation or by filtration. Any excess manganese may be removed by washing with large amounts of water. The manganese adsorbed particles can then be stabilized against oxidation and particle agglomeration with a suitable coating agent. The same procedure may be used with other paramagnetic cations. The amount of manganese adsorbed onto the particle surface, as a percentage of the total calcium in the particle, is in the range from about 0.1% to about 50%. Such particles exhibit very high relaxivities and rapid liver enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging studies.

    "full_text": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n     It has been postulated for many years that mammalian cardiac atria serve as sensors that are important in detecting changes in extracellular fluid volume (Gauer et al., Physiol, Rev. 43:423, 1963). Such a receptor function for the cardiac atria is known in the case of vasopressin, the hypothalmic hormone important in regulating the osmotic concentration of the body fluids. \n     The postulated existence of a substance which would enhance urinary sodium excretion, and hence be involved in regulation of extracellular fluid volume, was demonstrated recently. de Bold et al., Life Sci. 28:89, 1981, injected a partially purified extract of cardiac atria of rats into other anesthetized rats and observed a large increase in urine flow and in urinary sodium excretion. This relatively crude extract possessed the appropriate characteristics of an endogenous natriuretic substance. \n     In addition to its potent diuretic and natriuretic effects, properties that ma...",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a method of supplying the energy needs to animals, particularly to domestic animals including ruminants, and the feeds to be used for this method. 2. Description of the Prior Art It is well known that to cover the energy demands of ruminants and other domestic animals, fat can be used in limited quantities only. Furthermore, the common types of fats, whose melting point lies below that of the body temperature of the animal, can only be fed with the ration in quantities of a maximum of 5%, otherwise the animal&#39;s digestive process is considerably disturbed. Another way of feeding fat is in the form of emulsions containing fat particles measuring 10 to 50μm, (Swiss Patentschrift No. 456 010; Lang &amp; Uzzan, &#34;Les Corps Gras en Poudre: Preparation, Proprietes, Utilisations&#34;, Corps Gras en Poudre, No. 6, June 1975, pages 327 to 335). Likewise, however, this form of fat supply also causes disorders of the digestive process--in the omasum and especially in the rumen--if considerable quantities are fed. It is general knowledge that fats which melt at high temperatures, i.e., above about 50° C., suffer in digestibility at a progressively greater rate as the melting point is increased. This has been confirmed by A. Rosenberg in his U.S. Pat. No. 3,011,0892. In order to overcome this difficulty, Rosenberg has suggested the use of fat mixtures of very specific composition including one or more liquid oils that have not been hydrogenated. fat is said to have good digestibility with chicks when fed flakes which may be up to 2 mm in thickness and up to 5 mm in diameter. It was held that the size of such particles is not critical.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to an improved heating pad which has been found to be useful for therapeutic applications, and more particularly to an improved radiant therapeutic heater. 2. Description of the Prior Art Certain types of painful conditions of the muscles or joints such as arthritic pain often have the application of heat prescribed to relieve the pain. Heat is normally applied in a variety of ways, for instance by the use of irritant rubbing compounds which cause local stimulation of blood vessels thereby increasing body heat carried to the location, the use of infrared lamps, the use of radio frequency apparatus such as diathermy machines, the use of hot water bottles or electrically operated heating pads. While some or all of the aforenoted apparatus is alleged to work to some degree, all have certain disadvantages. For instance, the prolonged use of an infrared heating lamp can cause localized burning of the skin. Diathermy machines are specialized apparatus which require expensive skilled operators. Irritant rubs, while apparently generating local heat, sometimes irritate the skin. Hot water bottles maintain an uneven temperature with time, generally are applied too hot to the skin, and later cool to an ineffective temperature. They are thus uncomfortable for most of their time of application. Prior art heating pads are generally comprised of insulated electrical heating elements held within a sealed bag, covered with a washable removable cloth envelope. Such heating pads are resistance heated by the flow of electricity therethrough, which heat the surrounding insulated envelope. The pad is applied to an area of the body which is to be treated, and the hot pad provides fairly even heat to the skin. However the use of this form of heating pad must be carefully controlled. Since the pad heats the skin by conduction from the heating coils to the body of the user, it feels generally hot to the touch, and use must be limited or the skin can be burned, particularly if the user falls asleep on the pad. Due to the conduction of heat to the skin, the pad eventually begins feeling very uncomfortable. While such pads generally utilize thermostats to control the amount of heat generated, its use in a confined space, such as under the patient, generally causes the build up of heat on the skin which is conducted directly from the heating coils. The heat has been found to eventually become uncomfortable even at a generally low thermostatic setting. An improvement over conventional heating pads can be found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,186,294 (“the &#39;294 Patent”) which issued on Jan. 29, 1980, of common assignee to the present invention, the contents of which are incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Briefly, the &#39;294 Patent discloses a therapeutic heating pad which operates using black body radiation of infrared heat, rather than conduction as in conventional pads. The surface temperature of the pad exceeds the temperature of the human body, somewhat, but because of its unique design the heat is dissipated and it does not feel uncomfortably hot to the touch. It can, as a result be used for extended periods of time. Yet the radiant heat generated by the pad has been found to penetrate tissue relatively deeply, thus providing an enhanced therapeutic effect. This is accomplished without the previously encountered hot or burning feeling on the skin of a user. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is directed to a novel form of electrically operated heating pad. The invention, in general, is a radiant therapeutic heater comprising a radiant heat generating layer having a plane surface comprising means for radiating heat evenly from its surface, a pair of flexible electrically insulating and radiation permeable layers located adjacent and covering opposite sides of the layer, a thermal insulation layer disposed against and covering one of the electrically insulating layers, and a sealed radiation permeable envelope enclosing the entire heater. The flexible heat generating layer is comprised of a foam insulation layer impregnated with a resistive material, which material provides a surface temperature, when current is conducted therethrough, which is in the range of about 54 degrees Celsius. The heating pad of the present invention may also include a stiffener to protect the heating element from damage due to bending or creasing of the pad.",

    "abstract": "Applicants have discovered that tumor formation in a patient can be treated or prevented by administering to the patient an antigen-presenting cell(s) that is loaded with antigen encoded in RNA derived from a tumor. For convenience, an RNA-enriched tumor preparation can be used in lieu of purified RNA. The invention thus circumvents the need purify RNA or isolate and identify a tumor antigen. Using similar methods and pathogen-derived RNA, pathogen infection in a patient can be treated or prevented. The RNA-loaded antigen-presenting cells can be used to stimulate CTL proliferation ex vivo or in vivo. The ex vivo expanded CTL can be administered to a patient in a method of adoptive immunotherapy. Accordingly, the invention features a method for producing an RNA-loaded antigen-presenting cell (APC); the method involves introducing into an APC in vitro (i) tumor-derived RNA that includes tumor-specific RNA or (ii) pathogen-derived RNA that includes pathogen-specific RNA (e.g. tumor-specific RNA of an intracellular pathogen), thereby producing an RNA-loaded APC. Upon introducing RNA into an APC (i.e., “loading” the APC with RNA), the RNA is translated within the APC, and the resulting protein is processed by the class I processing and presentation pathway. Presentation of RNA-encoded peptides begins the chain of events in which the immune system mounts a response to the presented peptides. Preferably, the APC is a professional APC such as a dendritic cell or a macrophage. Alternatively, any APC can be used. For example, endothelial cells and artificially generated APC can be used. The RNA that is loaded onto the APC can be provided to the APC as purified RNA, or as a fractionated preparation of a tumor or pathogen. The RNA can include poly A +  RNA, which can be isolated by using conventional methods (e.g., use of poly dT chromatography). Both cytoplasmic and nuclear RNA is useful in the invention.. Also useful in the invention is RNA corresponding to defined tumor or pathogen antigens or epitopes, and RNA corresponding to “minigenes” (i.e., RNA sequences encoding defined epitopes). If desired, tumor-specific or pathogen-specific RNA can be used; such RNA can be prepared using art-known techniques such as subtractive hybridization against RNA from non-tumor cells or against related, but non-pathogenic, bacteria or viruses. The RNA that is loaded onto APC can be isolated from a cell, or it can be produced by employing conventional molecular biology techniques. For example, RNA can be extracted from tumor cells, reverse transcribed into cDNA, which can be amplified by PCR, and the cDNA then is transcribed into RNA to be used in the invention. If desired, the cDNA can be cloned into a plasmid before it is used as a template for RNA synthesis. Such techniques allow one to obtain large amounts of the RNA antigen from a small number of cells, which is particularly advantageous because tumor patients often have few tumor cells. In one embodiment, the APC are contacted with the tumor-derived RNA in the presence of a cationic lipid, such as DOTAP or 1:1 (w/w) DOTMA:DOPE (i.e., LIPOFECTIN). Alternatively, art-known transfection methods are used to introduce the RNA into the APC. Because practicing the invention does not require identifying an antigen of the tumor cell or pathogen, RNA derived from essentially any type of tumor or pathogen is useful. For example, the invention is applicable, but not limited, to the development of therapeutics for treating melanomas, bladder cancers, breast cancers, pancreatic cancers, prostate cancers, colon cancers, and ovarian cancers. In addition, the invention can treat or prevent infections with pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella, Enterobacter, human immunodeficiency virus, Herpes virus, influenza virus, poliomyelitis virus, measles virus, mumps virus, or rubella virus. The antigen-presenting cells produced in accordance with the invention can be used to induce CTL responses in vivo and ex vivo. Thus, the invention includes methods for treating or preventing tumor formation in a patient by administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of APC loaded with tumor-derived RNA. The tumor-derived RNA can be derived from the patient, e.g., as an RNA-enriched tumor preparation. Alternatively, the tumor-derived RNA used in such a treatment regimen can be derived from another patient afflicted with the same, or a similar, type of cancer. Likewise, APC loaded with pathogen-derived RNA can be used to treat or prevent a pathogen infection in a patient. Included within the invention are methods for producing a cytotoxic T lymphocyte. Such a CTL can be produced by contacting a T lymphocyte in vitro with an antigen-presenting cell that is loaded with tumor-derived or pathogen-derived RNA, and maintaining the T lymphocyte under conditions conducive to CTL proliferation, thereby producing a CTL. The resulting CTL show remarkable specificity for the pathogen or the cells of the tumor from which the loaded RNA is derived. Such CTL can be administered to a patient in a variation of conventional adoptive immunotherapy methods. The invention also includes methods for treating or preventing tumor formation in a patient by administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of APC loaded with tumor-derived RNA. Similarly, the invention provides methods for treating pathogen infection in a patient by administering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of APC loaded with pathogen-derived RNA. The T lymphocytes that are used in these various therapeutic methods can be derived from the patient to be treated, or haplotype-matched CTL from a donor can be used. Similarly, the RNA used in these methods can be derived from the patient to be treated, or RNA from a donor can be used. By “RNA-loaded” or “RNA-pulsed” antigen-presenting cell is meant an APC (e.g., a macrophage or dendritic cell) that was incubated or transfected with RNA, e.g., RNA derived from a tumor or pathogen. Such RNA can be loaded onto the APC by using conventional nucleic acid transfection methods, such as lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation, and calcium phosphate transfection. For example, RNA can be introduced into APC by incubating the APC with the RNA (or extract) for 1 to 24 hours (e.g., 2 hours) at 37° C., preferably in the presence of a cationic lipid. By “tumor-derived” RNA is meant a sample of RNA that has its origin in a tumor cell, and which includes RNA corresponding to a tumor antigen(s). Included is RNA that encodes all or a portion of a previously identified tumor antigen. Similarly “pathogen-derived” RNA is a sample of RNA that has its origin in an pathogen (e.g., a bacterium or virus, including intracellular pathogens). Such RNA can be “in vitro transcribed,” e.g., reverse transcribed to produce cDNA that can be amplified by PCR and subsequently be transcribed in vitro, with or without cloning the cDNA. Also included is RNA that is provided as a fractionated preparation of tumor cell or pathogen. Because even unfractionated RNA preparation (e.g., total RNA or total poly A+ RNA) can be used, it is not necessary that a tumor or pathogen antigen be identified. In one embodiment, the preparation is fractionated with respect to a non-RNA component(s) of the cell in order to decrease the concentration of a non-RNA component, such as protein, lipid, and/or DNA and enrich the preparation for RNA. If desired, the preparation can be further fractionated with respect to the RNA (e.g., by subtractive hybridization) such that “tumor-specific” or “pathogen-specific” RNA is produced. By “tumor-specific” RNA is meant an RNA sample that, relative to unfractionated tumor-derived RNA, has a high content of RNA that is preferentially present in a tumor cell compared with a non-tumor cell. For example, tumor-specific RNA includes RNA that is present in a tumor cell, but not present in a non-tumor cell. Also encompassed in this definition is an RNA sample that includes RNA that is present both in tumor and non-tumor cells, but is present at a higher level in tumor cells than in non-tumor cells. Also included within this definition is RNA that encodes a previously identified tumor antigen and which is produced in vitro, e.g., from a plasmid or by PCR. Alternatively, tumor-specific RNA can be prepared by fractionating an RNA sample such that the percentage of RNA corresponding to a tumor antigen is increased, relative to unfractionated tumor-derived RNA. For example, tumor-specific RNA can be prepared by fractionating tumor-derived RNA using conventional subtractive hybridization techniques against RNA from non-tumor cells. Likewise, “pathogen-specific” RNA refers to an RNA sample that, relative to unfractionated pathogen-derived RNA, has a high content of RNA that is preferentially present in the pathogen compared with a non-pathogenic strain of bacteria or virus. The invention offers several advantages. Vaccinations performed in accordance with the invention circumvent the need to identify specific tumor rejection antigens or pathogen antigens, because the correct antigen(s) is automatically selected from the tumor- or pathogen-derived RNA. If desired, the risk of generating an autoimmune response can be diminished by using tumor-specific RNA. In addition, vaccination with cells loaded with unfractionated tumor-derived RNA likely elicits immune responses to several tumor antigens, reducing the likelihood of “escape mutants.” The invention also extends the use of active immunotherapy to treating cancers for which specific tumor antigens have not yet been identified, which is the vast majority of cancers. The invention can be used efficaciously even if the tumor itself displays poor immunogenicity. In addition, the invention is useful for reducing the size of preexisting tumors, including metastases even after removal of the primary tumor. Finally, the invention offers the advantage that antigen-presenting cells that are loaded with in vitro transcribed RNA can be more potent vaccines than are antigen-presenting cells that are loaded with peptide antigens.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to horticulture and more particularly to the growth and development of plants, especially the root portions thereof, in a generally gaseous environment into which a nutrient-containing mist is introduced. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Aeroponics, or the growth of plants in air has been known for some time. F. W. Went describes experimental apparatus for growing plant roots in a vaporized nutrient in a publication entitled &#34;The Experimental Control of Plant Growth&#34; (1957) Chronica Botanica Co. Waltham, Mass. at pages 81-83. Even earlier, in a publication entitled &#34;A Method of Growing Plants in Water Vapor to Facilitate Examination of Roots&#34;, Phytopathology Volume 32 pages 623-625, 1942, W. A. Carter described apparatus for growing plants with their roots in water vapor. More recently, in an article entitled &#34;Method for Growing Plants Aeroponically&#34;, in Plant Physiology (1976) Vol. 57, pages 344-346, Zobel et al describe an experimental growing box employing a rotating spinner for mist generation. The above publications, extending over more than 30 years, all relate to experimental devices designed to permit examination and relatively free access to plant roots for treatment, all within a research context. Aeroponics, until the present, has been confined to the laboratory and has not been conceived of or developed heretofore as a commercial technique for facilitating and enhancing plant growth and development. A number of cogent reasons why plants should be grown commercially outside of a soil environment have long existed. A major problem particularly in the growth of flowers are diseases which reach the plant via the soil. For example, bacteria such as Fussarium, present in certain soils, causes disease in Carnation plants. Other examples of plant diseases which arise from soil contact are Botrytis, Sclerotium, Verticilium and Rhizoctonia. Further difficulties connected with soil borne diseases are the difficulty of diagnosing and treating the plants and particularly the root portions thereof due to the relative inaccessibility thereof in the soil. Other difficulties arise in connection with plants which require special and specific treatment to enhance their growth. For example, in the case of orchids, it has been found desirable to supply certain hormones to the growing plants in order to enhance their development. The application of such hormones to such plants in a soil environment is rendered difficult and relatively expensive due to the relatively large quantity of material required, arising from the fact that such hormones must be administered indirectly, via the soil. Hydroponics, or the growth of plants in water, has been known for some time and has been the subject of much experimental investigation. Hydroponics has not however achieved acceptance for commercial scale plant growth and development. One problem often involved in hydroponics is the lack of adequate ventilation at the roots due to the substantially continuous presence of water thereabout. Hydroponic plant growth apparatus employing a liquid spray has been proposed in the patent literature. U.S. Pat. No. 4,059,922 discloses a sprayer hydroponic grower in which potted plants are mounted on a supporting frame defining a spray enclosure. The pots are apertured to permit the spray to wet the root portions of the plants and to provide nutrients thereto. The roots of the plants are supported within the pots by a porous medium such as peat and thus the majority of the roots are not directly exposed to the atmosphere and to the spray. As a result of the retention of moisture by the porous medium, spray is provided only two or three times during a 24 hour period. The fact that the roots are in the main not directly exposed to the atmosphere is believed to have negative implications with regard to root diseases. U.S. Pat. No. 2,431,890 discloses a method and receptacle for propagating plants and relates particularly to cuttings to which a spray of water is applied to facilitate the development of roots. U.S. Pat. No. 3,768,201 discloses a method of sprouting beans which employs a water spray which is governed by a timer. The beans to be sprouted are disposed in a container having an apertured bottom for draining and the water is recirculated. German Offenlegungsschrift No. 2,351,508 describes a plant growing method in which plants are matured from seed which is placed in a porous root permeable base. As the plant develops, the roots extend outwardly of the root permeable base. The base is mounted on a support frame such that the base and the exterior roots are exposed to a liquid spray. The porous root permeable base shares the apparent disadvantages of the pots of U.S. Pat. No. 4,059,922, in that a portion of the roots is not exposed to the atmosphere and to the spray and thus becomes susceptible to root disease. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention seeks to overcome difficulties associated with the growth and development of plants in accordance with conventional techniques and in accordance with the proposals found in the patent literature and to provide apparatus and methods for commercial scale growth and development of plants with substantially all of their roots in a gaseous environment. There is thus provided in accordance with an embodiment of the invention apparatus for aeroponic growth and development of a multiplicity of plants comprising at least one perforate plant development unit including at least one perforate plant support member adapted to secure plants above the root portions thereof and thereby to directly expose substantially all of the root portions to the atmosphere; spraying collection and recirculation apparatus for providing a nutrient mist directly to the root portions; and comprising control apparatus for determining the timing and duration of mist provision. Further in accordance with an embodiment of the invention, the control apparatus is operative in response to sensed environmental conditions in the vicinity of the growing plants, to govern the timing of mist provision. The mist provision apparatus may be driven by a liquid pump or alternatively may comprise a relatively low pressure pneumatic sprayer operating as a venturi pump. This latter arrangement has the advantage that it enables a central compressor to be employed to service a number of development units, while at the same time isolating the liquid flows in the units to inhibit the possible spread of disease. Additionally, the nutrient liquid may be pasteurized to inhibit disease and may be maintained at an elevated temperature so as to enable it to be used to regulate the temperature inside the growth units. In accordance with one embodiment of the invention, there is provided a generally gas-tight enclosure substantially surrounding at least the root portions of the plants and apparatus for introducing a desired gaseous atmosphere to the enclosure.",

The present invention also provides use of melatonin in the manufacture of a medicament for the prevention or treatment of symptoms of hypertension in a patient who is resistant to the antihypertensive effect of an antihypertensive compound administered in absence of melatonin, as well as a method for the prevention or treatment of symptoms of hypertension in a patient who is resistant to the antihypertensive effect of an antihypertensive compound administered in absence of melatonin, which comprises administering melatonin to such patient, in an amount effective to ameliorate or prevent symptoms of hypertension developing in the patient. According to another aspect, the invention provides use of melatonin in the manufacture of a medicament for imparting in a patient at least one effect selected from improvement in mood and daytime vigilance, postponement of the peak level of cortisol in the patient and potential prophylactic protection against the detrimental effects of ischemia on the heart, the medicament being a pharmaceutical formulation which comprises melatonin in an amount effective to impart at least one of the above-stated effects.

The expression “improvement in mood” in the present context is intended to connote avoidance of mood depression which may be associated with administration of melatonin in conventional form, i.e. not in controlled release form. Surprisingly, administration of melatonin to humans appears to lower excretions rates and diurnal variations.

    "abstract": "This invention relates to receptacles, such as beverage receptacles, which are constructed substantially of an elastomeric material such that the receptacles are fully eversible and resilient. Beverage receptacles can be difficult to clean, as an inherent consequence of the basic shape requirements. In particular, the beverage contacting surface is not amenable to manual washing, as the interior surface is recessed and difficult to contact. This is particularly the case for beverage receptacles which often contain powdered drinks, such as baby formula or protein powder. Nursing bottles, for example, often need to be washed with an extended scrubbing brush which is capable of accessing the inner recesses of the receptacle. Failure to properly clean the inner portion of a beverage receptacle can result in microbiotic growth, and illness for subsequent users of the receptacle. Various solutions to these problems have been proposed by those skilled in the art. For example, see U.S. Published Application No. 2009/0108009; Japanese Published Application No. JP200393477; PCT Published Application No. WO2012/115491; Korean Publication No. 1020110024959; U.S. Pat. No. 8,267,271; U.S. Pat. No. 5,591,110; PCT Published Application No. WO2010/121800; and a commercialized product sold under the name of TIGEX (http://www.tigex.com/uk/content/reversible-cup). While each of these products appears suitable for its intended purpose, none of these configurations provide a satisfactory solution to the need for a simple and effective way to expose an interior surface of a container for cleaning and drying purposes. Thus, there has been a long felt, unresolved need for a receptacle which provides facile access to, washability and drying of, the inner, or beverage-contacting, surface. A beverage receptacle for easy cleaning and drying can include at least one sidewall contoured to define an open end. The sidewall can be manufactured substantially of an elastomeric material, such that the receptacle can be fully eversible as well as resilient. The receptacle can be transformed, via eversion, between two stable conformations. The first stable conformation can be suitable for containing a beverage, or other substance, and the second stable conformation can expose the beverage contacting surface, thereby facilitating cleaning and drying. The receptacle can be resilient, having the capability of maintaining shape in either stable conformation. When in the first stable conformation, the receptacle can be capable of standing upright without assistance. A receptacle for containing a substance can include at least one sidewall defining a container with a predetermined volume for housing the substance to be contained. The at least one sidewall can include a first substance-contacting surface. The container can be reversibly eversible, such that the container reversibly transforms between a first stable conformation with the substance-contacting surface facing inward and a second stable conformation with the substance-contacting surface facing outward. A rigid sleeve can at least partially sheath the container and have at least one sidewall-pull-down cutout removing a portion of the sleeve allowing for a second surface of the sidewall to be exposed when in the first stable conformation. The at least one sidewall can be accessed during eversion to facilitate interaction of the at least one sidewall with respect to the sleeve. A receptacle for containing a substance can include at least one elastomeric sidewall defining a container having a first surface. The container can be reversibly eversible between first and second stable conformations. The first stable conformation can be defined by the first surface facing inward and the second stable conformation can be defined by the first surface facing outward. The at least one elastomeric sidewall can have resilience and sufficient yield strain to prevent permanent deformation and fatigue failure of the elastomeric sidewall after repeated eversions. A rigid sleeve can at least partially sheath the container and have at least one eversion cutout created in the sleeve allowing for a second surface of the sidewall to be exposed when in the first stable conformation. Pressure can be directly applied to the at least one elastomeric sidewall to additionally facilitate removal from the sleeve and eversion of the container. A receptacle for containing a substance can include a container including a contiguous containment wall defining an open end. The contiguous containment wall can have a first surface. The containment wall can be composed substantially of an elastomeric material. The containment wall can be reversibly eversible to transform between a normal stable conformation with the first surface facing inward and an everted stable conformation with the first surface facing outward. A buckle region of the containment wall can extend at least partially along a periphery of the container adjacent a lower portion of the container allowing the buckle region to strategically deform making eversion of the container easier. A rigid sleeve can at least partially sheath the container. The buckle region ( 26   a ) can include a decoupling point defined by at least one protrusion extending outward from the second surface when the container is in the first stable conformation. A decoupling ledge can be formed on the sleeve mating with the at least one protrusion when the container is in the first stable conformation. The sleeve can include at least one eversion cutout created in the sleeve allowing for a second surface of the containment wall to be exposed. Pressure can be directly applied to the containment wall to additionally facilitate in eversion. At least one containment-wall-pull-down cutout can remove at least a portion of the sleeve allowing for the second surface of the containment wall to be exposed. The at least one containment-wall-pull-down cutout allows the containment wall to be accessed through the sleeve during assembly and disassembly of the containment wall with respect to the sleeve during eversion to facilitate interaction of the containment wall with respect to the sleeve. The sleeve can define an interstitial space between the sleeve and a second surface of the containment wall allowing stagnant air to be trapped therebetween to provide insulation. A capping element can be provided to reversibly cover an open end of the receptacle. The capping element can be reversibly joined to the open end of the receptacle by an attachment joint to create a fluid tight seal between the open end of the receptacle and the capping element. The receptacle can sometimes be referred to herein as a “container” or a “containment element”. The receptacle can define an easily cleanable nursing bottle, including an eversible sidewall forming the receptacle, a nipple shaped capping element, and an attachment member. The receptacle, when in the first stable conformation, can be filled with a fluid or liquid such as milk or baby formula, and the nipple can be reversibly attached to the receptacle for drinking. When the receptacle is emptied of fluid or liquid contents, the nipple can be removed from the receptacle and the receptacle can be everted to the second stable conformation. The beverage contacting surface can then be easily and thoroughly cleaned, e.g. with a soapy sponge. The containment element can also define an easily cleaned or dried general use beverage receptacle, such as can be used for a sports drink or a protein shake. The beverage receptacle can include an eversible receptacle, a rigid cap with a drinking opening, and an attachment member. Additional features can be included on the attachment member, bottle, or both to increase the ease of eversion. These features can be applied to all bottle types inclusively. Other applications of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art when the following description of a possible mode contemplated for practicing the invention is read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",

The present inventors have investigated various organic phosphorus pesticides and found that the 2-phenylimino-tetrahydro-1,3-thiazine-3-phosphonic acid esters (I) have potent pesticidal activities with low toxicities against human beings or animals. This invention is based on these findings. The definitions in the above formulae will be explained in more detail as follows. The group attached by the term &#34;lower&#34; in the definitions means a group having not more than 6 carbon atoms, especially not more than 5 carbon atoms, unless the term is particularly defined. &#34;The lower alkyl&#34; means straight or branched chain saturated hydrocarbon residue, in particular C 1  -C 5  alkyl. Examples of the lower alkyl are methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, tert-butyl, pentyl, isopentyl, tert-pentyl, neo-pentyl, 1-methylbutyl, 1,2-dimethylpropyl, hexyl, and the like. &#34;The lower alkoxy&#34; means a group formed from the above lower alkyl and a bivalent oxygen.

    "abstract": "This invention relates to a light duty and weight, combination floor vacuum cleaner, duster and upholstery and stair tread cleaner. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A variety of different dry type vacuum cleaners are available for a variety of uses ranging from heavy duty rug and carpet cleaners, light duty rug and carpet cleaners for picking small spills and crumbs, compact hand held cleaners for cleaning cushions, pillows, stair treads and the like. There have also been developed such cleaners particularly designed or equipped with conversion tools to be used for special purposes such as removal of spider webs near the ceiling and adjusting drapery valances and the like. In recent years due to the introduction of plastics and substantial improvements in the design of the electric motors for this type of equipment, the bulk and weight of these machines has been reduced substantially. Also, the development of compact rechargeable, heavy duty batteries has made possible the so-called cordless vacuum cleaner. However, there has remained the problem that the machines were limited to one or two functions. For other functions it has been necessary to have a second tool or a bulky and clumsy conversion kit. An example of a basically single function, floor cleaning vacuum cleaner not suitable for use with cushions or well adapted for cleaning valances or removal of cobwebs close to the ceiling is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. Des. 280,033, issued Aug. 6, 1985 to Isshin Miyamoto et al. Other examples of a basically single purpose machine are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,011,624 issued Mar. 15, 1977 to Mark A. Proett and U.S. Pat. No. Des. 274,381 issued June 19, 1984 to Lawrence I. Chiu. In both cases, these machines could be used to remove a floor spill but the use would require the operator to stoop or to kneel on the floor, either of which is inconvenient at best, and for some people, physically impossible. The necessity for having different machines available to satisfy the needs of different circumstances is expensive and for many people creates a problem with storage space. It can also be frustrating when part way through a particular job one finds that a second and different tool is necessary to complete it. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Through a unique &#34;tool within a tool&#34; and &#34;handle within a handle&#34; construction, the invention provides, in a single machine a vacuum cleaner which, without the need of a conversion kit or tray of accessories functions as a full height floor vacuum, a compact hand held upholstery cleaner and a machine having the ability to be used for cleaning out of reach surfaces and objects such as valances. When used as a standard upright, there is no necessity for the user to stoop or kneel. By removing the carpet head, which is simply a pull apart operation, the machine is converted to use for cleaning valances and difficult to reach areas such as ceilings and the like. This simple conversion is made possible by the fact that the insertion port where the carpet head is inserted into the apparatus is itself configured as a cleaning tool. Thus, the carpet head tool is mounted within another too, making conversion of the apparatus from one type of cleaner to another very simple and direct. By unlatching and removing the handle, the machine is converted into a compact, hand held vacuum cleaner for cleaning upholstery, furniture cushions and stair treads. This is made possible by making one end of the machines primary body a handle for the machine when using as a compact hand held unit and also as the anchor for the handle extension used when the machine is adapted to floor or ceiling use. Thus, one handle which creates one type of machine is removably mounted within another handle which, when the first handle is removed, creates a totally different type of machine.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a method of preparing a freeze-dried preparation of human growth hormone. BACKGROUND OF INVENTION By recombinant DNA technology a great number of therapeutic proteins are produced and marketed. Dependent on the protein conformation and/or posttranslational modification a number of different host cell systems are used. Thus proteins like insulin, glucagon, factor VII and human growth hormone (hGH) are produced recombinantly. Following expression the desired proteins are purified, typically by use of a number of chromatographic operations and by means of precipitations. Precipitates can be crystalline or amorphous. The final product achieved by a purification procedure is typically called bulk material to be used for the following formulation of the product. It is desirable to obtain crystalline bulk materials because crystals are well defined and easy to dissolve facilitating the following formulation procedure. Crystals are often stable and can therefore be stored safely before use. Amorphous precipitates are typically achieved by precipitation at the isoelectric point in the presence of organic solvents such as ethanol in order to increase the yield, or by means of salting-out procedures by addition of ammonium sulphate. hGH has previously been isoprecipitated as an amorphous solid. However, it is generally difficult to redissolve amorphous hGH completely. To achieve total dissolution it is necessary to use denaturing buffers such as guadinium chloride or urea. Experience has shown that it is very difficult to crystallize hGH. HGH can be co-crystallized with zinc ions giving small crystals (European Patent No. 540 582: Growth Hormone Crystals and a Process for Production of these GH-Crystals, Applicant: Novo Nordisk A/S, Inventors: Junker, J.; Skriver, L.). However, formulations of hGH typically do not have the presence of zinc ions. Therefore, before formulation, hGH co-crystallized with zinc has to be redissolved and a buffer change has to be performed. A solid hGH product—SOMATROPIN—is mentioned in pages 1518-1521 of the 1997 European Pharmacopoeia (1997:0951). How to prepare this bulk material is not mentioned and only specifications are stated. In 1997, Overcashier et al. (Overcashier D. E. et al., Jour. Pharm. Sci. 86(4):455-459 (1997)) published an article describing the preparation of excipient-free recombinant human tissue-type plasminogen. The article states that precipitation of proteins by pH adjustments (iso-precipitation) or ionic strength regulation often leads to denaturation of the proteins resulting in reduced therapeutic activity. A method based on lyophilization of the protein from the ammonium bicarbonate was described. It was shown that the freeze-drying procedures took place in two steps. A large pressure increase was observed in the procedure when water was removed, and it was suggested that ammonium bicarbonate was evenly distributed over the lyophilization product. The following sublimation of ammonium bicarbonate resulted in a decomposition into water, carbon dioxide and ammonia which gave rise to the mentioned pressure increase. Thus, in the presence of ammonium bicarbonate it can be technically difficult to perform the freeze-drying procedure which might give reproducibility problems for the solid bulk material. In 1998, Senderoff et al. (Senderoff, R. I. et al., Jour. Pharm. Sci. 87(2):183-189 (1998)) described a method to achieve excipient-free GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1). It starting material was obtained by reverse phase chromatography in ethanolic acetic acid buffers followed by isoprecipitation, resolubilisation and a first lyophilization. However, redissolution in neutral buffer systems was highly unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the conformation was different from that of a standard. To improve dissolution and to achieve the correct conformation (stability) the first lyophilisate was reprocessed in three different ways: 1) Wash followed by lyophilization of a slurry. 2) Resolubilisation in 0.05 M ammonium hydroxide followed by lyophilization. 3) Resolubilisation in 6 M urea 1% acetic acid—reverse phase chromatography—cation exchange chromatography, elution with 0.05 M ammonium hydroxide—lyophilization. To compare the conformations of the lyophilised GLP-1 products infrared spectroscopy was used . Only procedure 3 resulted in a product that could readily be resolubilised completely and had the same conformation as that of a standard preparation. The other methods showed considerable conformational deviations from that of the standard and unsatisfactory dissolution properties. In spite of the above teachings it has now surprisingly been shown that a single lyophilization of a slurry of an amorphous hGH precipitate in an aqueous system (free of buffer components) at the isoelectric point resulted in a product with a minimal content of degradation products in terms of deamidation, dimers, polymers, etc. and also with a correct tertiary structure as determined by NMR spectroscopy. Additionally, the product was readily soluble in neutral buffers and full biological activity was encountered. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a method for preparing a readily soluble freeze-dried solid preparation of hGH with a minimal content of degradation products in terms of deamidation, dimers, polymers, and sulphoxide forms, the method comprising a single lyophilization of an aqueous slurry of an amorphous hGH isoprecipitate, the slurry being essentially free of buffer components and having a pH of or near to the isoelectrical point of hGH (pH about 5). The present invention further provides a readily soluble freeze-dried solid preparation of hGH with a minimal content of degradation products in terms of deamidation, dimers, polymers, and sulphoxide forms, obtainable by a method comprising a single lyophilization of an aqueous slurry of an amorphous hGH isoprecipitate, the slurry being essentially free of buffer components and having a pH of or near to the isoelectrical point of hGH.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to methods of implanting artificial hairs in human tissue. The invention relates also to devices useful for methods of implanting artificial hairs in human tissue, and to artificial hairs implanted. 2. Description of the Prior Art Hair transplanting techniques have been known in the field of dermatology. Hair transplantation is a process of removing tufts of hair and their follicles from one place and implanting them in another on the same body. According to this dermatological approach, however, hairs cannot be transplanted without their follicles, and transplanting of other&#39;s hair or animal hair will bring about rejection in the recipient tissue. In place of natural hair transplantation, the use of artificial hair implanted on a cloth has become popular. This approach, however, is far from ideal because of the fact that the hair-implanted cloth, which is bonded to the skin, easily comes off due to spoil by secretions on the skin and due to elasticity disagreement between the cloth and the skin. This type of substitute is useful but for temporary purposes only. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the invention to provide a technique for firmly implanting artificial hairs directly under the epidermis of a human body without causing rejection in the recipient tissue. It is another object of the invention to provide a device for implanting artificial hairs directly in the dermal or hypodermal tissue. It is still another object of the invention to provide artificial hair suited to be implanted directly under the epidermis. With these and other objects in view, the invention provides an artificial hair implanting method in which a needle is used to thrust one end of an artificial hair into the dermal or hypodermal tissue and fix it there. To prevent the implanted hair from falling, the hair has a root at its implanted end which turns back as the needle advances, thus serving as a stopper for the hair. For this purpose, the needle has its point shaped for holding an artificial hair at the root to allow the root to be firmly retained in position when the needle is withdrawn. Thrusting the root into the skin will cause the outer skin to be broken radially. The area of broken skin, or virtually a tiny spot of cut, is restored perfectly in a few days. In the process of restoration, the tissue about the root and the bottom of the hair implanted is reinforced to hold the hair with a strength greater than a force required to pull out a natural hair from the scalp. The artificial hair used for the purpose of the invention is of a thermoplastic resin such as nylon and polyacrylonitrile resin. A monofilament of 0.06 to 0.10 mm in diameter is spun out of a material resin by usual melt-spinning and drawing processes. The root is formed of the same resin and connected to the filament by a suitable bonding agent or thermal melting. The root may be formed by heating an end of the filament. The heated part, when cooled, sets up a root. The root is preferably 1.0 to 2.0 mm in length and 0.20 mm in diameter. The hair-implanting needle used for the purpose of the invention has its point shaped like a fork to hold the neck of the root. The needle may be a pipe permitting the passage of the hair excepting the root. Needles of other shapes may also be used. For example, the point of the needle may be branched like the nose of a pair of pincers.",

    "abstract": "This invention pertains to a tool for use in flossing teeth, and in particular, to such a tool having two opposing pairs of prongs adjustable relative to each other to vary the distance between lengths of floss received by each of the pairs of prongs. The flossing of teeth is now a generally accepted practice for cleaning teeth. The usual procedure includes sliding a tensioned string up and down against a tooth surface which is adjacent an adjoining tooth and therefore difficult to reach with a tooth brush. Flossing is usually performed by manipulating floss only with one&#39;s hands. The ends of a run of dental floss of several inches are wrapped around one&#39;s index fingers. A length of floss, extending between the fingers under tension, is then inserted into the mouth and forced between adjacent teeth to clean the corresponding tooth surfaces. This is continued until all of the desired tooth surfaces are cleaned. This involves a somewhat awkward and cumbersome process of having to insert one or more fingers inside the mouth to manipulate appropriately the dental floss. The manual procedure just described has been simplified through the use of devices which provide a pair of spaced-apart prongs, the tips of which have a length of floss extending between them. The prongs are far enough apart to allow the passage of teeth and a portion of the associated jaw without obstruction. These devices therefore provide a means for inserting a length of floss into one&#39;s mouth without having to hold the ends of the floss run, and correspondingly, without having to insert one&#39;s fingers into the mouth. Flossing by either of these methods has inherent disadvantages. One is the necessity of applying a single force against the tooth being flossed. This force must be counteracted by the person whose teeth are being flossed. Additionally, it takes several minutes to accomplish the individual flossing of all the appropriate tooth surfaces. Some people are incapable of flossing adequately his or her own teeth due to lack of training or physical coordination. If so, it is helpful to have another person floss their teeth. If done by hand, one must insert one&#39;s own fingers in another&#39;s mouth. Additionally, it is difficult to manipulate floss within the small mouth of a young person. The use of the previously mentioned flossing devices partially solves this problem by permitting the introduction of a small clean object in the mouth which is easier to manipulate. It is, however, somewhat difficult to obtain a corresponding degree of cleanliness from flossing compared to a manual system. In addition, the intermittent application of varied forces on a person&#39;s jaw can be uncomfortable to that person. It is therefore a general object of the present invention to overcome the above-described problems in the prior art. More specifically, it is an object to facilitate the expedient flossing of teeth by providing for the flossing of two tooth sides concurrently. It is also an object to provide a tooth flosser that can be used with a minimum net force being applied to a person&#39;s jaw during the flossing operation. It is thus an object to provide a flosser which flosses both sides of a tooth simultaneously, regardless of its size. It is further desired to provide such a flosser which accommodates extended circumferential tooth surface contact by the floss. It is also an object to provide such a tool which is easy to use and inexpensive to manufacture. One embodiment of this invention has a generally V-shaped handle made of a resilient material. The points of the V each have a pair of spaced-apart prongs which are structured to support, under tension, a length of floss between their extremeties. The pairs of prongs are slightly angled toward each other, with the prongs in one pair being closer together and shorter in height than the prongs in the other pair. These features allow passage of the more closely spaced prongs between the wider spaced prongs. In a second embodiment, a pair of spaced-apart prongs extend from one end of a handle at an obtuse angle relative to the handle. A second pair of prongs is joined to an arm which is disposed slidably on the handle, with this arm being extendible beyond the first pair of prongs. This second pair of prongs extends at an acute angle relative to the handle. Again, one pair of prongs is shorter and more narrowly spaced than the other to allow passage between the more widely separated prongs. Both of these embodiments provide for the concurrent use of two lengths of floss for cleaning teeth. Thus, they allow for cleaning of two tooth surfaces at a time. This may involve opposite sides of a single tooth, adjacent surfaces of adjacent teeth, or corresponding surfaces of adjacent teeth. When used to clean opposite surfaces of a single tooth or adjacent surfaces of adjacent teeth, the net horizontal force applied on a person&#39;s jaw is essentially zero, since equal and opposite forces are being applied. When the tool is used to clean both sides of a single tooth, the prong tip pairs may be moved past each other to effect a more complete wrapping of the corresponding floss lengths around the tooth surfaces. This produces a more complete cleansing of the tooth. These and additional objects and advantages of the present invention will be more clearly understood from a consideration of the drawings and the detailed description of the preferred embodiments which follow.",

Now, according to one of its aspects, the invention is characterized in that said computer means furthermore have detector means connected to said housing means as part of said user interface, and feedback actuator means controlled by said programmed computer means for imparting low-frequency primary physical interactions to said housing means as a reaction on selected ones of said simulated mechanical interactions. Traditionally, persons have undertaken to move the housing of an electromechanical pinball game for so trying to influence the motion of the runner element or ball, at the risk of producing a tilt situation. The solution according to the present invention renders the now fully electronic game to more resemble the properties of the old electromechanical game. Advantageously, secondary and ternary low-frequency interactions simulate a feedback to the user person moving the housing, both if the `tilt` threshold has not yet been reached, and also if this threshold has effectively been passed. The invention also relates to a user interface device for use with a game according to the invention. In particular, the display is arranged for simulating further said physical interactions occurring. It has been found that this lends the game an even more lively character.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to dolls and more particularly pertains to a figurine simulating a bungee jumper for suspended attachment to an automobile rear view mirror or other surface. 2. Description of the Prior Art The use of dolls is known in the prior art. More specifically, dolls heretofore devised and utilized for the purpose of simulating physical activities are known to consist basically of familiar, expected and obvious structural configurations, notwithstanding the myriad of designs encompassed by the crowded prior art which have been developed for the fulfillment of countless objectives and requirements. For example, a toy action figure and speech and sound effect accessory therefore is illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 5,073,140 which includes toy action figures and detachable accessories that incorporate audio generating apparatus. The audio generating apparatus is entirely contained within the accessory and generates both speed and sound effects. The detachable accessories have a configuration and visual appearance coordinated with the configuration and visual appearance of the toy action figure. The accessories in configuration, appearance, and sound content are made to be attachable and applicable to different types of action figures. Another patent of interest is U.S. Pat. No. 4,964,831 which discloses a collector edition doll including an outer casing having a painted face depicting an event or events in the life of the doll. A pedestal for the casing is also provided and the doll, casing, and pedestal are all hand crafted from wood and hand painted so that each is unique in its own right. In addition, each doll comes with a story sheet which details events in the life of the doll and, in particular, that event depicted on the face of the casing. Other relevant patents include U.S. Pat. Nos. Des. 283,906, U.S. Pat. No. Des. 283,520, and U.S. Pat. No. 3,611,627. While these devices fulfill their respective, particular objectives and requirements, the aforementioned patents do not disclose a figurine simulating a bungee jumper for suspended attachment to an automobile rear view mirror other surface which is provided with an elastic cord wrapped around the ankles of the figurine and coupled to a suction cup whereby excess cord may be stored within an interior cavity of the figurine. Furthermore, none of the known prior art dolls teach or suggest both a retracting assembly disposed within the interior cavity for retracting the excess cord through a rotation of the head of the figurine, and a label assembly coupled to the figurine for receiving and displaying cards having custom indicia thereon. In these respects, the suspended bungee cord doll according to the present invention substantially departs from the conventional concepts and designs of the prior art, and in so doing provides an apparatus primarily developed for the purpose of providing a figurine simulating a bungee jumper for suspended attachment to a surface. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In view of the foregoing disadvantages inherent in the known types of dolls now present in the prior art, the present invention provides a new suspended bungee cord doll construction wherein the same can be utilized for simulating a bungee jumper through the suspended attachment of a figurine to an automobile rear view mirror or other surface. As such, the general purpose of the present invention, which will be described subsequently in greater detail, is to provide a new suspended bungee cord doll apparatus which has many of the advantages of the dolls mentioned heretofore and many novel features that result in a suspended bungee cord doll which is not anticipated, rendered obvious, suggested, or even implied by any of the prior art dolls, either alone or in any combination thereof. To attain this, the present invention essentially comprises a figurine simulating an invertedly suspended human, i.e. a bungee jumper, for suspended attachment to an automobile rear view mirror or other surface. The doll is provided with an elastic cord coupled to a suction cup and wrapped around the ankles of the figurine. Storage of excess cord is provided within an interior cavity of the figurine and such cord may be dispensed therefrom to change the suspended height of the doll. Alternate embodiments of the present invention include both a retracting assembly disposed within the interior cavity for retracting the excess cord through a rotation of the head of the figurine, and a label assembly coupled to the figurine for receiving and displaying cards having custom indicia thereon. There has thus been outlined, rather broadly, the more important features of the invention in order that the detailed description thereof that follows may be better understood, and in order that the present contribution to the art may be better appreciated. There are, of course, additional features of the invention that will be described hereinafter and which will form the subject matter of the claims appended hereto. In this respect, before explaining at least one embodiment of the invention in detail, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction and to the arrangements of the components set forth in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced and carried out in various ways.

    "abstract": "A portable spa having a plurality of structural components formed from an inflatable and/or rigid material and specifically structured to be easily assembled or disassembled wherein fluid regulating and directing means are included in the spa assembly so as to provide desirable turbulence to the water maintained in a contained space within the spa. 2. Description of the Prior Art Spa assemblies, hot tub structures and like systems are well known in the prior art and have enjoyed increased popularity in recent years. In the majority of such systems, a contained space is at least partially filled with water which continuously is circulated throughout the contained space. A fluid directing structure is provided to include one or more jet streams of water directed into the interior of the contained space to create a certain amount of water turbulence. In the conventional spa assembly or system, the tub or pool-like structure is generally formed of rigid material and permanently mounted or affixed either in-ground or above-ground at a specific location. Fixed plumbing in the form of rigid material conduits, pumps, valving, heating structures, etc. are then mounted at this given location in communication with the interior of the rigid material tub or pool to create the desired treatment of water being circulated. Again, while such substantially permanent systems are extremely popular, they are considered by many consumers to be somewhat expensive. Also, such structures do not readily lend themselves to relocation and placement at a variety of locations. Therefore, such prior art structures as described above are not generally adaptable to small living quarters or where there is not sufficient indoor or outdoor space to accommodate the aforementioned relatively permanent installation. The prior art structure as described above are represented in the following U.S. Pat. Nos. to Janosko, 4,233,694; Mandell, 4,339,833; and Bonner, 4,420,846. In addition to the above, there are structures existing in the prior art which are effectively collapsible, easily storable, and therefore relatively portable for transport from one location to another. Such structures frequently are used as collapsible bathing tubs and include an inflatable structure which define a contained space in which water is placed after the structures have been inflated. While such collapsible devices are most certainly operable for their intended use, these structures are not adaptable for use as a spa wherein liquid is recirculated through a contained space by fluid directing means so as to provide intended turbulence within the water and further provide the relaxing and sometimes therapeutic affects such turbulence frequently accomplishes. United States patents representing collapsible and/or inflatable structures as set forth above are disclosed in the following U.S. Pat. Nos. to Burrow, 2,504,646; Alvarez, 2,505,845; Shill, 4,197,838; and Browning, 4,312,084. Accordingly, there is a need in the recreational industry for a portable and collapsible spa assembly capable of being located at any of a variety of locations and requiring no permanent installation and relatively little room for setup and use. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a portable spa including an inflatable base means having sufficient length and overall dimension for positioning in supported relation to occupants within a contained space. The inflatability of the base means allows it to be readily assembled and disassembled for operative use and storage and/or transport to other locations as desired by the user. A containment means preferably in the form of a flexible containment wall made of a liquid impermeable sheet material extends about the periphery of the base means and upwardly therefrom into supported engagement with a support means. The latter support means includes a support frame which also may be disposed in substantially surrounding relation to at least a portion of the contained space. The contained space is at least partially filled with water wherein such water or liquid is recirculated therethrough by entering the contained space through fluid directing means and exiting the contained space through a drain structure. A fluid regulating means in the form of a pump, a drive motor, proper valving and a heater assembly serves to continuously direct a flow of water through the fluid directing means into the interior of the contained space an therefrom, through vent means, back to the recirculating pump. The pump may be connected to a conventional supply of water such as a spigot, garden hose, hot water heater, etc. for initial filling of the contained space. Thereafter, the valving means is structured for the selective recirculation of the liquid throughout the contained space as set forth above. Further structural features of the present invention include the fluid directing means including a plurality of jet apertures formed in conduit means located or mounted on an exposed surface of the base means. The liquid from the pump means is directed through the plurality of apertures into the contained space to provide a certain amount of desirable turbulence in the liquid within the contained space and thereby provide its occupants with the benefits normally associated with such turbulence. Further structural features of the present invention include the support frame comprising an inflatable structure formed of material having sufficient rigidity to be self-supporting and upstanding from the ground or floor or surface which is generally disposed to support the entire spa assembly. Such inflatable support frame includes an interior surface which may define at least part of the aforementioned containment means and thereby define the boundaries of the contained space in which the water is placed. Another embodiment of the present invention includes the support frame formed of a rigid material such as molded plastic, chrome plated metal or other applicable material. In this embodiment, the rigid support frame is disposed in surrounding relation to an opening of the contained space and the containment means extends along a major length of the periphery of the base means and upwardly therefrom into overlapping and supported engagement with surrounding peripheral portions of the rigid support frame. A plurality of legs or like structures serve to position the rigid supporting frame in its upstanding position relative to the aforementioned supporting surface on which the entire assembly is placed. In either embodiment of the present invention the various components including the base means, and in one embodiment the support frame, is made from an inflatable structure wherein assembly and disassembly of the various components of the spa is readily accomplished. The subject spa assembly is thereby portable and readily stored or transported between a number of locations as desired by the user. The invention accordingly comprises the features of construction, combination of elements and arrangement of parts which will be exemplified in the construction hereinafter set forth, and the scope of the invention will be indicated in the claims.",

    "abstract": "The invention generally relates to blood processing systems and methods. In a more specific sense, the invention relates to systems and methods for removing leukocytes from blood components collected for therapeutic purposes. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Today blood collection facilities routinely separate whole blood into its various therapeutic components, such as red blood cells, platelets, and plasma. One separation technique that is in widespread use today uses a multiple blood bag system. The bag system includes a primary blood bag and one or more transfer bags, which are integrally connected to the primary bag by tubing. The technique collects from a donor a single unit (about 450 ml) of whole blood in the primary blood bag. The donor is then free to leave. The donor&#39;s whole blood later undergoes centrifugal separation within the primary bag into red blood cells and plasma rich in platelets. The plasma rich in platelets is expressed out of the primary bag into a transfer bag, leaving the red blood cells behind. The plasma rich in platelets then undergoes further centrifugal separation within the transfer bag into a concentration of platelets and plasma poor in platelets. The plasma poor in platelets is expressed from the transfer bag into another transfer bag, leaving the concentration of platelets behind. Using multiple blood bag systems, all three major components of whole blood can be collected for therapeutic use. However, the yield for each component collected is limited to the volume of the components that are contained in a single unit of whole blood. Furthermore, because red blood cells are retained, United States governmental regulations prohibit collecting another unit of whole blood from the donor until six weeks later. Certain therapies transfuse large volumes of a single blood component. For example, some patients undergoing chemotherapy require the transfusion of large numbers of platelets on a routine basis. Multiple blood bag systems simply are not an efficient way to collect these large numbers of platelets from individual donors. On line blood separation systems are today used to collect large numbers of platelets to meet this demand. On line systems perform the separation steps necessary to separate concentration of platelets from whole blood in a sequential process with the donor present. On line systems establish a flow of whole blood from the donor, separate out the desired platelets from the flow, and return the remaining red blood cells and plasma to the donor, all in a sequential flow loop. Large volumes of whole blood (for example, 2.0 liters) can be processed using an on line system. Due to the large processing volumes, large yields of concentrated platelets (for example, 4×10 11  platelets suspended in 200 ml of fluid) can be collected. Moreover, since the donor&#39;s red blood cells are returned, the donor can donate whole blood for on line processing much more frequently than donors for processing in multiple blood bag systems. Regardless of the separation technique used, when collecting blood components for transfusion, it is desirable to minimize the presence of impurities or other materials that may cause undesired side effects in the recipient. For example, because of possible febrile reactions, it is generally considered desirable to transfuse red blood cells and platelets that are substantially free of leukocytes, particularly for recipients who undergo frequent transfusions. Several United States Patents are directed to the removal of leukocytes from red blood cells and platelet components in multiple blood bag systems. For example, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,767,541; 5,089,146; 5,100,564; and 5,128,048. U.S. Pat. No. 5,427,695 is directed to the removal of leukocytes from platelet-rich plasma during on line blood processing. The platelet-rich suspension product obtained using prior on line blood collection systems and methods may still lack the desired physiologic characteristics imposed by the end user (typically a blood bank or hospital) for long term storage and transfusion. For example, the platelet-rich suspension may include residual leukocytes that, while very small in relation to the leukocyte population in whole blood, are still greater than the leukocyte population standards desired by the end user. Therefore, despite significant advances in blood processing technology, a need still exists for further improved systems and methods for removing undesired matter like leukocytes from blood components in a way that lends itself to use in high volume, on line blood collection environments. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The invention provides on line blood processing systems and methods for obtaining a finished platelet suspension having a desired physiologic characteristic. In a preferred embodiment, the desired physiologic characteristic comprises a desired reduced residual population of leukocytes. The systems and methods that embody features of the invention establish on line communication between a container and a source of blood containing leukocytes and platelets, such as a human donor. The systems and methods create a centrifugal field between the source of blood and the container. The centrifugal field separates from the blood an unfinished suspension of platelets having a first physiologic characteristic different than the desired physiologic characteristic. In a preferred embodiment, the unfinished platelet suspension contains an initial leukocyte population greater than the desired residual leukocyte population. According to the invention, the systems and methods pump the unfinished platelet suspension outside the centrifugal field through a finishing device. The finishing device changes the first physiologic characteristic to the desired physiological characteristic, thereby creating the finished platelet suspension. In a preferred embodiment, the finishing device reduces the leukocyte population by filtration. The systems and methods convey the finished platelet suspension from the finishing device directly into the container for storage or transfusion. The systems and methods that embody the features of the invention function without interrupting the on line communication between the container and the source of blood.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to farming. More particularly, this invention relates to toolbar implements. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The planting of corn, soybeans, and other crops is typically performed by driving a tractor through the field pulling a toolbar implement. The toolbar implement consists of a frame supported by wheels or tracks and having a transverse bar to which multiple planting units are attached. The planting units are spaced apart along the transverse bar to correspond to the seed rows that will be planted. The term “toolbar” is used interchangeably in the industry to refer to the implement as a whole and to the transverse bar specifically. As used herein, the term “toolbar” refers specifically to the transverse bar to which the planting units are attached and the term “toolbar implement” refers to the implement as a whole. Toolbar implements commonly contain toolbars having widths of twenty feet (which can accommodate eight planting units spaced thirty inches apart), thirty feet (which can accommodate twelve planting units spaced thirty inches apart), and more. The toolbars are so wide that they commonly are hinged so that the overall width of the implement can be reduced for storage and for travel upon public roads. Toolbar implements are also used in other farming operations. For example, multi-functional row units are often attached to the toolbar implement to simultaneously till (also known as cultivate or plow), plant, and fertilize in one pass through the field. This method of farming is known as strip tillage, zone tillage, or strip till farming. As used herein, the term “row unit” refers to any type of planter, tiller, multi-functional unit, or the like that is attached to a toolbar implement. Toolbar implements typically have two positions, a lower working position and an upper storage position. In the working position, the toolbar is in a lower position and the row units are in contact with the ground. In the storage position, the toolbar is in a raised, upper position and the row units are elevated off the ground. The storage position is also used when the toolbar implement is transported. A typical wheeled toolbar implement contains a main longitudinal frame having a connector at the front and a hitch at the rear. The toolbar is divided into three sections, a hinged left wing, a fixed center, and a hinged right wing. Spaced apart on the center toolbar are two, four, or more wheel assemblies. Each wheel assembly contains a bracket, a motion dampener, a lift arm, and a wheel. Row units are attached to the center toolbar in the spaces between the wheel assemblies. While wheeled toolbar implements are more common, toolbar implements containing track assemblies are becoming more popular. A track assembly for a toolbar implement is described in Rosenboom, U.S. Pat. No. 7,726,749, Jun. 1, 2010, which is incorporated by reference. Track assemblies make contact with the ground with larger surface areas (footprints) and therefore reduce soil compaction and improve the ability to operate in wet fields. One disadvantage of track assemblies on toolbar implements is that turning is more difficult, both in the field and during transport, because of the larger footprints. Another disadvantage is that many toolbar implements do not keep the lower (ground-contacting) sections of the track perfectly parallel to the ground when on a side incline. Maintaining the track assemblies parallel to the ground at all times is required for optimal stability and traction. Accordingly, there is a demand for an improved toolbar implement. More particularly, there is a demand for a toolbar implement having tracks that steer and remain parallel to the ground. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of this invention is to provide an improved toolbar implement with tracks that steer and that remain parallel to the ground. I have invented an improved toolbar implement with steering tracks for connection to a tractor and for connection of a plurality of row units. The toolbar implement comprises: (a) a main longitudinal frame; (b) a transverse axle assembly having two ends; (c) a lift arm assembly pivotably connected to the frame and pivotably connected to the axle assembly for raising or lowering the frame relative to the axle assembly, the pivoting connection of the lift arm assembly to the axle assembly defining a transverse vertical plane; (d) a control arm pivotably connected to each end of the axle, each control arm having a spindle, the pivoting connections of the control arms being in substantially the vertical plane defined by the pivoting connection of the lift arm assembly to the axle assembly; (e) a track assembly connected to each spindle; and (f) a steering mechanism extending between the control arms. The toolbar implement of this invention has steering tracks that provide many advantages over implements with non-steering tracks. The toolbar implement maintains the track assemblies in the desired parallel orientation to the ground at all times. The toolbar implement also directs the weight of the frame optimally to the track assemblies.",

    "abstract": "This and additional objects of the present application are accomplished by the various aspects of the present invention, wherein briefly, according to a principal aspect, a spherical curler is provided to enable a user to obtain a helical curl having a continuum of varying diameters within each lock of curled hair. This varying diameter helix provides a new and distinct look for the curled hair. In addition, the spherical configuration allows more curlers to be placed on the head as compared to conventional cylindrical curlers having similarly sized diameters. Also, the spherical configuration of the curler provides for less wasted space on the curler, and allows each curler to be more completely utilized for each respective lock of hair. According to a first aspect of the present invention, a hairstyling device is provided which includes a curler having a substantially spherical body. The body includes at least one receptable disposed therein for receiving a shaft of a handle, wherein the receptable includes means for transferring torsional force exerted from the shaft to the body, to thereby cause the body to rotate as the shaft rotates. The spherical curler in accordance with this aspect of the present invention is useful for attachment to a shaft of a hairbrush, or to an automated hair winding device. According to a second aspect of the present invention, a hairstyling device is provided which includes a curler having a substantially spherical body. The curler further includes a conformal layer of material covering at least a portion of an outer surface of the body, wherein the layer of material includes a plurality of minute hook-shaped gripping elements for gripping the locks of hair of the user. Additionally, the body and layer of material each includes a plurality of apertures for allowing air to flow into and out from an interior cavity of the curler. A third aspect of the present invention is directed to a method for styling hair using a curler having a substantially spherical body and a plurality of minute hook-shaped gripping elements on an outer surface of the body. The method comprises the steps of applying the curler to a portion of the hair in a manner to engage the gripping elements with the hair portion; rotating the curler about a first axis in a manner to wind at least a first portion of the hair portion about the curler; and rotating the curler about a second axis in a manner to wind at least a second portion of the hair portion about the curler. Thus, while a lock of hair is being wound around the spherical curler, the axis of rotation of the curler may be changed during the winding or rolling process, before all of the hair is completely wound around the curler, to thereby allow for individualized hairstyling techniques for each curler. Such a hairstyling technique is not achievable using conventional cylindrical curlers since the cylindrical curler only allows for a single axis of rotation while winding hair around the curler. A fourth aspect of the present invention is directed to a method for styling hair using the spherical curler of the present invention in a manner to achieve results similar to that of a perm rod. The method includes the steps of winding a first portion of hair around a spherical curler; applying a perm solution to the wound portion of hair; removing the perm solution from the hair portion after an amount of time has elapsed sufficient to allow the solution to set the hair portion; and unwinding said hair portion from said curler after the perm solution has been removed. Using this method, the hair of a user can be permed with the shape of the curls retaining a helical shape having a continuum of differing diameters. Additional objects, features and advantages of the various aspects of the present invention will become apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiment, which description should be taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.",
    "full_text": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n     This invention relates generally to personal grooming devices, and more particularly to devices useful for hairstyling and for curling locks of hair. \n     Many persons with straight hair wish to temporarily alter their hairstyle through techniques such as curling, blowdrying, ironing, and/or perming. It has been customary in grooming hair to roll a tress or a plurality of strands of hair on a cylindrical curler and to apply a moistening agent to the hair. The hair is left in its rolled state until it has dried and set. After the hair has set, the cylindrical curlers are removed and the hair retains a curl or wave imparted by the cylindrical curler. \n     However, the curl imparted by a typical cylindrical curler is limited to the constraints of a constant diameter roller. The resultant lock of hair which has been curled using this technique forms a helical shape having a relatively constant diameter. Small diameter cylindrical rollers produce small he...",

    "abstract": "The within invention relates to a pneumatic compressed air engine for toy vehicles, the engine including a selectably inflatable air canister and an intake manifold having an engine air inlet in fluid communication with said air canister, the inlet including means for providing compressed air to said canister through the manifold. The pneumatic engine also includes a cylinder housing which is defined by distal and proximal regions thereof, an inlet in fluid communication with said engine air inlet and, at said proximal region, a plurality of air exhaust apertures. The engine further includes a one-way check valve including a proximal element, reciprocally situated at least partially within said engine air inlet, of the cylinder housing, the check valve residing in a normally closed position relative to the inlet. The engine further includes a piston slidably mounted along a longitudinal axis of said cylinder housing in a fluid-tight relationship to internal circumferential region walls of the distal region of the cylindrical housing. The piston includes an axial member projecting distally toward said cylinder housing inlet and proportioned in diameter for insertion thereunto. Said piston exhibits a substantially concave proximal surface. The pneumatic engine also includes a piston spring mounted about said axial member of said piston and having a length greater than said axial member. Thereby, at a distal end thereof, said piston spring exhibits a length sufficient to effect selectable contact with the proximal element of said check valve during intervals of high pressure between said piston and said distal cylinder housing. The engine also includes a connecting rod having a distal end proportioned for complemental non-rigid mechanical interface with said proximal surface of the piston. An eccentric is rotationally mounted to an engine power delivery shaft, said eccentric rotatably secured to a proximal end of said connecting rod, in which rotation of said eccentric by said rod transmits angular momentum to said system power shaft. Resultingly, reciprocation of said connecting rod by the eccentric will increase pressure between a distal side of said piston and enclosed internal portions of said distal cylinder housing, compressing said piston spring against said proximal element of said check valve. Thereby, potential energy is imparted to both said spring and the compressed air within said cylinder. As such, at a maximum of distal reciprocation, said proximal element of said check valve will urge open relative to said inlet of said of said cylinder housing, thereby effecting a brief high pressure input of compressed air from said canister, through said intake manifold into said distal region of the cylindrical housing. Said high pressure air input will thereby initiate an expansion of said piston spring and movement of the piston toward said proximal region of said cylinder housing, this causing reiterative cycles of reciprocation of said piston, connecting rod, cam and engine power shaft. The piston is returned to its zero or distal-most position b angular inertia from the cam and power shaft. It is an object of the present invention to provide an improved compressed air expansion engine having particular use as a power source for toy vehicles. It is another object to provide an inflatable pneumatic engine for toy vehicles having improved performance characteristics of stability, power, and flight duration over compressed air engines heretofore known in the art. It is a further object to provide a pneumatic engine of the above type that can be manufactured through the use of lightweight non-molded plastic components. It is a yet further object of the invention to provide a compressed air engine of the above type which can be economically manufactured and which is far more durable than such systems heretofore known in the art. The above and yet other objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from the hereinafter set forth Brief Description of the Drawings and Detailed Description of the Invention.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to a radially-expansible annular stent comprising a plurality of stenting turns around a lumen centered on a longitudinal axis, with adjacent turns being joined by connector struts, the stent annulus having a wall thickness that is related to the material of which it is formed. In the field of radially expansible annular stents that are called upon, in use, to resist a radially inwardly directed force from surrounding bodily tissue, in order to maintain a bodily lumen patent, there is a contradictory design requirement. On the one hand, the stent must be strong enough to keep the lumen patent. On the other hand, the stent prosthesis must be flexible enough to accommodate movement of surrounding bodily tissue. There are two archetypal stent forms. One of them has a stack of closed loop stenting rings, the length direction of the stent being along the length of the longitudinal axis of the annulus of the stent. The other archetype is the helical stent, in which the pattern of struts in the stent matrix performs a spiral path around the longitudinal axis, to create an annulus from one end of the stent to the other. Typically, each of the stenting loops is composed of closed periphery repeating unit cells. See EP-A-481365,  FIG. 2 . Typically, there are connector struts present, periodically through the annular matrix, to set the longitudinal spacing between adjacent stenting loops. See WO94/17754. Such a stent is typically made from a seamless straight tubular workpiece so that its disposition, at rest, and relaxed, is that of a tubular cylindrical annulus. Typically, after implantation in the body, it is called upon to conform to an arcuate configuration of the bodily lumen in which it is placed. Such a change of shape necessitates the occurrence of strain within the matrix. That strain might not be homogeneously distributed throughout the matrix. Important for flexibility of the stent, after placement in the body, is a capacity for tolerating enough strain to give the stent, as such, enough flexibility to move with the body. Another aspect of flexibility that is desirable when placing a stent is “radial conformability” by which is meant the ease with which succeeding turns of the stent can take or, after placement in tissue, different diameters clearly, when the struts connecting adjacent stenting rings have enhanced flexibility, an increase of radial conformability is in prospect. Closed periphery unit cells of the stenting matrix are inherently rather well-adapted to provide the required resistance to the radially inwardly pressing force of the bodily tissue. In consequence, it is desirable for any connectors of unit cells, within the matrix, to deliver at least a substantial portion of the strain needed to allow the stent matrix to move with the body. Such flexibility in the connector links is not detrimental to the capability of the stenting loops to push the bodily tissue radially outwardly. For this reason, current stent designs often exhibit unit cells with simple straight strut peripheral portions, connected by connector struts that are not short and straight but long and thin. They are often meandering or arcuate or serpentine. There is discussed below, with reference to  FIG. 1 , showing an exemplary stent having connector struts of the serpentine kind. This extra length provides the connectors with increased capacity to absorb strain and deliver flexibility to the stent, as such. However, building a stent annulus with convoluted or serpentine connectors adds to the complexity of manufacture and might not assist in meeting other government regulatory or quality control requirements. It is an object of the present invention to ameliorate these difficulties. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION According to the present invention, a stent as identified above is improved by arranging that, for the connector struts, the thickness of the struts is smaller than the ambient wall thickness of the stent. Typically, stents are made from a seamless tubular workpiece of constant wall thickness. The description which follows will provide at least one way to produce a stent in accordance with the present invention from a seamless tubular workpiece of constant wall thickness. Nickel-titanium shape memory alloy is a popular material from which to build self-expanding transluminally delivered bodily prostheses such as stents. Typically, they are made from the tubular workpiece by computer controlled laser cutting of slits in the workpiece, thereby to produce a matrix of struts. An attractive way to build stents in accordance with the present invention is by use of this laser cutting technique, known per se. The conventional laser cutting process for making stents is with a laser beam arranged on a line that extends through the longitudinal axis of the stent annulus. However, the state of the art does include proposals, not only from the present applicant in WO 03/075797, WO 2006/010636 and WO 2006/010638 but also from others, such as Langhans et al in US 2006/0064153, to orient the laser beam on a line that does not pass through the longitudinal axis of the annulus. It is this step which is relied upon, in the presently preferred embodiment and best mode known to the inventor, as described in detail below. The concept can be conveniently designated “off-axis cutting”. As will be seen below, an attractive feature of using off-axis laser cutting of the connectors is that one can provide the connectors with a transverse cross-section that is in some way asymmetric in comparison with a “conventional” on-axis laser-cut strut. Thus, the connectors in accordance with the present invention may have a transverse cross-section that includes a luminal apex at the intersection of two straight lines, that apex being the closest approach of the connector to the longitudinal axis. It can also create a connector having a transverse cross-section that includes an abluminal apex at the intersection of two straight lines, the apex being the point on the connector furthest away from the longitudinal axis. Such cross-sections through the connector can reveal a lack of mirror symmetry about a plane that includes the length direction of the connector and the longitudinal axis of the stent annulus. In other words, we can have a connector in which the transverse cross-section reveals a luminal apex and an abluminal apex, and the line passing through both of these apices does not also pass through the longitudinal axis of the annulus of the stent. As will be seen below, an attractive feature of the present invention is that it enables the creation of stent matrices that combine good radial force against bodily tissue with good flexibility both in the radially expanded and in the radially compressed dispositions in a design in which the connectors are simple, short, substantially straight struts. The stiffness of a strut of a stent matrix is proportional to the strut width but, in relation to the strut thickness, it goes up with the cube of the thickness. A small reduction of strut thickness can therefore yield large gains in flexibility. This property is utilised in the present invention by providing connector struts with a smaller radial wall thickness than that of the stent annulus. For a better understanding of the present invention and to show more clearly how the same may be carried into effect, reference will now be made, by way of example, to the accompanying drawings. These are incorporated herein and constitute part of this specification. They illustrate presently preferred embodiments of the invention and, together with the general description above, and the detailed description below, serve to explain the features of the invention.",

    "abstract": "The anatomical meniscal-bearing knee implant of the present invention has one or more compliant prosthetic menisci that are attached to the joint capsule and meniscal horns in a similar fashion to the way a natural meniscus is attached to a natural knee. Like a natural meniscus, the meniscal implant will be able to pivot and glide on the prosthetic tibial plateau. Arthrokinematic constraint will come from the meniscal implant&#39;s attachments, which will gently guide movements, providing a highly mobile but stable joint. Also through its attachments, the Anatomical Meniscal-Bearing Knee will provide proprioceptive input, giving the central nervous system feedback for refined motor control. Like a natural knee with intact menisci, the outer border of the menisci implants will be mechanically linked to the tibial plateau via the coronary ligament, such as for example by the implant being attached such as by its being sutured directly to the joint capsule/coronary ligament or indirectly by attaching it to the remaining meniscal rim which is in turn attached to the coronary ligament. Tendon slips from the quadriceps, attached to both medial and lateral meniscus, will pull the meniscal replacements forward during active extension and likewise, the semimembranosus (medial meniscus) and/or popliteus tendons (lateral meniscus) will pull the meniscal replacements posteriorly during active flexion. The proposed anatomical meniscal-bearing arthroplasty has one or multiple prosthetic menisci that are attached to either the diarthrodial joint capsule and/or the remnant of the natural menisci. The knee will be used to describe the preferred embodiment of this concept. However, the proposed meniscal bearing can be used to repair cartilage in other body joints. The prosthetic is preferably implanted in the knee via a minimally invasive procedure, leaving the quadriceps muscle group intact. A small arthrotomy will be performed, allowing the access to the knee joint. Then the central portion of the meniscus will be resected, leaving the horns, a peripheral meniscal rim, and the coronary ligament intact. One or more well-defined cavities will then be formed in the articular surfaces of the tibia and/or femur. One or more resurfacing implants would then either be press-fit, cemented or sutured into the prepared pocket. The meniscal prosthetic is then sewed into the meniscal rim. The non-meniscal articular resurfacing portion of the implants which contact the meniscus consists of cobalt chrome alloys, stainless steel, ceramics, polyethylene, and/or polyurethane and will closely approximate the normal articular geometry. The bulk of the meniscal prosthetic implant will preferably consist of a compliant polyvinyl alcohol polymer and/or polyurethane. A meshed fabric may be molded into the peripheral rim of the prosthetic body, allowing biological glues and/or sutures to connect the implant to the surrounding soft tissue. If the entire original meniscus needs to be removed, a flexible tube can be placed in the space bordered by the tibial plateau, coronary ligament, and anatomical meniscus in order to measure the natural soft tissue laxity. Different diameters of tubing represent different amounts of laxity/mobility in the natural meniscus/coronary ligament construct. This tubing can then be reused as a spacer to balance the soft tissue connections, simulating the restraint of the natural meniscus. One preferred material for the meniscal implant is polyurethane. Polyurethane can be made flexible so it can conform to the femoral and tibial components, thus giving the knee a large contact area throughout the entire range of motion. Likewise, a polyvinyl alcohol polymer which imbibes aqueous fluids can be used. Like cartilage, it imbibes aqueous fluids and generates a fluid-film-bearing surface. The shape of the meniscal implants will closely conform to the tibial plateaus and femoral condyles, generating large areas of contact. They can either be congruent or, to distribute stresses more evenly they can be slightly incongruent as described by Goodfellow et al., The Design of Synovial Joints, Scientific Foundations of Orthopaedics and Traumatology, pp. 78–88. The meniscal portions of the implant will be flexible so they can conform to the tibial and femoral bearing surfaces throughout the entire range of motion. The anatomical meniscal-bearing concept could also be used in a unicondylar knee replacement. Because the meniscal portion of the implant is able to spin and glide on the tibial plateau, and because the meniscal replacement is flexible, the implant will be less sensitive to malalignement. With existing unicondylar knee replacements if the implant is malaligned the entire joint will likely experience abnormal stresses. Another possible use for this implant would be in the meniscal replacement surgery. The meniscal portion of the implant can be used by itself, being sewed to the joint capsule and meniscal horns of the knee. Also, variation in the meniscal implant can be made for replacement of menisci from other joints, i.e., sternoclavicular, temperomandibular, and zygapophyseal. The invention also relates to a surgical procedure which is minimally invasive when compared to standard techniques currently used for resurfacing the knee joint or other body joints. In this method, the incision length is limited between 2 and 2½ times the patellar width. During forming the incision, the surgeon should avoid turning the patella (everting) over from its natural position. Steps should also be taken to leave the quadriceps muscle in its natural position by making sure it is not severed or twisted. Attachments to the peripheral tibial plateau, horns and surrounding ligaments and musculature is maintained through the meniscal rim. For example, the anterior cruciate ligament, if attached to the meniscal rim, should be maintained. Likewise, the transverse ligament should be left attached to the meniscal horns. The inner portion of the meniscus is then removed. Preferably, the incision/resection is made within or at the border of the zone of the meniscus known as the red or vascularized region. Tibial sizing guides are used to measure the size of the meniscal resection (length of resection arc and thickness at the red-zone border). If femoral resurfacing is needed, the femoral resection may be done using a femoral alignment guide which has a rod extending externally of the incision, which rod points to the femoral head. The rod indicates implant flexion and implant rotation within the frontal plane. Once properly aligned, a femoral sizing template is used to measure and guide a posterior femoral cut. Obviously, there will be several different size templates corresponding to the several femoral implant sizes. The template may include a saw blade slot for preparing the posterior surface of the femur. A tibial-sizing tray is utilized to prepare the tibial bone cuts within the inner portion of the meniscus. Preferably, the meniscus will be removed in an oval or “D”-shape with the oval aligned with the two anatomic meniscal horns. Obviously, again, there are various size templates corresponding to different size tibias. Once aligned, the tray template is pinned in position and a burr or end mill is used to mill a pocket into the tibial plateau. A second template or deeper layer of the first template-shaped like an “I” beam (if a second template is used, it is placed over the pins after the initial template is removed) and a deeper recess is formed within the initial recess or cavity. In other words, the “I”-shaped pocket is deeper than the original “D”-shaped or oval pocket to accommodate an “I”-shaped keel on the implant. Preferably as the “D”-shaped pockets grow in size, the “I”-shaped keel receiving recess also increases, however, it may remain the same size if desired. The “D”-shaped pocket formed should encompass the entire tibial plateau within the rim with the “I”-shaped recess in the center. On the femoral side, a femoral burr template is pinned in position and a recess of general uniform depth is formed, as by milling with a burr, along the condyle of the distal femur. A femoral implant, preferably made of a cobalt chrome alloy such as Vitallium® alloy or a ceramic material is implanted in the recess formed on the femoral condyle. Preferably, this implant has a thickness corresponding to the depth of the recess formed so that the outer surface of the implant is located at the correct anatomical position. A tibial resurfacing implant is provided and has a “D”-shaped corresponding the various size templates provided. For each implant profile, several implant thicknesses are provided. The thickness is chosen such that the implant will be aligned in the varus/valgus direction. Once the implant thickness is determined, the actual implant will either be press fit or cemented into place. The tibial plateau implant has a contact surface preferably made of polyethylene and will have a porous titanium surface against the bone. The bone contacting porous surface attached to the polyethylene preferably is made of titanium or cobalt chrome or any other biocompatible porous material. Alternatively, the tibial implant can be made of polyurethane, cobalt chrome, ceramics, or a polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel. Alternatively, the implant may be in the shape of a circular disc with a periphery located immediately inside the remaining rim of the tibia. Once the tibial plateau is resurfaced, a meniscal implant is attached to the remaining meniscal rim such by suturing. A sizing template is used to determine the required implant size in all three anatomical planes. The meniscus, which is attached to the remaining rim of the tibial plateau is preferably made of a polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel or a polyurethane but can be made of any biocompatible soft, compliant material that is able to withstand the functional loading and tribiological conditions. The implant is sutured into the remaining meniscal rim. The sutures can be made part of the implant such as by molding. See, for example, the implant of Kenny U.S. Pat. No. 4,344,193. The sutures may be made integral with a mesh that is also molded into the implant. The mesh can abut the meniscal rim and allow for the potential of soft tissue ingrowth. Bioactive factors such as tissue cultures, resorbables, bone morphogenic proteins can be added to the mesh to encourage the tissue ingrowth. See Stone U.S. Pat. No. 5,007,934.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to a method of transferring objects with compressed gas, and more particularly to a method of transferring various kinds of objects highly effectively, to many places, including distant places, extending over a wide area. The method employs compressed gas as a transferring medium to repeatedly and continuously transfer the various objects. When the specific gravity of such compressed gas is equal to that of air or the like, problems associated with gravity can be ignored within 1,000 m above the ground, and the air pressure is a wave motion traveling at the velocity of 340 m per second. Accordingly, such natural conditions can be utilized to actively transfer objects. Conventionally, pumps have been used to transfer liquid objects by means of pressure, but their applicability is rather limited to each specific purpose. That is, such pumps are expensive and can effect transfer of only a short distance. Particularly in the case of liquids which contain highly viscous or solid substances, the mechanical durability of a pump is decreased because the structure of the pump allows viscous or solid substances to enter its mechanism, which leads to frequent repairs and replacements of components caused by breakdown and wear. Also, many different pumps are inevitably required for different specific purposes. Thus, pumps are not necessarily sufficient to transfer objects by pressure to specific higher places or distant places. Furthermore, the active power (energy) used for transferring objects cannot be retained as energy. As soon as the transfer is completed, the energy is dispersed. In order to continue further transfer, it is necessary to supply new active power (energy). Naturally, as far as pumps are applied in transferring objects by pressure using present pump mechanisms, the active power cannot be retained for further repeated and continuous use. In addition, there has not yet been provided a complete freeze-prevention measure to prevent pumps and pipes from freezing in winter, due to the excessive costs involved. In view of these circumstances, the inventor has provided a method of transferring objects, including an Atmospheric Pressure Operation, a Natural Pressure Operation, an Added Pressure Operation, an Alternate Added Pressure Operation, and a Continuous Added Pressure Operation, as disclosed in the International Publication No. WO 90/03322. An Atmospheric Pressure Operation is a method wherein the air in the atmosphere is compressed to provide active power for use in a transfer operation. For example, a first pressure tank with a capacity of 1 m 3  is placed on the ground and filled with water. An empty tank with the capacity of 1 m 3  is placed at a level of 100 m above the first tank and is connected to the first tank with a pipe. When a compressor compresses air from the atmosphere and delivers the compressed air continuously at an atm. gauge pressure (pressure) somewhat higher than 10 atm., the water in the first tank gradually flows into the second tank. As a result, the first tank is filled with 1 m 3  of compressed air with the pressure somewhat higher than 10 atm., and the second tank is filled with 1 m 3  of water. By electronically sensing when this step is completed, the valve at the bottom of the first tank is closed, so that the compressed air can be fully retained without dispersion. Namely, in the Atmospheric Pressure Operation, water is pushed up, using air as a medium of transfer, to the level of 100 m above the first tank, and then the active power used to transfer the water is retained as a replacement for the water (or other objects) in the first tank, i.e., the place where the objects have been transferred from. A Natural Pressure Operation is defined as an operation where the compressed air, retained in a pressure tank as active power (energy), is utilized by merely opening and closing the valves of the pressure tank, without consuming any other energy such as power required to actuate general machines. For example, when the 1 m 3  of compressed air, which has a pressure of a little higher than 10 atm. and is retained in the first tank in accordance with the Atmospheric Pressure Operation, is sent to the second tank filled with 1 m 3  of water 100 m above the ground, the total volume of 1 m 3  of water in the second tank is pushed up to a third tank 45 m above, in accordance with the Natural Pressure Operation. In this case, the first tank and the second tank each possess compressed air at 4.5 atm. gauge pressure retained after the first transfer process. The total volume of 2 m 3  of compressed air at 4.5 atm. gauge pressure is pushed up in accordance with the Natural Pressure Operation to the third tank, and 1 m 3  of water in the third tank is pushed up to a fourth tank with a capacity of 1 m 3  26.6 m above. Thus, if the above method using the tank capacity of 1 m 3  is used in successive Natural Pressure Operations, the total transfer height that this operation can achieve is 122.19 m. When precisely calculated using integral calculus, 1 m 3  of water can be pushed up to the height of 164 m in accordance with the Natural Pressure Operation. Namely, it is proven that the active power of the compressed air required for transferring 1 m 3  of water to the height of 100 m in the Atmospheric Pressure Operation is equal to that which can push the water up to the height of 164 m. An Added Pressure Operation is a method wherein compressed air is taken and compressed by a compressor for use in a transfer operation. An operation in which compressed air, retained as an energy source after the Atmospheric Pressure Operation, is taken and compressed by a compressor, and an operation which utilizes compressed air retained in a receiver tank, can both be called an Added Pressure Operation. For example, under the condition that 1 m 3  of water in the first tank on the ground is pushed up to the second tank 100 m above the ground in accordance with Atmospheric Pressure Operation, the compressed air having an atm. gauge pressure of a little higher than 10 atm. retained in the first tank is taken and compressed to be pushed up to a third tank set 100 m above the second tank by a compressor. At the stage that the water in the second tank is almost sent up to the third tank with exception of a little water remaining inside the second tank, the pressure of the first tank drops to zero atm. gauge pressure, i.e. to the level of the atmosphere. Theoretically, it is possible that the air in the first tank is taken and pushed up into the second tank by further actuating a compressor until the inside of the tank becomes a vacuum. By doing so, all of the remaining water in the second tank is pushed up into the third tank. But the efficiency is badly decreased when a compressor is used to generate negative pressure. Instead, therefore, by electronically sensing the instant the pressure inside the first tank drops to an arm. gauge pressure of zero, or to the level of the atmosphere, the little water remaining in the second tank is pushed up to the third tank in an Atmospheric Pressure Operation. Namely, in this case, both an Added Pressure Operation and an Atmospheric Pressure Operation are used. As this alternative, by electronically sensing the instant the pressure of the first tank drops to the level of the atmosphere, the valve at the bottom of the first tank is opened. Through said valve, supplemental water flows into the first tank, whereby preparing supplemental water while conducting the Atmospheric Pressure Operation is possible. Needless to say, only the Added Pressure Operation enables the transfer of water utilizing the compressed air retained in a receiver tank. Alternate Added Pressure Operation is a method wherein an object is transferred to a next step tank continuously in Added Pressure Operation by alternate replacement of compressed air and an object in between a plurality of tanks. For example, two tanks are set in parallel. The first tank is filled with compressed air and the second tank having the same capacity as the first tank is filled with water. First, the compressed air in the first tank is acted against the water in the second tank by a compressor. Then the water in the second tank is sent to a next step. When the transfer is completed, the first tank is filled with water. Next, the compressed air retained in the second tank is acted against the water in the first tank. Thus, by alternately transferring the objects in the first tank and the second tank in Added Pressure Operation, a continuous transfer into a next stage can be made. In this case, also, by utilizing the compressed air prepared in a receiver tank, the whole process of transfer can be conducted in Added Pressure Operation. Continuous Added Pressure Operation is available for further stages, provided a plurality of tanks are set in parallel at each stage so as to be conducted in Alternate Added Pressure Operation. In methods of transferring objects with compressed gas, Added Pressure Operation, and practical types thereof, such as Alternate Added Pressure Operation and Continuous Added Pressure Operation, are superior in that the energy used for the transfer action can be retained and used for further transfer repeatedly and continuously, as compared to mechanical transferring methods such as witch pumps. However, when transferring the entire amount of the object, after completion of Added Pressure Operation, it is required thereafter to apply Atmospheric Pressure Operation, or to let the remaining object flow in under a little negative pressure, or to conduct Added Pressure Operation utilizing the compressed air retained in a receiver tank prior to the operation. If none of these methods is adopted, then it is required that air is taken by a compressor until the inside of a tank becomes from zero to vacuum. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a transfer method comprising two cycle systems of a perfect closed type in which compressed air as an active power source is entrapped. One cycle for an Alternate Added Pressure Operation conducts continuous transfer while the other cycle supplements the liquid transfer material. Further, as for adding liquid, the present invention provides a continuous addition method wherein material is taken continuously from outside into the closed cycle utilizing the pressure difference of the compressed air as a medium of transfer so as to provide a more highly effective continuous transfer method. To accomplish the above objects, two cycle systems of a closed type, comprising compression devices and a plurality of pressure tanks, are set up in accordance with the present invention. In one cycle system, material is transferred continuously to a transfer destination by replacement of material with compressed air, while the other cycle system draws up more material, continuously utilizing the pressure differences, and continuously supplying the drawn material into the former cycle system. Moreover, in order to recycle compressed air sent to a transfer destination together with the material back to the origin of the transfer, with the aim of utilizing the air as an active power source continuously and repeatedly, the following method is adopted. Namely, there is provided a transfer method wherein the liquid material and the compressed air are fed alternately by a compression device and transferred continuously to a pressure tank set at a transfer destination. The material is discharged to the outside from the bottom of the pressure tank, and the compressed air is drawn up from the top of the tank and returned to the origin of transfer. Thereafter, the compressed air is replaced with liquid alternately for further transfer. Also, in order to further transfer the transferred material to higher places or to more distant places, the following method is adopted. Namely, there is provided a method wherein a first tank containing a gas at atmospheric pressure receives transferred material by utilizing a pressure difference, and a second tank reserves the material pushed from the first tank by drawing up the gas in the first tank with a compression device, and a third tank is filled with compressed gas which is to be pushed into the second tank by a compression device. Thus, in this method, the atmospheric air is replaced with the object, the object is replaced with compressed air, and the compressed air is replaced with atmospheric air. By such continuous cyclic replacement, the transferred material is further transferred to another place. By adopting the above respective methods, the method of transferring material with compressed gas becomes more practical and the material can be transferred continuously and more effectively. The material is also supplemented continuously, so that the effectiveness of the continuous method of transferring material increases.",

    "abstract": "There has also been a long-felt need in the dental profession for a cushion material to fit between dental appliances and irritated gums. Such a material, which promotes heating and is readily applicable by the wearer of the appliance, would be especially useful. There has also been a long-felt need in the dental profession for a more practical wound dressing which can be used in the mouth. Normal gauze and cloth bandages are not comfortably useful in a dental subject&#39;s mouth for long periods of time. Normal dental peridontal pressure packs become hard when wet so that they only protect the wound and do not apply a uniform pressure. Foam dressings, such as Dow Corning&#39;s SILASTIC® Foam Dressing, are known for use in open, granulating wounds. However, the system of components used to generate this foam dressing has a viscosity which, when first mixed, is not sufficiently high to be normally desirable in a respiratory pathway and the resulting foam composition is not sufficiently resistant to compression to meet the needs of dentistry described above. This prior art foam dressing also has the disadvantage of an unpleasant taste. Such prior art foams are described in greater detail in British Pat. Nos. 798,669 and 867,619. It is known from British Pat. No. 841,825 to use a non-foaming silicone room temperature vulcanizing composition for making dental impressions. It is known from U.S. Pat. No. 3,399,457 to use a rigid foam to form a permanently deformable bite block. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is, therefore, an object of this invention to obtain separation of the gingival border from the adjacent tooth. It is a further object of this invention to obtain improved cleaning of tooth surfaces. It is also an object of this invention to place a cushion between a dental appliance and the gum against which it is worn. It is still another object of this invention to place a foam dressing in open wounds in the mouth. It is also an object of this invention to place an improved pressure pack on dental wounds. It is another object of this invention to present a foam composition for dental use having a desirable resistance to compression after foaming and a paste-like consistency before foaming. It is also an object of this invention to overcome the disadvantages of the prior art. These and other objects are accomplished by a biocompatible elastomeric foam composition which is useful in dentistry. The foam is developed from a paste-like system of components such that after a volume expansion of at least about 150%, a uniformly fine-grained foam material is obtained. The foam composition has a resistance to compression such that a force of at least about 50 g. per square cm. applied against one side results in a 10% deflection of the material. In a preferred embodiment, such a force of about 80 g. per square cm. results in a 10% deflection. The paste-like consistency of the system of components and the resistance to compression of the resulting foam composition give this new composition surprising and unexpected utility in dentistry over known materials, making new methods of treatment possible. This new foam composition may be used in a process for temporarily separating the gingiva from the adjacent tooth in the mouth of a dental patient. The process includes the steps of placing the components of the system at the margin between the gingiva and the tooth, placing a carrier over the components to contain the foam as it is developed by the components, maintaining the developed foam in pressure contact with the margin for a period of time, and removing the foam from contact with the margin. Subsequent treatment of the tooth may be accomplished after the foam is removed such as gingival curettage or the taking of a dental impression. When the foam composition is formed in contact with a tooth surface, it may be used in another aspect of the present invention to clean the tooth surface by causing relative motion between the tooth surface and the foam. Such relative motion may be accomplished by a chewing or swallowing motion made by the dental patient. In yet another aspect of the present invention the components of the foam are placed on the surface of a dental appliance which is normally in contact with a dental patient&#39;s gums and the appliance is placed against the gum while the foam is developed from the system of components. In still another aspect of the present invention the components of system are placed in a wound in the mouth of a dental patient and the foam is allowed to develop in the wound.

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a puncture resistant material for use in a garment where the garment is intended to offer a significant level of protection against puncture from alien objects. Materials offering varying degrees of such protection for different applications are known, for example those used in items such as bullet resistant vests, surgical and garden gloves etc. The principal requirement of such materials is that they safely perform the function for which they are intended, i.e. that they afford at least the required degree of protection. With garden gloves for example, the gloves are intended to offer the wearer sufficient protection against injury from for example thorns. With a bullet resistant vest, clearly the vest must be able to prevent penetration from bullets. In all cases, the item should ideally not detrimentally affect the activities of the wearer and be as comfortable as possible to wear. Thus for garden gloves, as well as providing protection to the wearer, the gloves should be sufficiently flexible and offer adequate sensitivity so as not to inhibit the gardening activities of the wearer. The flexibility and sensitivity of a garment will depend on the characteristics and dimensions of the material from which it is made. Generally speaking a thicker material will offer less flexibility and sensitivity than a thinner material. In certain applications there is therefore often a compromise between protection and flexibility/sensitivity with regard to the material thickness. For example for surgical gloves the requirements of flexibility and sensitiveness are paramount, bearing in mind the delicate operations a surgeon has to perform. Ideally therefore the material should be as thin as possible. In this connection most surgical gloves currently in use are made from latex, an elastic material which can be made sufficiently thin so as to offer the required degree of flexibility and sensitivity for delicate operative techniques. The choice of latex for surgeon&#39;s gloves has in the past arisen predominantly out of the flexibility and sensitivity necessities and has in a protection point of view been in the patient&#39;s rather than the surgeon&#39;s interests, i.e. for the purpose of maintaining as sterile conditions as possible for the patient so as to minimise the risks of infection. However the use of surgical gloves is now also becoming vital in the role of providing protection for the surgeon against accidental self inflicted injuries that regularly occur by way of so-called `needle stick` accidents. Such accidents occur for example when a surgeon inadvertently stabs himself or herself with a needle or scalpel blade that is being used. Protection in the form of gloves is thus utilised by surgeons and other health workers to reduce the risk of infection to themselves in such circumstances. The puncture resistance of latex gloves is however minimal such that with current concerns in relation to accidental infection of diseases such as HIV (human immunodefeciency virus) and Hepatitis A,B,C,D and E and in the absence of any better alternative, surgeons are often `double gloving`, namely wearing two latex gloves on each hand, one on top of another, to reduce the risks of glove puncture and thus infection. Clearly the use of two gloves in this way can only detrimentally lessen the flexibility and touch sensitivity of the glove to the wearer. There are known materials in the field of armoured clothing, for example as disclosed in co-pending application No. WO 93/21492, which are puncture resistant and are directed to affording protection from projectiles, e.g. bullets. However such materials are generally heavy duty and cannot by virtue of their interlocking construction provide the degree of flexibility required for delicate applications. There are also materials available which are primarily cut or slash resistant in that they offer the wearer of a garment made from such a material increased protection against cuts and slashes made across the material. This is useful for providing protection against, say scalpel wounds. Such materials are however not notably puncture resistant. US-A-5200263 and US-A-5138719 both disclose puncture resistant materials which comprise a plurality of flat platelets formed either of metal discs or carbon fibres which are disposed within the material. Such materials are made by dipping a former into a polymeric material, for example, a latex usually used for glove formation into which has been disposed a plurality of platelets. By virtue of the dipping procedure the platelets to a certain extent orientate in the latex material, but always at the junction of overlaying layers of latex. Materials such as those disclosed in these citations do in fact increase penetration resistance to needle stick but not to the necessary degree, due possibly to a failure of the dipping process to reliably align the platelets, particularly when these are of small size, parallel to the plane of the material. Latex gloves such as those commonly used by surgeons have relatively low puncture resistance. As shown in FIG. 5 which follows, for example, single glove thicknesses have a penetration resistance of about 20 grams and double gloves tend to have a penetration resistance of 40 grams. By way of comparison, leather with an equivalent thickness will have a static load resistance of a little over 200 grams while a Medak glove which is some six times thicker and hence is quite unsuited to surgical use other than for orthopaedic procedures will resist a little over 600 grams static load. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention seeks to provide in one aspect a puncture resistant sheet material able to reliably withstand 1000 grams static loading while still maintaining flexibility, sensitivity, and impermeability. The applicants have found that this may be achieved by using pressure-forming techniques since it is believed these act upon the platelets in an unformed polymer mix to orientate them more precisely parallel to the plane of the material in the overlapped condition. Accordingly therefore, the present invention provides a puncture resistant polymeric sheet material comprising a plurality of discrete platelets disposed substantially parallel to the plane of the sheet material in an overlapping orientation; characterised in that the orientation of the platelets in the sheet material has been effected by aligning platelets within the polymeric material by subjecting it to positive or negative pressure when plastic during the forming process. By this means, at least a majority of the platelets are aligned so as to be substantially parallel to the opposed surfaces of the sheet material and in an overlapped position such that the sheet material can reliably resist penetration. The puncture resistant polymeric sheet material is preferably formed into its final shape by stretch blow moulding and hence is particularly suited to the production of gloves, although other blow moulded items may similarly be formed. In a preferred form of the invention, the material has a thickness of more than 200 μm and can withstand a needle point loading above 500 grams.",

    "abstract": "Accordingly, the present invention is directed to further improvements in spinal fusion procedures. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, an apparatus for facilitating fusion of adjacent bony structures includes an implant body dimensioned for positioning between adjacent bone structures to maintain the bone structures in desired spaced relation during interbody fusion. The implant body has an outer wall and an external threaded configuration disposed on the outer wall. At least one concave surface at least partially extends along the implant body. The concave surface advantageously reduces the transverse cross-sectional dimension of the implant member thereby facilitating placement of the implant member in restricted intervertebral areas. In addition, the concave surface enables placement of a pair of implants in nested side-by-side relation. Preferably, the threaded configuration has portions removed along an arc section of the outer wall thereby defining a series of generally longitudinally aligned concave surfaces in individual turns thereof. A system and method for facilitating fusion of adjacent vertebrae is also disclosed.

    "abstract": "This application is a division, of application Ser. No. 06/143,644, filed Apr. 25, 1980, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,265,874. This invention pertains to a method for delivering a drug that needs assistance in its delivery from an osmotic device. More particularly, the invention relates to an improved method for delivering from an osmotic device a drug, which drug exhibits limited solubilities and precipitates in neutral and acid surroundings, to an exterior acid environment. The improved method comprises creating a basic condition in the device, raising the pH of the exterior environment in the vicinity of the passageway, and producing an effervescent suspension that transports the drug in finely dispersed form away from the device in the environment of use. The invention also concerns compositions comprising the drug and a compound containing a carbon dioxide generating moiety. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Osmotic systems manufactured in the form of osmotic devices for delivering a drug to an environment of use are known to the art in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,845,770 and 3,916,899, both issued to inventors Felix Theeuwes and Takeru Higuchi. A typical system, disclosed in these patents, comprises a semipermeable wall that surrounds a compartment containing a drug. The wall is permeable to an external fluid and substantially impermeable to the passage of drug. There is a passageway through the wall for deliverying drug from the system. The system releases drug by fluid being continuously imbibed through the wall into the compartment at a rate determined by the permeability of the wall and the osmotic pressure gradient across the wall to produce a solution containing soluble drug that is dispensed from the system over time. While the above system is an outstanding invention and represents a pioneer advancement in the delivery art, and while it is endowed with ideal delivery kinetics useful for delivering numerous beneficial drugs at controlled rates and continuously to the environment of use, there is an occasional instance where the delivery kinetics of the system can be unexpectedly improved leading to more desirable results. For example, many antiinflammatory drugs are practically insoluble in acid environments, such as in the gastric fluid of the stomach, and these drugs on their delivery from the system immediately precipitate on contact with the gastric fluid. This phenonemon occurs with precipitating drug accumulating at the exit of the passageway and on the exterior surface of the wall of the system. The precipitated drug impedes the flow of a saturated drug solution through the passageway, and the precipitated drug on the wall also impedes the imbibition of fluid into the system. These phenoneman seriously diminish the release of these drugs at meaningful and beneficial rates from the system. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,036,228, issued to Felix Theeuwes, and patentee discloses an osmotic system embodying a means for delivering drugs that are hard to deliver, particularly drugs that are practically insoluble in aqueous-type fluids. The means consists essentially in charging the system with an effervescent couple comprising an acidic component and a basic component. In operation when the system is in a fluid environment, the couple imbibes fluid into the system, thereby wetting the couple, causing it to react and produce in the system an effervescent solution. The effervescent solution creates a neutral condition in the system and it dispenses the drug from the system. The patent does not address itself to the delivery of drugs that exhibit limited solubilities in acidic environments, the use of only the basic components, and the production of effervescence in the environment of use. Thus, in the light of the above discussion, it will be readily appreciated by those versed in the subject art that a critical need exists for a means for delivering drugs that have limited solubilities in acidic environments, especially where the means overcomes the tribulations associated with the prior art. Likewise, it will be further appreciated by those skilled in the art, that if a novel and useful method is made available for delivering these drugs, such a method would have a positive value and also represent a substantial contribution to the art. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, in the light of the above presentation, it becomes an immediate object of the invention to provide a novel and useful method for delivering at meaningful rates from an osmotic system, drugs that are difficult to deliver. Another object of the invention is to provide a method for delivering drug from an osmotic system using a method that overcomes the difficulties associated with the prior art. Still another object of the invention is to provide a method for dispensing a drug from an osmotic device, which drug has a limited solubility in a fluid that enters the device, yet it is dispensed by the method from the device in a predetermined amount, at a controlled and continuous rate to an environment of use. Yet still another object of the invention is to provide a method for delivering a drug that is difficult to deliver from an osmotic device, which method comprises using a basic compound that generates carbon dioxide in an exterior acid environment for delivering the drug away from the osmotic delivery device. Still a further object of the invention is to provide a method for dispensing a drug from an osmotic device, which method can administer a complete pharmaceutical regimen to a human for a particular time period, the use of which requires intervention only for initiation and optional termination of the regimen. Yet still another object of the invention is to provide a method for delivering a drug that has limited solubility in an acid environment of use to the environment, which method consists essentially of delivering the drug in a finely dispersed form in an effervescent suspension to the environment over a prolonged period of time. Other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be more apparent to those skilled in the art form a reading of the detailed description of the specification, taken in conjunction with the claims. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention concerns a method for delivering a drug from an osmotic device. The method comprises housing in the compartment of the device a drug that is poorly soluble in aqueous and acid surroundings, and a basic compound having a carbon dioxide generating moiety. The method releases drug by fluid being imbibed into the compartment creating a solution containing drug and compound under hydrostatic pressure, which solution is dispensed through the passageway into an acidic fluid environment of use. In the environment, the compound in the solution on immediate contact with the acid in the environment reacts therewith and generates carbon dioxide gas. This physical activity, and the gas, dispense the drug in a finely dispersed fluffy form from the device, thereby delivering the drug to the environment of use.",

    "abstract": "Hepatitis A (infectious hepatitis) antigen is obtained from the stools of patients in the acute phase of hepatitis A disease. The stools are extracted in an aqueous medium and the extracts are centrifuged. Supernates having hepatitis A antigen titer of 1:4 or greater are usable as hepatitis A antigen in serological testing for hepatitis A antibody and for the preparation of a vaccine for hepatitis A disease. It has now been found that hepatitis A antigen usable in an immune adherence hemagglutination assay and for the preparation of hepatitis A vaccine is obtained from the stools of patients in the acute phase of hepatitis A disease. According to the present invention the stools are homogenized mechanically in an aqueous medium such as a physiological salt solution, e.g. saline or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The homogenate is centrifuged to separate solids and the supernate is assayed for hepatitis A content according to the method described in the copending patent application of William J. Miller and William J. McAleer filed Dec. 9, 1974 as Ser. No. 531,020. Extracts having antigen titers of 1:4 or greater are usable as hepatitis A antigen in the foregoing assay. The antigen extracts can be further purified by extraction with ether at lowered temperatures with recovery of the aqueous layer. The antigen can further be heated to reduce non-specific activity of the antigen preparation. Anitgen preparations obtained as described above, with or without ether and heat treatments, have been found to have hepatitis A antigen activity because they give positive immune adherence reactions with human sera known to contain hepatitis A antibody, and negative immune adherence reactions with human sera known to be devoid of hepatitis A antibody. The antigen extract can also be used in the preparation of immunizing antigen, i.e., vaccine. For this purpose the stools are extracted and centrifuged as described above and the extracts having immune adherence hepatitis A antigen titer of 1:4 or greater are treated with ultrasound. The sonicated extract is centrifuged. Sediment is recovered with the aid of ultra-sound and resuspended in PBS. The suspension is filtered and the filtrate applied to a cesium chloride gradient having a density range of from about 1.1 to about 1.4 grams/cm 3  and centrifuged. Fractions containing viral antigen (with densities in the region of from about 1.32 to about 1.36 g/cm 3 ) are collected and dialyzed against distilled water. The antigen preparation is then extracted with an equal volume of ethyl ether at about 4° C. for from about 10 to about 30 hours. The aqueous phase is recovered, acidified to a pH of from about 2 to about 4 and allowed to stand at ambient temperature for a period of from about 1 hour to about 5 hours. The pH is then re-adjusted to approximately 7.0. The resulting antigen is then heated to from about 50 to about 65° C. for from about 0.5 to about 2 hours. The antigen preparation is clarified by centrifugation at about 2500 rpm for about 15 minutes. The supernate is reacted with 1:4000 formalin at about 37° C for about 72 hours. The excess formaldehyde is neutralized with sodium bisulfite. The resulting preparation consists of the immunizing antigen (vaccine).

    "abstract": "The present invention provides a sink support shell apparatus and method of making a sink support shell. The sink support shell apparatus according to the present invention is a shell shaped to be compatible with the sink that is to be placed in the sink support shell (hereafter referred to as the “shell”). The sink support shell includes a rim for mounting the shell either above or below the countertop level. The sink sits in shell and is attached to the shell by a waterproof adhesive, such as silicon glue. The shell further includes an overflow/vent channel and stand-off in the base for attaching the shell to the necessary plumbing fixtures to allow for drainage of the water from the sink. The overflow/vent channel is formed in the material of the shell and allows water to flow down the channel to be drained by the attached plumbing fixtures. In addition, the overflow/vent channel provides an air channel that prevents pressure build up in the plumbing fixtures and suction noise during draining of the sink. The sink support shell is made of high-impact material, such as a metal or hard plastic material. In a preferred embodiment, the sink support shell is formed from a hard plastic material. The hard plastic sink support shell may be created using thermal formed plastic in which a heated sheet of plastic is placed over a mold of the sink and cooled such that the plastic sheet takes on the form of the sink. Thereafter, the rim, overflow/vent channel, stand-off and drainage hole maybe formed by tooling the cooled plastic shell. The high-impact material provides protection for the sink from impacts on the underside of the sink. In addition, the sink support shell provides a leak proof support in the event of cracks or breaks in the sink due to impacts on the upper surface of the sink. Moreover, the sink support shell provides a more aesthetically pleasing exterior for the underside of the sink. Most importantly, the sink support shell of the present invention provides a support that provides strength and protection to the sink and thereby allows the sink to be fashioned from less material than prior art sinks. That is, because the sink support shell of the present invention provides the protection and strength needed to mount the sink to the countertop, protect against impacts, and the like, the sink may be fabricated from a thinner material. As a result, the weight and cost of the sink is reduced making it more affordable to customers and less of a concern with regard to installation in locations where weight is an issue. These and other features and advantages of the present invention will be described in, or will become apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art in view of, the following detailed description of the preferred embodiments.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to the poultry industry, and more particularly to means and a method for improving the production of boilers; that is, edible poultry, preferably on a large scale. The term &#34;poultry&#34; as used herein, means and is intended to mean, domestic fowls which are propagated and fattened for the table and for their eggs, feathers, etc., such as chickens, turkeys, ducks, guinea fowls and geese. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART Conventionally, broiler poultry are grown or reared on the floors of insulated barns or the like, with a litter of straw, shavings, shells, or other discrete particles or frangible material. The dropping or manure from the birds are allowed to accumulate and to penetrate or permeate the previously disposed litter of straw, shells, shavings or other particle-like material. Periodically, this accumulation is cleaned out manually, washed out or otherwise disposed of and removed from the chicken house. Then a new or fresh batch of such litter is laid down on the clean floor. This method of raising poultry on an industrial scale has its disadvantages as, for example, by reason of the cost of buying, spreading and removing the litter with the accumulated droppings from the floor of the chicken house or barn. Alternatively, it has been proposed to raise poultry birds on wire screening, and to dispose of the manure droppings by moving conveyor belts that are positioned below the wire floors upon which the birds are placed during the growing period. It has also been proposed, as in U.S. Pat. No. 3,892,201, to house the birds in cage units which have solid floors; with a series of such solid floors being disposed in a vertically spaced relationship, with the poultry being raised on some or all of the floors. In this method, the droppings produced by the growing poultry are not periodically removed, but are permitted to pile up or build up on the floor surfaces of the bird cages. This forms a litter-free layer of manure upon which the poultry are supported during the growing period. Throughout that period the manure is dried out and maintained in a dry state by passing a current or flow of air over the floor surfaces and the layer of manure covering the floor and interposed between that floor and the poultry. To that end, air under pressure is expelled from an air chamber provided with vertically spaced and aligned outlets for each level or tier of tiered bird cages. Each of the air outlets is equipped with a deflector in order to spread the flow of air evenly over the floor surfaces, and to dry out the piled up manure covering the floor surfaces on each of the stacked floors or tiers. By such means, the moisture level of manure layer is maintained substantially below about 40% by weight of such manure. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present inventive improvements relate to a mobile fan used to cool and dry the poultry houses or the like. Such fan comprises a propeller driven by a gasoline fuel engine which may be mounted on a wooden base. The fan assembly may be covered by an encompassing cage and it may be moved around place to place at needed or found to be desirable. In contrast to the conventional practices as exemplified in U.S. Pat. No. 4,173,947 where fan or blowers are permanently mounted in animal husbandry buildings, the present invention provides a relatively large self-contained and totally mobile fan. Its applications include the following advantages: 1. Cooling broiler and turkey houses during the critical periods just before &#34;catch-out&#34;. This is particularly valuable during the hot summer months when mortalities of the birds climb and feed conversion plummets. The term &#34;catch-out&#34; refers to the process wherein the grown poultry ready to be marketed are manually caught by the legs and caged for subsequent transport to the slaughter house, where they are individually strung up on a line, stunned and killed by knife. 2. Ventilating poultry houses during &#34;catch-out&#34; process. Workers in these places are provided with safer, more pleasant environment and respiratory and heat related problems with catching crews are minimized. 3. Cooling birds during transport and while holding for processing, &#34;DOA&#39;s&#34; drop substantially and the birds are in a more relaxed comfortable state for &#34;hanging on the line&#34;. 4. Odors, ammonia fumes, dust and other pollutants or undesirable materials occasioned by spills around the processing plants can be minimized by the present invention which not only dilutes the hazardous ammonia fumes, but dries up the offending materials and minimizes odors therefrom. 5. Replacement parts for both the fan and the engine are readily available as may be needed during operation of the present fan assembly. As indicated above, hazardous fumes in or about poultry houses or other animal barns threaten not only the health and well being of the poultry and animals, but also that of the workers whose job it is to care for them. Furthermore, the quality of the eggs, poultry and pork produced by the chickens, turkeys and pigs is adversely affected. Such barnyard creatures are increasingly confined to close quarters or indoors, and the air therein is badly polluted by four known gases; namely, ammonia, methane, hydrogen sulphide and carbon dioxide. These gases are produced by the animals, and their manure, and they are known to cause respiratory ailments in humans as well as animals and poultry. In particular, it has been found that ammonia fumes can affect the quality of eggs in chicken houses; and that turkeys suffer lung damage even from low levels of ammonia in or about the turkey farm structures. Federal and state regulators, the poultry industry, and the unions are becoming increasingly concerned about the well-documented respiratory and skin difficulties faced by poultry catchout crews. The present invention proposes to deal with these problems.",

    "abstract": "The present inventors have developed a shutter system that controls the instantaneous intensity of the ion beam and thus that need not entirely, or at all, rely on time accumulation to vary average intensity. Instead, in the invention, a set of shutters each blocks different latitudinally separate beamlets of an area beam by varying longitudinal amounts. The area beam is then refocused to a fan beam and this refocusing process blurs the image of the shutter to provide for uniform proton intensity within the beamlet area. The result is a set of beamlets having uniform ion intensity within the beamlet and whose instantaneous ion intensities (as opposed to average intensities) may be continuously varied. Multiple adjacent shutters are used to provide similar control on adjacent beamlets. Specifically, the present invention provides an intensity modulator for ions, the intensity modulator having an area beam generator producing an area beam of protons. The area beam is received by an intensity modulator occluding the area of beam with a set of latitudinally adjacent ion-blocking shutters controllably extended to different longitudinal distances according to a desired intensity of each beamlet of protons. The desired intensity is obtained by controlling the portion of the area beam occluded by a given shutter. The partially occluded area beam is then collapsed in the longitudinal direction by a lens system to form a fan beam directed toward the patient. It is thus one object of the invention to provide for continuous control of instantaneous beamlet intensity within a fan beam. The intensity modulator may be combined with an energy modulator having a set of latitudinally adjacent ion attenuating wedges controllably extended to different longitudinal distances according to a desired energy of a beamlet of protons defined by a portion of the area beam occludable by a given wedge. It is thus another object of the invention to provide a system that can provide both independent instantaneous control of intensity and energy. Each wedge may be matched to a corresponding second wedge providing mirror movement to the first wedge to, in combination, present a uniform thickness of material within the fan beam. It is thus another object of the invention to provide for energy modulation that is uniform within the cross-section of the beamlet. The lens system may be a pair of quadrupole lenses aligned in rotation with respect to the other about a common axis. It is thus an object of the invention to provide for a simple lens system to produce a fan beam that minimizes the productions of neutrons. The beam generator may be a scattering foil receiving a pencil beam to spread it into an area beam. Thus it is an object of the invention to provide a simple method of converting a pencil proton beam obtained from a cyclotron or synchrotron into an area beam for modulation. The invention may provide a gantry holding the modulator for rotation of the fan beam with respect to the patient about a longitudinal axis while controllably varying the longitudinal distances of the shutters. It is thus another object of the invention to provide a treatment technique that works well with the continuous modulation that may be obtained by moving shutters, the treatment intensity sinograms used in such orbiting treatment being generally smoothly continuous to comport with achievable modulation with the shutters. These particular features and advantages may apply to only some embodiments falling within the claims and thus do not define the scope of the invention.",

    "abstract": "The present invention concerns instruments used to fit hip prostheses, and in particular to fit the cotyloid implants forming the female part of the hip joint. The first operation of the procedures habitually employed to fit a cotyloid implant is to mill a hemispherical cavity in the acetabulum, using a hemispherical milling tool. A hemispherical milling tool of this kind is described in the document EP-A-0 704 191 published after the priority date, for example, and includes a hollow substantially hemispherical dome with sharp-edged openings and an open base in which are provided radial spacer members to which a milling tool support can be fixed. The milling tool support is a handle with an external handling tube in which is journalled an operating tube in turn mounted to slide longitudinally on a drive shaft. The end of the drive shaft carries a bayonet bush, with L-shape notches at the end arranged around the terminal edge of the bush and shaped to receive and to retain the radial spacer members of the milling tool. The operating tube is attached to a sliding plate carrying locking lugs. A spring presses the operating tube and the sliding plate against the bayonet bush, in which position the locking lugs close the L-shape notches to trap the radial spacer members inserted in the L-shape notches and thereby lock the milling tool. At its other end, the operating tube has an operating ring, that the user can use to unlock the milling tool by causing the operating tube and the sliding plate to slide away from the bayonet bush. Other milling tools are described in the documents FR-A-2 281 095, EP-A-0 147 339, EP-A-0 327 509, U.S. Pat. No. 4,712,951. The tools described in all these documents have only a milling use. The second operation is to fit a test piece into the bone cavity hollowed out by the milling tool, after removing the milling tool. The test piece is the same shape as the final implant to be fitted into the cavity subsequently. The test piece is then removed and the cotyloid implant cemented in place, for example with the help of an impact tool as described in the document EP-A-0 470 912. In another operation procedure, described for example in the document EP-A-0 051 359, after a first operation identical to the formation of the hemispherical cavity in the bone using a milling tool, a metal cup is forcibly inserted into the cavity. A female test core is introduced into the metal cup, constituting an interface between the metal cup and a femoral prosthesis head. The test core is removed and the final core finally clipped into place. A first drawback of these techniques is the relative complexity of the instruments, since dedicated test parts are required. Another drawback of these techniques is that the stability of the final joint, conditioned by the orientation of the implant, remains random. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, a first problem to which the invention is addressed is that of simplifying the instruments, enabling test manoeuvring of the joint before final fixing of the prosthesis, without using separate dedicated test parts. Another problem to which the invention is addressed is that of significantly reducing the residual risks of dislocation of the final joint. The basic idea of the invention is that these residual dislocation risks are the result of the difficulty of checking and fixing the orientation of the final joint relative to the pelvis and the femoral prosthesis of the patient. The invention accordingly provides means for the easy and effective selection, checking and fixing of the orientation of the final implant relative to the pelvis and to the femoral prosthesis of the patient, faithfully reproducing the position assumed by the parts during tests. To achieve the above and other objects, instruments in accordance with the invention for fitting hip prostheses comprise a milling tool support and at least one milling tool removably attachable to the milling tool support, the milling tool having a hollow substantially hemispherical dome with sharp-edged openings and an open base in which are provided means for removably fixing the milling tool support ; the substantially hemispherical dome includes additional openings of sufficiently large size to enable checking of contact between the bottom of the cotyloid cavity hollowed out by the milling tool and the hemispherical external surface of the milling tool fitted into said cavity, the milling tool includes a central interior core attached to the substantially hemispherical dome, with an external face separated from the wall of the substantially hemispherical dome to leave a passage for bone fragments cut off by the milling tool, and with an open concentric hemispherical recess at the base of the dome and the inside diameter of which is chosen to correspond to the outside diameter of a femoral prosthesis head to be fitted, the milling tool is associated with means for temporarily fixing the milling tool into the cotyloid cavity formed. Thus the milling tool itself can constitute a test cotyl, avoiding the need for a dedicated test part. In an advantageous embodiment, the central interior core is attached to the substantially hemispherical dome by at least two radial spacer members disposed at the base of the dome, said radial spacer members can be used as attachment means of the milling tool on the milling tool support. In one embodiment, the central interior core is removable, and constituted by an attached part that can be fitted in the dome. Alternatively, the central interior core may be non-removably attached to the dome. The substantially hemispherical dome preferably includes, at its base, an interior annular peripheral rim with divergent holes in it for temporary fixing spikes. The milling tool support advantageously comprises a handle a first end of which includes attachment means for removably fastening the milling tool, and the other end of which includes a coupling end-piece enabling selective coupling to the shaft of a drive motor or to a manipulator handle.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a highly hydrous soft contact lens which has high water content and good transparency and is able to prevent stain adhesion. Further the present invention relates to a treating solution for contact lenses, more particularly, to a treating solution contact lenses such as a hard contact lens, an anhydrous soft contact lens and a hydrous soft contact lens to give stain resistance and hydrophilic nature to these lenses. 2. Description of the Prior Art The highly hydrous soft contact lens is characterized in that it gives little feeling of physical disorder to eyeballs in comparison with a hard contact lens not containing water which essentially comprises a monomer such as methyl methacrylate, and siloxanylalkyl methacrylate (Japanese Patent Publication Sho 52-33502 (1977)). As for a hydrous contact lens, a lens essentially containing 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate supplies little oxygen and gives feeling of physical disorder to eyeballs. Recently, to increase the percentage of water content, a contact lens comprising a copolymer of N-vinyl-pyrrolidone and methyl methacrylate, 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate or methacrylic acid was proposed, However, the above contact lens has disadvantage that stains are easily adhered to the lens to lower the strength and the lens grows yellowish by repeated heat treatment for sterilization. Conventionally used contact lenses may be classified into two groups, anhydrous hard or soft contact lenses and hydrous soft contact lenses. These anhydrous lenses having advantages over the hydrous lenses in terms of stability of materials and simple care are lenses principally containing methyl-methacrylate or lenses made of silicone rubber. Lately, a hard contact lens having high oxygen permeability principally containing silyl type methacrylate or fluoric type methacrylate which gives moderate effects to eyes has been used. However, the anhydrous lenses have problems that the hydrophobic surface gives feeling of physical disorder to eyeballs and has bad influence on the cells in the eyeballs. In particular, the lenses having high oxygen permeability and containing silicone or fluorine in large quantities are highly hydrophobic, and there are problems of feeling of physical disorder, lowering of adhesion properties and staining of proteins and lipids. Therefore, to change the hydrophobic surface into a hydrophilic surface, it is known to treat with plasma or chemically treat with acid or basic materials. These methods have problems in the maintenance of the hydrophilic nature, the denaturation after the treatment, and troublesome treating steps. As the other method, for example, there is a method disclosed by Japanese Patent Publication No. 48-37910 (1973) in which a contact lens is immersed into a solution containing a water-soluble polymer of polyvinyl alcohol, hydroxyethyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone or the like. There are disadvantages that hydrophilic contact lenses are not always obtained by the method and the method is not effective for prevention of stains such as proteins and lipids. In the other hand, the hydrous soft contact lenses give good fitness to eyes and have no problems. However, these lenses are hydrogel lenses principally constituting 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, vinylpyrrolidone or the like, and there are disadvantages of adhesion of proteins, lipids and the like to the lenses, and increase of bacteria for sanitary reasons, and lowered mechanical strength for increased water content. Therefore, sanitary care is commonly required for the lenses by boiling, sterilization or by using a care product such as germicides or detergent liquids. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a highly hydrous soft contact lens which has high water content of 40% and more, good mechanical strength, good stain resistance and possibility of long term fitting. Another object of the present invention is to provide a treating solution for a contact lens, the solution being capable of giving surface hydrophilic nature to anhydrous contact lenses or high water content to hydrous contact lenses, improving the fitness or feeling to eyes, and preventing the adhesion or deposit of stains of proteins and lipids. The present invention is a highly hydrous soft contact lens comprising a copolymer which contains as an ingredient a monomer having constitution similar to that of phospholipid represented by the following general formula: ##STR2## n is an integer of 1-20, and, R 2 , R 3  and R 4  are the same or different groups and alkyl or hydroxyalkyl of 1-8 carbon atoms. Further, the present invention is a treating solution for contact lenses which comprises a polymer containing is an ingredient the above monomer and a solvent which can dissolve the polymer. The present invention is embodied in the following. In the present invention, the monomer having phospholipid-like constitution which is used as an essential ingredient is a monomer represented by the above general formula (1). In the formula, n is an integer of 1-20. If n is more than 20, the hydrophilic nature of the polymer is undesirably lowered. Carbon atoms of alkyl groups of R 2  -R 4  are 1-8. If the carbon atoms are more than 8, a significant decrease of the hydrophilic nature of the polymer or polymerizability of the monomer is observed, so that such a compound is unsuitable for the use. As the monomer represented by the above general formula (1), 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl 2&#39;-(trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate, 3-(methacryloyloxy)propyl 2&#39;-(trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate, 4-(methacryloyloxy)butyl 2&#39;-(trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate, 5-(methacryloyloxy)pentyl 2&#39;-(trimethylammonio) ethyl phosphate, 6-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl 2&#39;-(trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate, 2- (methacryloyloxy)ethyl 2&#39;-( N-methyl -N,N-diethylammonio)ethyl phosphate, 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl 2&#39;-(N,N-dimethylethylammonio)ethyl phosphate, 2- (methacryloyloxy)ethyl 2&#39;-(triethylammonio)ethyl phosphate, 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl 2&#39;-(N,N-dimethylpropylammonio)ethyl phosphate, 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl 2&#39;-(N,N-dipropyl-N-methylammonio)ethyl phosphate, 2-(methacryloyloxy) ethyl 2&#39;-(tributylammonio)ethyl phosphate, 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl 2&#39;-(tricyclohexylammonio) ethyl phosphate, 2-(vinyloxy)ethyl 2&#39;-(trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate, 2-(allyloxy) 2&#39;-(trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate, 2-(p-vinylbenzyl)ethyl 2&#39;-(trimethylammonio) ethyl phosphate, 2- (vinylbenzoyloxy)ethyl 2&#39;-(trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate, 2-(styryloxy)ethyl 2&#39;-(trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate, 2-(allyloxycarbonyl)ethyl 2&#39;-(trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate, 2-(vinyloxycarbonyl)ethyl 2&#39;-(trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate, 2-(acryloylamino)ethyl 2&#39;-(trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate, 2-(allyloxycarbonylamino)ethyl 2&#39;-(trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate, (methacryloyloxy)methyloxy 2&#39;-(trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate, 2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyloxy 2&#39;-(trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate, 3-(methacryloyloxy)propyloxy 2&#39;-(tri-methyiammonio)ethyl phosphate, 2-(methacryloyloxy)isomropyloxy 2&#39;-(trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate, and 4-(methacryloyloxy)butyloxy 2&#39;-(trimethylammonio)ethyl phosphate are exemplified.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates broadly to spectral imaging and specifically to noninvasive detection of elements and/or chemicals in biological matter. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Hyperspectral imaging collects and processes information from across the electromagnetic spectrum. Hyperspectral imaging may utilize light in the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from ultraviolet to infrared light. Hyperspectral capabilities enable the recognition of different types of organisms, all which may appear as the same color to the human eye. Hyperspectral sensors differentiate objects based upon unique “fingerprints” across the electromagnetic spectrum that are known as spectral signatures and enable identification of the materials that make up a scanned object. Hyperspectral sensors collect information as a set of “images” with each image representing a range of the electromagnetic spectrum, also known as a spectral band. Such “images” may be combined to form a three dimensional hyperspectral cube for processing and analysis. Spectroscopic imagers have been developed for a variety of biomedical applications, from retinal oximeters (see W. R. Johnson, D. W. Wilson, W. Fink, M. Humayun, and G. Bearman, “Snapshot hyperspectral imaging in opthalmology,” J. Biomed. Opt., 12, 14036-14043, (2007) and J. C. Ramella-Roman, S. A. Mathews, “Spectroscopic Measurements of Oxygen Saturation in the Retina,” (IEEE J. of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics 13, 1697-1703, 2007) to evaluation of skin burn depths (see M. Soya, L. Leonardi, J. Payette, J. Fish, H. Mantsch, “Near Infrared spectroscopic assessment of hemodynamic changes in the early post-burn period,” Burns 27, 241-249 (2001) and evaluation of skin lesions (see, e.g., M. Hassan, R. Little, A. Vogel, K. Aleman, K. Wyvill, R. Yarchoan, and A. Gandjbakhche, “Quantitative assessment of tumor vasculature and response to therapy in kaposi&#39;s sarcoma using functional noninvasive imaging,” Technol. Cancer Res. Treat. 3(5), 451-457 (2004)). Depending on the application, spectroscopic imagers are completely passive (as disclosed in W. R. Johnson, D. W. Wilson, W. Fink, M. Humayun, and G. Bearman, “Snapshot hyperspectral imaging in opthalmology,” J. Biomed. Opt., 12, 14036-14043, (2007) and J. C. Ramella-Roman, S. A. Mathews, “Spectroscopic Measurements of Oxygen Saturation in the Retina,” (IEEE J. of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics 13, 1697-1703, 2007) or are able to switch through different wavelengths by tuning a wavelength dependent apparatus, as in the case for Liquid Crystals Tunable Filters (LCTF) and Acoustic Optics Tunable Filters (AOTF). Compact hyperspectral imagers based on AOTF have been developed at the Army Research Laboratory. Reports on the same are in publications N. Gupta, R. Dahmani, and K. Bennett, S. Simizu, D. R. Suhre, and N. B. Singh, “Progress in AOTF Hyperspectral Imagers,” in Automated Geo-Spatial Image and Data Exploitation, W. E. Roper and M. K. Hamilton, Eds., Proc. SPIE 4054, 30-38, (2000); N.

Choy, “Acousto-optic tunable filter based visible-to near-infrared spectropolarimetric imager,” Opt. Eng. 41, 1033-1038 (2002); 8. N. Gupta, and V. Voloshinov, “Hyperspectral Imager from Ultraviolet to Visible Using KDP AOTF,” Appl. Opt. 43, 2752-2759 (2004); N.

Gupta and D. R. Suhre, “AOTF imaging spectrometer with full Stokes polarimetric capability,” Appl. Opt. 46, 2632-2037 (2007). A number of hyperspectral imagers were built covering different spectral regions from the ultraviolet (UV) to the longwave infrared (LWIR). Such imagers can collect data at the wavelengths of interest, which is critical for hyperspectral applications because it greatly reduces the data processing requirements associated with traditional hyperspectral imaging systems using gratings and prisms where images are acquired in hundreds of bands without much flexibility. Optical tunable filter (OTF) imagers can switch among wavelengths in tens of micro-seconds, much faster than liquid crystal tunable filters (LCTF) that have 50 to 500 ms operating time. Unlike a traditional grating, prism or LCTF an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) is also a polarization sensitive device because the diffracted beams from it are orthogonally polarized. By combining the AOTF with a spectrally tunable retarder to change the polarization of incident light on the imaging system, polarization information from the scene or subject of interest can also be obtained. Portable Acousto-optical Spectrometers are disclosed in U.S. application Ser. No. 11/208,123, filed Aug. 18, 2005, which issued on May 19, 2009, as U.S. Pat. No. 7,535,617 to Gupta, et al, which is hereby incorporated by reference as though fully rewritten herein. As disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 7,535,617, the AOTF is a birefringent crystal having an acoustic transducer bonded to one face. Broad-band light radiation passing through a crystal can be diffracted into specific wavelengths by application of a radio-frequency (rf) driving signal to the crystal transducer. Among the attractive features of AOTFs are their small size, light-weight, computer-controlled operation, large wavelength tuning range, and reasonably high spectral resolution. Additionally, their operation can be made ultra-sensitive by using advanced signal-processing algorithm. A number of different crystals, i.e., quartz, LiNbO3, etc., allow collinear diffraction of light with either longitudinal or shear acoustic wave propagation. Chang generalized the design of an AOTF cell by introducing the concept of a noncollinear AOTF using tellurium dioxide (TeO 2 ), a birefringent crystal (a crystal having two refractive indices) that cannot exhibit collinear interaction because of its crystal symmetry. In a noncollinear AOTF cell the incident light, the diffracted light, and the acoustic wave do not travel in the same direction. An AOTF is essentially a real-time programmable filter whose operation can be described as follows. When white light is incident on the filter, it passes only a selected number of narrow bands corresponding to the applied rf-signals. The filter can be used to pass light with either a single wavelength or multiple wavelengths, depending upon the number of applied rf-signals. Either a collinear or a non-collinear geometry can be used in designing an AOTF cell, based on the symmetry properties of the anisotropic crystal under consideration. The incident light is linearly polarized by a polarizer in front of the crystal before it enters the AOTF cell. As this polarized light passes through the cell, it is diffracted in the same direction by a diffraction grating set up by the collinearly traveling sound wave. Owing to conservation of energy, the frequency of the diffracted light is Doppler shifted, but this frequency shift is insignificant and can be ignored. Based on conservation of momentum, a tuning relationship can establish between the center wavelength of the filter and the applied rf-signal. Many excellent review articles on AOTF technology and applications are available, for example see Gottlieb, M. S., “Acousto-optic tunable filter,” Design and Fabrication of Acousto-Optic Devices, A. P. Goutzoulis and D. R. Pape, eds., Marcel Dekker, New York, 1994, pp. 197-283; Gupta, N., ed., Proceedings of the First Army Research Laboratory Acousto-Optic Tunable Filter Workshop, Army Research Laboratory, ARL-SR-54 (1997); and Gupta, N. and Fell, N. F., Jr., “A compact collinear Raman spectrometer,” Talanta 45, 279-284 (1997). A more complete description is found at N. Gupta, “Biosensors Technologies-Acousto-Optic Tunable Filter based Hyperspectral and Polarization Imagers for Fluorescence and Spectroscopic Imaging,” in “Methods in Biotechnology,” edited by Avraham Rasooly and Keith E. Herold by the Humana Press Inc., Totowa, N.J., page 293-305, (November 2008). An example of a spectrometer using AO crystal cells is found in U.S. Pat. No. 5,120,961 entitled “High sensitivity acousto-optic tunable filter spectrometer,” hereby incorporated by reference, which teaches of using an acousto-optical filter (AOTF) device in a spectrometer. This spectrometer operates by using continuous wave RF-excitation through the crystal, wherein the spectrometer provides control and modulation of the RF-source. Noise is minimized by a lock-in amplifier that demodulates the modulation frequency. Fiber optics are used to connect the crystal to the source, and the source to the detection system. One AOTF-based imager operates from the visible to the near infrared (400-800 nm). See N. Gupta, R. Dahmani, and S. Choy, “Acousto-optic tunable filter based visible-to near-infrared spectropolarimetric imager,” Opt. Eng. 41, 1033-1038 (2002), hereby incorporated by reference. This imager operates in a passive mode by detecting the light either reflected or transmitted by an object. By using an electronically tunable liquid crystal variable retarder (LCVR) as a function of wavelength in the path of the incident light on the AOTF, the imagers are shown to detect both spectral and polarization signatures. In the article, a compact, lightweight, robust, and field-portable spectropolarimetric imager is developed to acquire spectropolarimetric images both in the laboratory and outdoors. The described imager used a tellurium dioxide (TeO2) acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) as an agile spectral selection element and a nematic liquid-crystal variable retardation (LCVR) plate as a tunable polarization selection device with an off-the-shelf chargecoupled device (CCD) camera and optics. The spectral range of operation was from 400 to 800 nm with a 10-nm spectral resolution at 600 nm. Each spectral image was acquired with two retardation values corresponding to the horizontal and vertical incident polarizations. The operation of the imager and image acquisition was computer controlled. For a further description of the instrument and its operation and present results of measurements, see the N. Gupta, et al., “Acousto-optic tunable filter based visible-to near-infrared spectropolarimetric imager,” Opt. Eng. 41, 1033-1038 (2002), hereby incorporated by reference. Turning to the medical field, currently an estimate of the oxygen saturation in the blood of a human body can be made with a clip that fits on the subject&#39;s finger. The clip operates by shining a light through the subject finger; and a detector measures the light that comes through the other side. The machine functions on the basis that oxygen saturated blood cells absorb and reflect light differently than those that are not. Blood cells are a bright red when they are loaded with oxygen, and they change to a bluish color when they are no longer carrying a full load. Such machines give only a rough estimate a body&#39;s oxygen saturation and its measurement can be affected such things as red nail polish on the finger. A more accurate test for measuring oxygen saturation of the blood is an arterial blood gas test; commonly obtained using a blood sample, however, such tests require the availability of the subject&#39;s blood and time for the analysis. The measurement of the oxygen deficiency in the blood is an indicator of hypoxia oxygen deficiency, which occurs when there is an inadequate supply of oxygen to tissue. An inadequate supply of oxygen to tissue may be the result of a variety of factors, including an impairment or reduction in partial pressure of oxygen, inadequate oxygen transport, or the inability of the tissues to use oxygen. Reduction of the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood (or adequately oxygenated blood) due to circulation, liver, or heart disorders, causes tissue death. Conversely, oxygen deficiency in the body tissue is an indicator for disease, poisoning, and resulting death of tissue. Brain cells are extremely sensitive to oxygen deficiency and can begin to die within five minutes. Causative factors such as drowning, strangling, choking, suffocation, cardiac arrest, head trauma, and carbon monoxide poisoning can create conditions leading to cerebral hypoxia, which can lead to coma, seizures, and even brain death. Similarly, carbon monoxide and cyanide poisoning may lead to histotoxic hypoxia, which is the inability of body tissues to use oxygen. Also, certain narcotics will prevent oxygen use by the tissues. Conversely, lack of the presence of oxygen in body tissue may be indicative of poisoning, chemicals, or certain narcotic usage. Hypoxia may lead to a complete absence of oxygen in tissue or anoxia; a condition where the metabolism of cells is disrupted causing tissue cells to die within minutes. In situations where common diagnostic procedures are not available or inadvisable to determine the medical condition of a human body, remote diagnosis (which does not involve human contact or contamination) based upon oxygen deficiency may be advantageous. Accordingly, there exists a need to determine blood oxygen content in body tissue without exposing others to potential diseases, biological agents, radiation hazards, or the causative factors of the oxygen deficiency.

    "abstract": "The field of the present invention relates generally to card games useful for playing in casinos, cardrooms and other card game locations. More specifically, this invention relates to chance card games that are bingo-like in nature and which require the participant to match cards with cards or numbers selected by the dealer. Many different types of card games are played throughout the world. Some of these games are specifically designed to be played in a casino or cardroom location whereby the participant attempts to win money, most often designated by playing chips, and the casino or cardroom makes money off each game or hand that is played. The most common of these types of games are Poker and Blackjack, which are both played with one or more decks of standard playing cards. For many people, however, these and other casino and cardroom card games can be very intimidating due to the complexities of the rules or the need to have a certain level of skill in order to have a realistic chance of winning. As a result, many people do not participate in these types of card games at all. In contrast to the above-mentioned card games, many people participate in lottery draws, bingo games and the like where the chances of winning are not dependent upon skill and knowledge of the game. Many people prefer these types of games because they provide every participant with an equal chance of winning, notwithstanding the differences between the participants with regard to skill and knowledge. In particular, bingo games have become very popular as a form of entertainment and a way for persons without much background or experience in card games to play games of chance. Generally, games involving primarily chance, such as bingo games, are not played at casinos and cardrooms. In part, this is due to the set-up of the bingo games, which generally require each player to have a bingo card, a caller to call out the numbers and a machine or other device to generate the numbers which are matched on the bingo cards. However, it would benefit casinos and cardrooms to offer a bingo-type card game to attract persons not interested in or capable of playing the more skill and knowledge orientated card games, including those persons who are the partners of persons playing the more difficult games. As a result, the number of participants and, therefore, the income for the casino or cardroom could increase. One such game, patented as U.S. Pat. No. 5,816,577 to Preston, is referred to as Bingo Poker or the like. As played, this game utilizes two decks of standard playing cards (52 cards comprising four suits with thirteen cards in each suit) and is generally played with ten players. Each player antes four chips into the center of the table and the dealer deals three cards to each player from a mixed deck of cards. Each hand is ranked by standard poker rules and the highest ranked hand is designated as such. From a second standard deck of cards, which by its nature matches the first deck of cards, the dealer begins turning over cards one card at a time. If the number or value (i.e., face cards) of one of the dealer&#39;s cards matches the number or value of one of the player&#39;s cards, the dealer places one of the chips from the ante pot on top of that card. The dealer then continues turning over cards from the dealer&#39;s deck until one of the players has a chip on each of his or her three cards or until the dealer turns over nine cards. If after nine cards have been played by the dealer none of the player&#39;s have a chip on each of their cards, the player with the designated highest poker hand wins the chips remaining in the ante. Several limitations exist with regard to the game as described and played pursuant to the Preston patent. One major limitation is on the limited amount of involvement by the player. In that game, the only activity for the player is to turn over his or her cards. All the rest is performed by the dealer, including placing the chip on the cards. Another limitation is that by utilizing a standard deck of cards (52 cards), there will generally be a substantial number of cards not played and for which there will be no matches, which creates the need to rank the cards by poker rules to speed the game up and make it interesting. There exists a need for a card game based on the concept of bingo-type matching that utilizes player participation, limited excess cards and which is compatible with standard poker tables. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The method of playing a matching card game of the present invention solves the problems identified above. The present invention discloses a card game that is a bingo-type matching card game that, in its preferred embodiment, requires player participation, has limited excess or unmatched cards and can be played on standard nine-player card tables. In the preferred embodiment, two partial standard playing card decks are utilized. The present invention overcomes the problems found in prior art card games, particularly those requiring knowledge and skill with regard to the relative complex rules and ranking systems of most casino and cardroom games. The present invention can be a good compliment to the typical casino and cardroom games for persons who are not interested in or capable of playing those games requiring higher knowledge and skill levels. The method of playing a matching card game of the present invention utilizes two sets of cards, a first set and a second set, wherein the cards of the first set match the values of the cards of the second set. Although any number of cards can be used in each set, the preferred embodiment comprises 27 cards in each of the first and second set of cards. The first and second sets can be made up of standard playing cards wherein two complete suits, having 13 cards in each suit, and one joker are utilized to make up the 27 cards in each set. For instance the first set can comprise a complete set of spades and heart suits and one joker. The second set should also comprise a complete set of spades and heart suits and one joker so the second set of cards is identical to the first set of cards. Preferably, the card game of the present invention is played on a standard nine-player card table utilized by most present day casinos and cardrooms. Nine players sit at the table and each person antes up the required ante, which can be three chips each. After shuffling the first set of cards, the dealer deals three cards, one at a time, to each player face down in front of the player from the first set of cards, thereby utilizing all 27 cards. After all the cards are dealt, each player turns over his or her three cards and places a chip on the top or “pot” side (i.e., the center of the table) of the card. After shuffling the second set of cards, the dealer begins revealing one card at a time from the top of the second set of cards. As the match cards are revealed, the dealer announces the value of the card and the players check to see if their card matches the suit and value of the match card revealed by the dealer from the second set. If so, the player takes the chip from the top side of the card and places it on top of their matching card. The dealer keeps turning over one card at a time from the second set until one player has matched all three of his or her cards (i.e., a chip on each card in front of them). All of the matched chips, those on top of a card, stay with the player whose card matched. All of the unmatched chips go into the pot, from which the casino or cardroom takes its cut and the dealer receives his tip. The remainder of the pot is distributed to the winner, the person with three matched cards. The first set and second set are either gathered and re-shuffled or discarded and new decks obtained so the game can begin again. By requiring a separate ante and the player to place his or her own chip on the cards in front of them, the game creates larger pots (dependant on the ante) and requires player involvement. The player feels as though he or she is more of a participant than a spectator, as can be with other matching card games. By using the standard nine-player card table and standard playing cards, casinos and cardrooms are not required to purchase new equipment or machinery in order to offer the card game according to the present invention. Accordingly, the primary objective of the present invention is to provide a matching card game that is a new card game requiring more chance than skill or game knowledge, thereby giving each player an equal chance to win. It is also an important objective of the present invention to provide a matching card game that is relatively easy to learn to play, yet provides player involvement. It is also an important objective of the present invention to provide a matching card game that utilizes equipment and materials commonly utilized in casinos and cardrooms to make it relatively inexpensive for casinos and cardrooms to offer. It is also an important objective of the present invention to provide a matching card game that utilizes two matching sets of cards having 27 cards in each set.",

    "abstract": "The present application relates to surgical fasteners and devices for approximating and fastening tissue and, more particularly, to suture anchors, knotting elements, and associated devices for endoscopically suturing tissue. Endoscopic microsurgery, including procedures performed by way of endoscopic instruments such as gastroscopes, colonoscopes, laparoscopes, and the like, may be preferred as an alternative to open surgery due to the many advantages attributed to such “minimally invasive” techniques, such as shortened hospital stays, reduced recovery time, reduced risk of complications, and diminishment of the amount of and/or visibility of scarring caused by a surgical intervention. In many endoscopic procedures, as in open surgery, there are instances where a surgeon may desire to repair damaged or diseased tissues by apposing the tissues together using a suture. However the suturing devices, stapling devices, and other fastener applicators that have been developed to aid surgeons performing open surgery generally cannot be easily redesigned to be passed through a flexible endoscopic instrument, which may have a working channel having an internal diameter in the range of about 2.5 to about 4.0 millimeters. In addition, surgeons performing endoscopic procedures generally cannot simultaneously manipulate multiple devices fed through such working channels with sufficient ease to permit them to routinely emulate the “pass and catch” suturing techniques that may be employed in open surgery. To address these problems, various suture anchors and applicator devices have been developed to permit surgeons to endoscopically emplace sutures within tissues. Such suture anchors may be deployed using applicator devices that are inserted within and extended through the working channel of an endoscope, carrying a suture anchor to the site of repair. Such applicators typically include a cannulated needle portion which permits the surgeon to penetrate the tissues adjacent to diseased or damaged tissue and deploy the suture anchor within, or preferably onto a distal surface of, the tissue to be apposed in a repair. The suture anchor is generally attached to a distal end of a suture, with the bulk of the suture extending alongside or within a portion of the applicator device, and with a proximal end of the suture trailing outside the endoscopic instrument. The surgeon may deploy multiple suture anchors around the site of repair by serially passing multiple applicators through a flexible endoscope to the site of repair, or by repeatedly passing and withdrawing a single applicator that may be serially reloaded with additional suture anchors. After deploying the suture anchors, the surgeon may appose the tissue by applying traction to the proximal ends of the sutures, thereby manipulating the suture anchors and the surrounding tissue, and secure the apposed tissue by advancing a series of half hitches towards the site of repair using a knot pusher device. Alternately, the surgeon may thread the trailing ends of the sutures through one of a number of types of knotting elements and associated knotting element applicators, feed the applicator through the flexible endoscope towards the apposed tissue, and “fire” the applicator to fix or “knot” the sutures in place with the knotting element. The reader will appreciate that such procedures may require the repeated insertion, operation, and withdrawal of multiple endoscopic devices, which may increase the complexity of the endoscopic procedure as well as the complexity of equipment inventory and management within the operating environment. Accordingly, there is a need for an applicator device that provides a means to deploy and implant multiple suture anchors without requiring repeated withdrawal of the device. In addition, there is a need for an applicator device that provides a means to knot the sutures associated with deployed suture anchors without requiring the withdrawal of an anchor applicator device and/or the substitution of a separate knotting element applicator device. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one aspect, a combination knotting element and suture anchor applicator is provided and includes a cannulated needle, a first knotting element portion releaseably engaged with the needle, a second knotting element portion also releaseably engaged with the needle, a knotting element deployment actuator that abuts the second knotting element portion, and an anchor deployment actuator in communication with the interior of the needle, wherein the knotting element deployment actuator and anchor deployment actuator are slidably manipulable from a proximal handle of the applicator, and held in a coaxial relationship with each other. The first knotting element portion may be releaseably engaged by a shear post engaged with a shear port on the cannulated needle, and the second knotting element portion may be releaseably engaged by a retaining post engaged with a detent on the cannulated needle. In another aspect, a combination knotting element and suture anchor applicator is provided and includes a cannulated needle, a first knotting element portion releaseably engaged with the needle, a second knotting element portion also releaseably engaged with the needle, a knotting element deployment actuator that abuts the second knotting element portion, and an anchor deployment actuator in communication with the interior of the needle, wherein the knotting element deployment actuator and anchor deployment actuator are slidably manipulable from a proximal handle of the applicator, and held in a coaxial relationship with each other.

    "abstract": "A support member of wigs consists of a close-fitting textile substrate adapted to the shape of the head, into which the artificial or the natural &#34;false&#34; hair is knotted. Such a support member sits on the head like a cap and entirely covers the real hair of the person wearing the wig, so that the wearer&#39;s own hair is no longer effective. In order to obtain a secure fixation of the wig on the head, it has to be tightly stretched over the head. This causes some inconvenience for the user without reliably avoiding a displacement of the wig. Moreover, the skin of the head is preventing from breathing. In order to overcome the disadvantages of wigs with a cap-like support member, hairpieces have been provided that supplement the user&#39;s own hair, which allow a combination of one&#39;s own hair and artificial or natural supplementary hair. 2. Description of the Related Art A known hair-piece (DE 1 460 165) has a support member shaped like a head calotte and having curved webs provided with hair and extending across the head transversally. Both ends of each web are fastened to a closed frame of a cap-like contour. The webs and the frame form a grid having openings transversally extending across the head and being closed all around through which a person&#39;s own hair may be drawn in order to mix the user&#39;s own hair and supplementary hair. Lateral webs are provided for reducing the size of the openings. Pulling hair through the grid openings is troublesome and requires great care and a lot of time in order to hide the frame and the webs lying on the head like a cap under the wearer&#39;s own hair. At the hairline, the frame is tongue-shaped and predetermines a shape of the hairline that does not correspond to the natural course of the hairline and cannot be adapted by the user. Hair-pieces manufactured in mass production are practically unusable, since webs and frames of plastic material have to be adapted to the individual form of a head, prior to their drying and curing, in order to obtain a certain fitting of the hair-piece. Curved webs, extending transversally across the head, are also provided in another known hair-piece (DE 14 60 168). Both ends of the webs, formed as arched members, are fastened to a lateral holding or clamping piece to be arranged behind the temple above and/or in front of the user&#39;s ear. This results in lunulate openings for the user&#39;s own hair that are very narrow in the vicinity of the ears. Pulling the wearer&#39;s own hair through the openings closed all around is not easy to be done. If the distances between the webs are widened in order to facilitate the pulling through of the hair, the thin own hair of the user would collapse too much, so that the hair-piece would be distinct from the user&#39;s own hair and no seemingly natural mixture of hair could be obtained. Dressing the hair at the front hairline is difficult, since the frontmost web spans the head above the forehead in a hoop-like manner and defines a limit line of the hair that does not correspond to a natural hairline and does not allow an adaptation to individual needs. The latter is a particularly serious problem if a person&#39;s own hair is not sufficient to cover that web. If they hold the hair-piece sufficiently tight, the two holding or clamping pieces can be painful to the user. When the hair-piece is made in mass production, a secure hold and a good fitting cannot be achieved for every head, since the distance between the crown and the ears, as well as the diameter of the head, which are decisive for a close fitting of the support member on the head and the clamping effect of the clamping pieces, are different with every individual. The known hair-piece does not allow a modification in order to adapt it to the individual shape of the head and the hairdo of the user. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It is the object of the invention to improve a hair-piece having a support member for hair, shaped like the calotte of the head and consisting of curved webs, such that it facilitates pulling the wearer&#39;s hair through the openings between the webs and provides a natural look of the mixed hair, including the hairline. This object is solved according to the invention by providing the support member as a basket of freely ending rods starting from a crown area, each pair of rods defining a space between them that continuously extends to the free ends of the rods. In this manner a spider-like structure is obtained, the rods of which, extending radially and being curved to form a basket, are pushed on the head from behind, sliding on the skin of the head with the free ends until the crown portion that practically is the bottom of the &#34;basket&#34; sits close on the head. The rods are submerged under the user&#39;s own hair already during this procedure. In order to draw all of a person&#39;s own hair out between the rods, a pointed object, e.g. a hair pin or a comb with a handle, is drawn from the hairline towards the crown area of the hair-piece, the hair in the respective space between two rods being lifted easily. This procedure can be done quickly and easily and the uniform mixture of the user&#39;s own hair and the supplementary hair is subsequently combed over the support member which results in natural looking full hair. Since the rods also end freely in the area of the hairline, this critical area is open to the front and the rods extend to the natural hairline without delimiting it transversally. The support member according to the invention even allows to run through one&#39;s fingers through the hair. Since the rods are elastically resilient in the direction of their curvature, a uniform size of the support member will fit on many different heads and span them with an even holding force, so that the hair-piece may be manufactured as a cheap mass product. Should the shape of the head, the kind of hairline or the desired hairdo require so, the rods, preferably made of plastic material, may be optionally shortened by simply cutting them off. To this avail, they are preferably flat or of a small circular diameter. Generally, the desired effect of the hair-piece is decisive for the length of the rods. Starting from the crown area, they may extend over the entire upper head or may be distributed and dimensioned such that they are only present on parts of the upper head. The crown area may be arranged eccentrically, so that it is situated in the upper region of the back of the head and that the rods extending to the front are longer than the rest of the rods. This results in a very good close fitting of the support member. Moreover, it is advantageous to have a strong hair concentration occur at the back of the head where it is often particularly desired. Should the shape of the head and the hairdo of the wearer of the hair-piece require so, the crown area may be arranged substantially centrally with respect to the rods. The crown area has a knot piece from which the rods extend in star-shape. In this case, the knot piece is e.g. a round plate from which the rods extend radially. The resulting intermediate spaces are about triangular. Since in a narrow arrangement of the rods the acute angle might hinder the drawing out of hair, longitudinal knot pieces are preferred. Such a knot piece extends across the support member and the rods extend therefrom in an almost parallel arrangement with respect to each other, so that they define almost rectangular spaces. The longitudinal knot piece is a bar member spanning the head almost on the connection line between the ends of the ear conches. The knot pieces may each have a passage for a fastening element like a hair pin or a hair grip. The knot piece and the rods extending radially therefrom may be integrally extruded from plastic material. In order to obtain a greater density of supplementary hair, a great number of rods are provided; however, a reasonable width of the spaces has to be left open for drawing the wearer&#39;s own hair through easily. The angle of the triangular spaces or the distances of parallel rods may vary, thus also allowing adaptations to different densities of the user&#39;s own hair and hairdo. A gap between rods may be provided at the back portion of the hair-piece, which has the effect that, when laying back the head, the hair piece is not pushed forward by a rod end hitting the neck. This is particularly advantageous with an eccentrically arranged crown area. It may also prove advantageous to shorten the rods in the area of the back of the head, forming a clipping, or to bend some rods apart. The hair may be fastened to the rods directly by glueing, clamping or welding. In this context, the knot piece is preferably designed as a separate member to which the rods may be detachably connected. In this way, the user of the hair-piece can regulate the desired density and/or the insertion of colored strands of supplementary hair himself by removing or adding rods. Moreover, the hair-piece may be used as a demonstration model for e.g. different colors of strands that, prior to the dying of his own hair, can give the user a good impression of the later effect and help him to choose the color. In order to arrive at the detachable connection, the knot piece may be provided as a plate having radial pockets into which the rods may be detachably inserted. A certain hold of the support member is obtained due to the insertion of the freely ending rods of the support member into a person&#39;s own hair. An additional fastening is feasible, however. To this avail, a fastening pin may be put through the passage in the knot piece into a knot of hair below the knot piece. A further possibility of fastening the support member is achieved by providing at least one longitudinal edge of at least some of the rods with barbs the openings of which face the crown area. Since these barbs are oriented towards the crown area, they do not hinder a drawing out of the wearer&#39;s own hair from the hairline towards the crown area. In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the hair may be fastened to holders connectable to the rods. These holders may preferably consist of hoses that may be slipped onto the rods. Fastening the hair to the hoses may be done by glueing, clamping and/or welding. If the hoses can be slipped onto the rods detachably, an assortment of hose ends provided with hair dyed in different colors may be associated with a support member, so that various effects of the supplementary hair may be obtained, e.g. for demonstration purposes. Moreover, fastening the hair to the hoses is expedient for reasons of production and for better transportability in the form of reeled up hoses. Preferably, the hoses are flattened and the hair is applied on their outer flat side. In this manner, the hair is closer to the skin of the head and the support surface--seen in the transversal direction of the hose--is enlarged compared to a hose of circular cross section. Slipping the hose onto the rods is facilitated by providing the inside of the hoses and the outside of the rods with a longitudinal ribbing. The rods may be curved once or several times in the plane parallel to the skin of the head. The slipped-on hoses follow that course resiliently. The hoses may be as long as the rods onto which they are slipped, or longer. In the latter case, the shorter rods projecting from the crown area are mere studs on which to slip the hoses that then act as basket-forming rods themselves.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to a compact automatic doughnut making machine adapted for use on table-top or counter-top in such places as lunch counters, delicatessens, grocery store and discount store bakery counters, small bakeries, and the like, in which doughnuts are sold in moderately large volume. Many doughnut making machines are available. Most of these have been large, bulky, expensive and adapted to produce doughnuts in large quantities, or they have been largely small manually operated units adapted for low volume production. U.S. Pat. No. 3,504,619, issued to the present inventor, discloses a compact table-top automatic doughnut making machine adapted to serve the intermediate demand for moderately large volume production at a reasonable price and not requiring floor space, heavy duty electrical connections, and other disadvantages or prior art machines. The doughnut making machine of that aforesaid patent admirably fulfills its intended function. However, many doughnutselling outlets experience large variations in demand for doughnuts from day to day and from hour to hour on the same day. The doughnut making machine of the present invention is directed to the satisfaction of this varying demand by its capability of producing doughnuts at varying rates ranging from about 5 dozen to 100 dozen doughnuts per hour. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The doughnut making machine according to the present invention includes a relatively deep generally rectangular cooking vessel adapted to contain a liquid cooking medium, such as fat or oil. The tank includes an electrical heating element whose temperature is automatically thermostatically controlled in the conventional manner for the purpose of maintaining the cooking medium at the required temperature to fry the dough. The machine is provided with a removable guide insert adapted to be partially immersed in the cooking medium and defining a circuitous serpentine path along which the doughnut floats as it is being cooked. The guide insert comprises a plurality of vertical longitudinally extending spaced apart parallel plates which define longitudinal segments of the flow path. The ends of alternate longitudinal plates are interconnected at their opposite ends by vertical arcuate plates which define arcuate flow paths connecting successive longitudinal flow paths. A removable dough extruder is movably mounted above the vessel adapted to be positioned over the upstream end of the circuitous flow path. A submerged pump is disposed in the tank at the upstream end of the flow path to circulate the cooking medium to provide the transport system for the doughnuts. To separate the circulating cooking medium providing the transport system from the remainder of the cooking medium, the guide insert is provided with a bottom wall spaced from the bottom of the tank to provide a sump for cooking medium to be collected at the discharge end of the flow path and recirculated. Approximately midway along the circuitous flow path the machine includes an automatic turning device for turning over partially cooked doughnuts. At the downstream end of the flow path there is an automatic ejector device to discharge the fully cooked doughnuts. Automatic hold-back means are provided to insure systematic one-by-one turn-over and discharge of the cooked doughnuts.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to containers for cosmetic products in which the applicator projects directly into the container and contacts the product. More particularly, it relates to containers wherein at least a portion of the wall of the container is flexible so that, upon squeezing the container, the product is forced against the applicator, thus loading the applicator with product. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Pasty cosmetics such as mascara, lip gloss, concealers, and eyeshadows are commonly sold in containers with an applicator projecting into the container and secured to the underside of the container cap. Radial or axial projections such as bristles, teeth, flocking, porous sponges, and the like, are provided on the applicator to hold cosmetic material thereon. The wall of the container is typically constructed of a rigid material which does not yield when pressure is applied. To load a sufficient amount of product onto the applicator, most consumers repeatedly move the applicator axially within the container, similar to that of a pumping action. When the consumer feels she has loaded a sufficient amount of product, she removes the applicator from the container and then applies the product. With the repeated steps of insertion and removal of the applicator, the product within the container is depleted. During this depletion, the pasty nature of the product causes the product to adhere to the internal walls of the container and form a cavity defined by the product which remains adhered to the internal walls of the container. The product on the wall of the container is generally out of reach of the applicator when inserted into the container, and as a result, the consumer cannot remove all of the product from the container without significant difficulty. Thus, most of the product within such a container remains unused by the consumer. Japanese Reference JP 9117322 proposes to solve this problem by incorporating a bag within the container. The bag is pushed by a pressure application board, which causes the applicator tip to be supplied with the cosmetic material. Various drawbacks are associated with this container. First, the incorporation of a bag within the container decreases the volume within the container and therefore decreases the amount of product which can be supplied to the consumer. Further, this proposed solution has many parts which are needed to make the package work, thus increasing manufacturing and assembly costs. This invention provides for a cosmetic container which utilizes a flexible wall to allow the consumer to load a sufficient amount of product on the applicator without having to repeatedly &#34;pump&#34; the applicator within the container. This invention also provides for a cosmetic container which allows a consumer to access a greater percentage of product within the container, thus allowing for less residual product to remain in the container. Further, this invention also provides for a cosmetic container which is simple for a consumer to use. Also, this invention provides for a cosmetic container that is a relatively simple device that avoids interference with the package aesthetics. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a container for a pasty cosmetic product which permits access by the consumer to a larger percentage of the contained product than has typically been possible in the traditional container. The present invention comprises a hollow container having a wall, wherein the wall defines an internal chamber and at least a portion of the wall is flexible. The container has a neck which provides access to the internal chamber. An applicator projects into the container and is attached to a cap which closes the container about the neck. With the repeated steps of insertion and removal of the applicator, the product within the container is depleted. During this depletion, the nature of the product causes the product to adhere to the internal surface of the container and form a cavity where the applicator has removed the product. Upon the squeezing of the wall of the container of the present invention, the product adhered to the internal surface of the container is forced against the applicator, thus removing the product from the internal surface and enabling the use of a greater amount of product with little difficulty.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to a procedure and apparatus for inserting pedicle screws into the spine as part of a spinal fixation instrument system, and particularly to a procedure whereby the likelihood of nerve damage caused by improperly placed pedicle screws can be reduced by implementing the present procedure with associated apparatus in situ. 2. Discussion of the Known Art Instances arise when it becomes necessary to stabilize or fuse a portion of the spine from motion such as, for example, (1) after decompression wherein certain posterior spinal elements are removed to relieve pressure on neural elements, (2) after trauma, or (3) because of the presence of tumors. Instrument systems that accomplish spinal fixation are known in the form of pedicle screws which are adapted to be inserted in selected vertebrae, and stiff rods or plates that connect adjacent pedicle screw heads to one another after the screws are inserted, thus resulting in the fixing or bracing of all vertebrae spanned by the rod or plate. Commercially available pedicle screws are usually made of stainless steel having overall diameters (including threads) ranging between 5.5 mm and 6.5 mm, and with lengths ranging between 25 mm and 55 mm. The pedicles are the strongest parts of the spinal vertebrae and thus provide a secure foundation for the screws to which fixing rods or plates are attached. See R. Roy-Camille, et al, Internal Fixation of the Lumbar Spine With Pedicle Screw Plating, Clinical Orthopedics (February 1986), at page 7; and H. N. Herkowitz, et al, Instrumentation of the Lumbar Spine for Degenerative Disorders, Operative Techniques in Orthopaedics (January 1991), at page 91. In order to derive the greatest mechanical integrity when anchoring pedicle screws in a spine fixing instrument system, it is therefore essential that the screws be guided and threaded in alignment with the pedicle axis and not be allowed to deviate off axis in which case the screw body or its threads will break through the vertebral cortex and impinge on or become dangerously close to surrounding nerve roots. A jig adapted for providing locations on the pedicles of a vertebra for insertion of pedicle screws, is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,907,577 (Mar. 13, 1990). The patent observes that the vertebral bodies will be fixed more stably the deeper the screws are inserted in the pedicle, and that slight deviations in the angle of screw insertion can injure nerve roots or the spinal cord. Much appears in the literature with respect to the problems of misalignment of pedicle screws and the symptoms arising when the screws make contact with neural elements after breaking outside the pedicle cortex. Cutting into a nerve root or simply contacting the root gives rise to various postoperative symptoms such as dropped foot, neurological lesions, sensory deficits, or pain. The Adult Spine--Principles and Practice, Vol. II, at pages 1937 and 2035-36 (Raven Press 1991); J. L. West, et al, Complications of the Variable Screw Plate Pedicle Screw Fixation, Spine (May 1991), at 576-79; and J. L. West, et al, Results of Spinal Arthrodesis with Pedicle Screw-Plate Fixation, Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (Sep. 1991), at 1182-83. Apart from the jig of the mentioned &#39;577 patent, no tools or devices are known with which pedicle screws can be guided or inserted into a vertebra in such a manner as to ensure that parts of the screws do not rupture the cortex and impinge on or come dangerously close to nerve roots. Current practice calls for the use of recognized landmarks along the spinal column for purposes of locating pedicle entry points, and the use of X-ray exposures or fluoroscopy to monitor the advancement of a metallic pedicle screw through the vertebra. But prolonged radiation exposure of the patient for purposes of proper screw placement is of course undesirable and this technique still has a misplacement rate of up to 21%. The Adult Spine--Principles and Practice, supra, at 2035. Nonetheless, a disturbingly high number of reported pedicle cortical disruptions has prompted one author to observe that &#34;[a]lthough pedicle disruption does not necessary cause neural deficit, keeping the screw contained within the pedicle is one sure way to prevent it.&#34; The Adult Spine--Principles and Practice, supra, at 1937. It is known generally that electrical potential pulses may be applied on or into the body of a patient for purposes of treatment. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,461,300 (Jul. 24, 1984) discloses a specially formed electrode for healing of bone or soft tissue fractures in a patient. The electrode has a lead wire connected at its back end, and is capable of being drilled or otherwise inserted into the patient&#39;s body with the lead wire in place. It is also known that muscular reactions to electrical stimulation can be observed while a procedure is continued in accordance with the observed reactions. U.S. Pat. No. 2,808,826(Oct. 8, 1957) shows electro-diagnostic apparatus and associated circuitry that act as a stimulator to measure the excitability of muscle or nerve tissue. A pair of electrodes are placed across a part of the patient&#39;s body and short duration pulses are applied with the pulse amplitude being slowly increased until a visible contraction appears. Electrical current readings are obtained for pulses of increasing duration, and a curve called a &#34;strength-duration&#34; curve is obtained, according to the patent. U.S. Pat. No. 4,824,433 (Apr. 25, 1989) discloses a puncturing and catheterizing device with a metal puncture needle and cannula suitable for puncturing nerve tracts. With the device connected to an electrical pulser, as long as the needle and surrounding cannula are inserted in the body through a nerve sheath, current pulses applied to the device induce visible motor reactions on body parts such as the hand. The visible reactions allow the physician to know that the puncture needle and cannula are being passed correctly along a space between a nerve and the nerve sheath. Until applicant&#39;s invention, no technique, procedure or device was known that utilized visible motor reactions of a patient&#39;s limbs as a means for determining if a pedicle screw to be inserted in the patient&#39;s spine might impinge on or come in dangerously close proximity to a nerve root. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to overcome the above and other shortcomings in the prior art with respect to the location, placement and insertion of pedicle screws as part of a spine fixation instrument system in a patient. Another object of the invention is to enable a surgeon to know, in situ, if a pedicle screw has (1) penetrated the cortex of a pedicle, (2) touched a nerve root, or (3) come in such close proximity to a nerve root as to require withdrawal and re-insertion of the screw. A further object of the invention is to avoid the requirement of a new operation on a patient by ensuring that screw members stay contained within selected pedicles when a spine fixation instrument system is first applied in the patient. Another object of the invention is to enable screw members forming part of an orthopaedic fixation instrument system to be inserted into a patient&#39;s bone tissue safely and without the requirement of continuous or frequent radiation exposure to ensure proper screw member alignment. Yet another object of the invention is to reduce appreciably instances of postoperative complications such as dropped foot, neurological lesions, sensory deficits, or pain following surgery involving placement of screw members in a patient&#39;s spine. According to the invention, a surgical tool for forming an opening in bone tissue for insertion of a screw member, comprises a tool handle and a probe member extending from the handle. The probe member has a tip adapted to work an opening in the bone tissue. Stimulator circuit means connected to the probe member produces an electric stimulation potential of a predetermined magnitude, and applies the stimulation potential to the tip of the probe member while the tool handle is grasped and the tip is directed toward the bone tissue.",

    "abstract": "It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a process and composition for the mineralization of brewed beverages during the brewing process. It is also an object of the invention to provide a process and composition which not only provides for the mineralization of brewed beverages, but also provides for the maximum flavor extraction from the minimum amount of beverage base being brewed. These and other objects may be accomplished by admixing a particular form of the beverage base to be brewed with a minor amount of a finely divided mineral source consisting of a hydrated aluminum silicate base also containing minor amounts of other minerals selected from the group consisting of calcium, magnesium and iron, and mixtures thereof in a naturally occurring form. This mixture is placed in a filter medium, such as on a coffee filter or in a tea bag, and then treated with hot water as in a conventional brewing process. The finely divided mineral source is first thoroughly mixed with a beverage base such as ground coffee. A measured amount is placed on a filter medium as in the regular brewing process, and hot water is added. Normally, the brewing water is retained by the filter only long enough to extract the more water-soluble coffee solids. In the present invention, the brewing water extracts the more soluble coffee solids and the water soluble mineral salts contained in the mineral source. Also, a minor portion of the mineral source has a particle size sufficiently small that such mineral particles pass through the filter along with the dissolved coffee and mineral solids. A major portion of the finely divided mineral is retained on the surface of the filter and retards the rate of flow through the filter. This allows greater extraction of flavor from the ground coffee and, therefore, smaller amounts of coffee can be used to obtain the same flavor normally found in using larger amounts. In addition, the minerals added to the brewed coffee significantly enhance the flavor. Since smaller amounts of coffee may be used to obtain the same flavor with approximately the same coffee solids content, the color of the brewed coffee may be lighter. It may, therefore, be desirable to add a coloring agent such as caramel powder to the mixture of ground coffee and finely divided mineral source. In addition, other flow-reducing agents such as modified starches may be added to the ground coffee, mineral source blend. Modified starch is water insoluble, but swells in the presence of hot water to form a matrix on top of the filter and retarding the flow rate of brewed beverage through the filter. The invention, as summarized above, will now be described in detail. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Since brewed beverages have little caloric value, except when used with additives such as cream, milk and sugar, they are consumed primarily for taste or medicinal effects. Quality blends of coffee or tea are more costly than cheaper, more abundant blends. Without resorting to additives which affect flavor, such as cream and sugar, there are basically two ways to obtain maximum flavor quality. The first is to extract as much quality flavor from a beverage base as is possible and the second is to have a quality water in the brewed beverage. The present invention is drawn to both facets and accomplishes both through a unique brewing process. As already mentioned, the primary cations found in quality spring water are usually calcium, magnesium and iron. The anions associated with these metal cations are usually bicarbonate and sulfate. However, oxides, carbonates, phosphates, chlorides and other anions may also be present. Other minerals in trace form such as boron, fluorine, barium, copper, cobalt, zinc, nickel, aluminum, manganese, silver and many others may also be present. Some, which are insoluble, are present in extremely finely divided particulate form as colloids. Water treatment plants often remove many of the minerals that improve water flavor when removing undesirable bacteria, waste and other foreign materials. Ion exchange resins used in water treatment to soften water add excessive amounts of sodium and potassium to water. Also, heating water to boiling or near boiling removes many more minerals as well as desirable gases such as air. The key feature of the present invention is a method to replace as many of the desirable minerals as possible to the water of a brewed beverage. It has now been found that many naturally occurring minerals, such as some clays, contain the appropriate minerals and can be utilized to mineralize hot waters if added to such waters under appropriate conditions, and after such hot waters have begun their cooling process. Clay is defined as a hydrated aluminum silicate which may also contain other minerals. There are myriad kinds and qualities of clays which vary greatly in chemical composition and particle size. There may also be other mineral combinations of alumina and silica such as finely divided igneous rocks, shale, sandstone and sedimentary deposits which could also be used, provided they have the appropriate chemical makeup. For purposes of the present invention, both chemical makeup of the mineral and particle size are important. Besides being primarily composed of an aluminum silicate, it is important that the mineral source contain calcium, magnesium and iron. Since the eight most prevalent elements in the earth&#39;s crust are, in order, oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium and magnesium, it would seen that the chemical makeup requirement could be easily satisfied.

    "abstract": "This invention is in the field of corn breeding, specifically relating to an hybrid corn plant and seed designated 3531. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field crops are bred through techniques that take advantage of the plant&#39;s method of pollination. A plant is self-pollinated if pollen from one flower is transferred to the same or another flower of the same plant. A plant is cross-pollinated if the pollen comes from a flower on a different plant. Corn plants (Zea mays L.) can be bred by both self-pollination and cross-pollination techniques. Corn has separate male and female flowers on the same plant, located on the tassel and the ear, respectively. Natural pollination occurs in corn when wind blows pollen from the tassels to the silks that protrude from the tops of the incipient ears. The development of a hybrid corn variety involves three steps: (1) the selection of plants from various germplasm pools; (2) the selfing of the selected plants for several generations to produce a series of inbred lines, which, although different from each other, breed true and are highly uniform; and (3) crossing the selected inbred lines with unrelated inbred lines to produce the hybrid progeny (F 1 ). During the inbreeding process in corn, the vigor of the lines decreases. Vigor is restored when two unrelated inbred lines are crossed to produce the hybrid progeny. An important consequence of the homozygosity and homogeneity of the inbred lines is that the hybrid between a defined pair of inbreds will always be the same. Once the inbreds that give a superior hybrid have been identified, the hybrid seed can be reproduced indefinitely as long as the homogeneity of the inbred parents is maintained. Hybrid corn seed can be produced by manual detasseling. Alternate strips of two inbred varieties of corn are planted in a field, and the pollen-bearing tassels are removed from one of the inbreds (female). Providing that there is sufficient isolation from sources of foreign corn pollen, the ears of the detasseled inbred will be fertilized only from pollen from the other inbred (male), and the resulting seed is therefore hybrid and will form hybrid plants. The laborious detasseling process can be avoided by using male-sterile inbreds. Plants of these inbreds are fertilized with pollen from another inbred that is not male-sterile. Pollen from the second inbred can contribute genes that make the hybrid plants male-fertile. Usually seed from detasseled normal corn and male sterile produced seed of the same hybrid is blended to insure that adequate pollen loads are available for fertilization when the hybrid plants are grown. The objective of commercial maize hybrid line development programs is to develop new inbred lines to produce hybrids that combine to produce high grain yields and superior agronomic performance. The primary trait breeders seek is yield. However, other major agronomic traits are of importance in hybrid combination and have an impact on yield or otherwise provide superior performance in hybrid combinations. Such traits include percent grain moisture at harvest, relative maturity, resistance to stalk breakage, resistance to root lodging, grain quality, and disease and insect resistance. In addition the lines per se must have acceptable performance for parental traits such as seed yields, kernel sizes, pollen production, all of which affect ability to provide parental lines in sufficient quantity and quality for hybridization. These traits have been shown to be under genetic control and many if not all of the traits are affected by multiple genes.",

    "abstract": "We have devised an apparatus for solving the above problems wherein the product may be fried and mixed simultaneously, new ingredients may be added during frying and overheated frying oil is not formed. According to the present invention there is provided a fryer comprising: a tray for containing a frying oil on its surface and a product to be surface fried, means for conveying and mixing the product horizontally from an inlet position to an outlet position and simultaneously cleaning the frying surface of the tray, means for heating the frying oil, and means for controlling the period of time during which the product contacts the frying oil in order to obtain a fried surface of the product. The present invention also provides a process for surface-frying a food product which comprises conveying the food product horizontally from an inlet position to an outlet position in a tray whose surface is coated with frying oil while simultaneously mixing the product and cleaning the frying surface of the tray and controlling the period of time during which the product contacts the frying oil in order to obtain a fried surface of the product. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION In the apparatus embodiments of the present invention and for carrying out the process of the present invention, the tray may be made of any material suitable for a frying process, e.g. a metal such as steel. It is preferably elongated in shape and may be in the form of a shallow trough, the frying surface of which is concave in cross-section. Preferably, the tray is adapted to remain stationary or substantially stationary during frying of the product. The means for heating the frying oil may be achieved by the provision of a double wall in the tray through which hot oil flows. The hot oil may be heated either by a heat exchanger connected to steam under pressure, e.g. 20 bars, or directly from an oil burner. Preferably, the double will does not extend above the level of the product within the tray in order to protect the frying oil from overheating on the surface of the tray which would not be covered by the product. One means for conveying and mixing the product may be, for example, provided by a shaft fitted with angled paddles in a helical arrangement extending from an inlet end to an outlet end within the tray and adapted to rotate so that their edges contact and scrape the frying surface of the tray. The paddles are advantageously slightly curved so that their edges which contact the frying surface of the tray will transport the product and clean the frying surface of the tray by scraping. The rotation of the shaft forces the product from the inlet position to the outlet position and also enables mixing of the product by the action of the paddles. In addition, the scraping action of the edges of the paddles on the frying surface of the tray enables the frying surface to remain clean. Means for rotating the shaft may be provided by a drive motor attached to one end of the shaft. The means for controlling the period of time during which the product remains in contact with the frying oil in order to achieve a fried surface of the product may be provided by a discontinuous movement of the rotation of the shaft. The discontinuous movement may be achieved, for instance, by a computer connected to the drive motor and may be adjusted according to the nature of the product to be fried. The discontinuous rotation helps to achieve a fried surface on the product. The speed of the rotation is not critical but may be chosen according to the mixing capacity and/or the fragility of the product and may be, for instance, from 5 to 100 and preferably from 10 to 50 RPM. The duration of each period of discontinuous rotation of the shaft is not critical but is usually from 5 to 60 seconds, e.g. from 10 to 40 seconds. Each period of rotation may be separated by a period of from 10 seconds to 5 minutes, preferably from 30 seconds to 3 minutes during which time the shaft is stationary. An alternative means for conveying and mixing the product may be provided by a central axle adapted to rotate and extending horizontally from a tray inlet end to an outlet end fitted with a plurality of plates, or wings, projecting substantially perpendicularly from the central axle and positioned at an angle in the perpendicular plane so that on rotation of the axle, the movement of a plate transports the product a certain distance corresponding to the width of the angle. The alternative means may also comprise a scraper to clean the frying surface, a mixing plate to lift and turn the product while rotating and a level-out system, such as an articulated level-out system positioned on the opposite side of the axle to the plates or wings, to maintain a desired thickness of the product layer on the frying surface of the tray. In this embodiment, the tray preferably consists of two double jacketed tubs in two levels, preferably tightly mounted to each other, each tub being separately heated with thermal oil. The downstream tub is preferably at a lower level to the upstream tub. The central axles in each tub are adapted to rotate clockwise and anti-clockwise and are separately driven, e.g. by two computer controlled servo-motors. Advantageously, the plates or wings in the downstream tub are mounted at a narrower angle in the perpendicular plane than the plates in the upstream tub and therefore one rotation of the central axle transports the product less distance in the downstream tub than in the upstream tub. This arrangement in the downstream tub therefore requires more turns than the arrangement in the upstream tub to transport the food product a specified distance in the tray, e.g. 1.5 to 2.5 turns and preferably 1.75 to 2.25 turns of the central axle in the downstream tub are required to transport the product the same distance as one turn of the central axle in the upstream tub. The reason why the tray is divided into two parts with the plates in the downstream tub mounted at a narrower angle than those in the upstream tub is because it is necessary that the product lies still on the frying surface of the tray for specified periods during frying in order to achieve an attractive browning. During frying the product becomes hotter and therefore the resting time on the frying surface of the tray should preferably be shorter in order to avoid burned and/or destroyed portions. The plates are each conveniently segments of an ellipsoid plane section, preferably from 1/5 to 1/2 and more preferably from 2/9 to 4/9 of the ellipsoid plane section. The plates are preferably connected to one another by means of one or more connecting rods or stay tubes to give stability. Generally, the frying oil is added to the tray and heated to the frying temperature before the product is added. The amount of frying oil added to the tray depends on the product but may be from 0.5 to 10%, usually from 1 to 6% and more usually from 1.5 to 4% by weight based on the weight of product being fried. Examples of products which may be fried by the apparatus and process of this invention include meat balls, diced potatoes and products containing a mixture of ingredients such as the Swedish &#34;Pyttipanna&#34; or Chinese types of stir fries. When a product contains a mixture of ingredients which require different frying times, it is easy to add the ingredients which require shorter frying times at the appropriate position between the inlet and outlet positions of the tray. The process of the present invention may be carried out batchwise or continuously. In both batchwise and continuous processes the product can be added simply by dropping it into the tray. In a batchwise process, the batches may conveniently be weighed manually and added by a semi-automatic device such as a screw feeder. In a continuous process, weighing belts may be used to add the product to the tray.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to an intravaginal device (IVD) and more particularly to such device as means for introducing medicaments into the vagina of a human female. 2. Description of the Prior Art To facilitate normal function or to assist in the recovery and restoration of tissues and organs that have deteriorated from traumatic or systemic changes, injury or infection, it is sometimes desirable to enhance the tone, health or function of the vagina, cervix and related organs and tissues through biological, chemical and/or physical action. In this connection, it is sometimes desirable to apply lubricants, medicines, topical anesthetics or other desensitizers, antiseptics, conditioners or other medicaments to the vagina. Accordingly, various techniques have been developed to achieve such ends. For example, skin patches, injections and oral administration have been employed to medicate the targeted tissues. Such methods suffer from a variety of drawbacks including the involvement of entire body systems, the necessity for the frequent engagement of medically trained personnel, inconvenience and the absence of direct physical action on the affected tissues. Many women have found other conventional methods involving topical applications by means of reusable syringes inconvenient and uncomfortable. Such methods also typically require the user to lie down for application and tend to be unsanitary and messy in that the reusable syringe must be cleaned and the medicament and/or its carrier tends to leak from the vagina. Prior art methods suffer from other disadvantages as well. In particular, it is noted that the walls of the vagina in its normal relaxed state comprise a number of folds of skin. Thus, medicaments applied according to conventional techniques tend to miss areas of the walls. Further, such techniques do not generally provide the maximum benefits that can be obtained by physical action directly on the tissues. The prior art devices can be considered in three connections. The first of them is the type of device that is essentially contraceptive as represented by U.S. Pat. No. 4,553,965. Such devices consist of a tampon that can be inserted into the vagina and near the cervix and also a separate removable receptacle for liquids of a contraceptive nature that is injected into the tampon prior to its insertion into the vagina. Contraceptive devices obviously differ in several respects from the present case, and they must not be of such a nature to interfere with normal sexual intercourse. A second type of device is the menstrual tampon that is primarily designed for preventing menstrual flow from escaping from the vagina during menses. These devices typically are not designed to supply medicaments to the vagina. These devices may be squeezed to a small size and expand when inserted thereby to seal off the Sometimes such devices have some form of medicament present but they are basically inapplicable to the invention of the present application. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,618,605 is a device made of elongated material that is folded up. The device contains no shield and no means of introducing medicaments at the time it is inserted. See also U.S. Pat. No. 3,731,687. U.S. Pat. No. 3,762,413 is basically the same type of device as the previously mentioned ones, save only that it provides means for mechanically expanding it. U.S. Pat. No. 3,791,385 includes a tube for admitting air to the interior of the device when it is desired to remove it. The third class consists of devices that are actually designed to supply medicaments to the vagina. Such devices are represented by the U.S. Pat. No. 1,401,358 to Peterkin. This device is not supplied with a shield of the type employed in the present invention, and must be inserted by forceps. The device of Rolfson-Schmidt U.S. Pat. No. 880,469 is similar to that of the foregoing patent but relies upon threadlike material to distribute the medicine. U.S. Pat. No. 1,575,123, to Martocci-Pisculli, requires an outer shell of a soluble material that dissolves after insertion, thereby exposing expansible material. No outer shield remains about this material. Medication may be applied at the top of the shell for application to the cervix, and medication may be applied to the absorbent explansible material within the shell. However, it is not seen how this device could retain a liquid medicament layer against the vaginal walls. Moreover, in that the expansible material is moisture absorbent, it appears that the material would work to absorb or withdraw the medicament from the vaginal walls. Rannells U.S. Pat. No. 1,355,846 describes a device having a tube running into it through which medicines may be introduced. For obvious reasons, this device requires the service of a physician. U.S. Pat. No. 4,077,409 to Murray is essentially a catamenial-type device for controlling menstrual flow. It is cited in this group only because it notes that disinfectants and medicaments can be added to the material filling the capsule. The device is obviously different from the present invention as will appear. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Briefly, therefore, the present invention is directed to a novel IVD usable as means for introducing medicaments into the vagina of a human female and holding such medicaments in contact with the vaginal mucosa. Basically the device can be used for maintaining in the vagina medicaments and the like that otherwise might leak out. At the same time it provides a tampon as a means for the absorption of excess liquids. The device uses a familiar telescopic insertion mechanism for its being inserted into the vagina. It also includes a shield of relatively thin, flexible, membrane-like material such as a plastic that surrounds a pressure element, receives medicaments, holds the medicaments against the vagina walls and prevents their inadvertent contact with the pressure element or tampon material prematurely. To this end there is a tube that discharges outside of the shield at the top of the IVD or pressure element. This tube may be connected to an injection capsule or syringe that contains the medicament and it normally has a plug at the end that prevents it from discharging its material until desired. The pressure element is a material that can expand and cause the pressure element to fill and expand the vagina and to apply gentle pressure to the walls thereof. Further, there is an absorbent leaf tampon at the lower end of the pressure element. This is expansible against the walls of the vagina and acts as a means to prevent the escape of the medicaments or other liquids that are present. The device does not require the woman to lie down to apply medicaments and it does not involve the necessity of keeping clean and pure syringes and the like. The foregoing arrangement enables the product to adapt itself to the shape of the vagina of a woman. The vagina is varying in shapes from the entrance to the cervix and it also varies in size. The present invention adapts to these variations. Moreover, the device expands the vagina, unfolding the walls thereof, permitting access for the medicament to sections of the walls that are otherwise concealed. In addition, the gentle pressure applied to the vaginal walls by the device provides beneficial physical action on the tissues, thereby to improve tonality and other aspects of the tissues and organs in question.",

    "abstract": "An increasingly common procedure for the treatment of atherosclerosis is the method known as Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty, or &#34;PTCA.&#34; This procedure employs a long, flexible catheter having a tubular sheath with an internal fluid passage, and a radially expandible and contractible balloon coaxially surrounding the peripheral surface of the distal end of the catheter, in communication with the fluid passage. The catheter is inserted, via a guidewire, into a blood vessel (e.g., a coronary artery) having a localized stenosis, so that the balloon is located at the site of the stenosis. The balloon is inflated, with fluid injected into the passage, to dilate the vessel and relieve the stenosis. Using this method, the location of the stenosis must first be determined by angiography, which yields only a shadowy, unclear image of the stenosis in one plane. Thus, it is difficult to determine the precise geometry and condition of the stenosis, and the proper positioning of the balloon is not readily confirmed. Consequently, the effectiveness of PTCA treatment is less than optimal, with a significant percentage of treated patients suffering a recurrence of the stenosis. To overcome this problem, a class of instruments known as fiberscopes has been developed. A state-of-the-art fiberscope is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,576,145 to Tsuno, et al. The Tsuno, et al. device comprises an elongate flexible tube, the interior of which is divided by a plurality of longitudinally extending partitions into four longitudinal passages or lumens. A first lumen carries a plurality of optical fibers for transmitting illuminating light from an external source. A second lumen carries a light receiving or imaging, optical fiber. A third lumen is an inflation passage for an inflatable elastomeric balloon coaxially surrounding the tube near its distal end. The fourth lumen is for carrying a flushing liquid (such as saline solution) to an outlet at the distal tip of the tube. A fiberscope of the type described in the Tsuno, et al. patent is used by inserting the distal end into a blood vessel, the interior of which is to be examined for, e.g., a stenosis. The balloon is then inflated with a fluid supplied by an injection device connected to the proximal end of the tube. The inflated balloon substantially reduces the flow rate of blood through the vessel, thereby allowing a relatively small volume of flushing liquid, ejected from the distal tip of the tube, to clear blood away from the area around the tube&#39;s tip. Light from the optical transmission fibers can then be used to illuminate this area, with the image of the area being conveyed to an observer by means of the imaging optical fiber. While the above-described fiberscope provides a clear, detailed view of the area to be observed, the fiberscope must still be removed before most types of therapeutic procedures can be performed. It is possible, of course, to perform laser angioplasty by transmitting laser light through a suitable fiber optic assembly installed in one of the tube&#39;s lumens. Indeed, a number of prior art devices have contemplated this expedient, as exemplified in the following U.S. Pat. Nos.: 4,418,688 to Loeb; 4,445,892 to Hussein, et al.; and 4,448,188 to Loeb. The prior art fiberscopes still suffer from a number of shortcomings. First, to achieve good visual resolution, relatively expensive optical components must be used, thereby making the overall unit too expensive to be disposable. This necessitates costly cleaning and sterilization for reuse. Second, the prior art devices are of a size (diameter) that makes them suitable for use only in larger blood vessels. Third, as previously mentioned, the prior art devices, except in some types of laser angioplasty, must be removed from the patient before therapeutic treatment of the stenosis is undertaken. In an effort to overcome these disadvantages, there has been devised the concept of incorporating the features of a fiberscope into a balloon angioplasty catheter. This concept is disclosed in European Patent Application No. 85 304962.5, published Apr. 9, 1986 as Publication No. 0177124 in the name of Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. As described therein, this catheter comprises a flexible, tube-like sheath with an expandible angioplasty balloon coaxially surrounding its distal end. The sheath contains a longitudinally-extending light guide for conducting light to the distal end of the catheter, and an imaging optical fiber bundle with suitable imaging lenses at its distal end for transmitting an image from the distal end of the catheter to the proximal end. The interior of the sheath is also provided with an inflation passage for transmitting fluid to inflate the balloon and a flushing liquid passage for conducting a flushing liquid through the catheter and out of an orifice in its distal end. The device described in the above-identified European Patent Application is disclosed as capable of functioning concurrently as an endoscope to locate and observe a stenosis and an angioplasty device for relieving the stenosis. Thus, this device overcomes some of the above-mentioned limitations of prior art fiberscopes, in that observation and treatment can be performed with one instrument inserted a single time. Nevertheless, certain drawbacks still exist. Specifically, the above-described device still uses standard optical components (i.e., fiber optics and lenses) thereby necessitating high costs and the requirement of cleaning and sterilization for reuse. Also, although some size reduction is achievable with this design, further size reduction is still desirable. Thus, there has been established a need for a combined fiberscope/angioplasty catheter that combines good optical qualities with sufficiently low cost so as to be disposable. Further, such a device should be capable of being made in sufficiently small diameters to be usable in smaller blood vessels than has heretofore been possible. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Broadly, the present invention is an improved balloon-type PTCA catheter with an integral fiber optic assembly, wherein the improvement comprises the use of novel optical components that yield enhanced visual resolution at a substantially lower cost than was previously available in the prior art. More specifically, a balloon-type PTCA catheter, in accordance with the present invention, includes an elongate, flexible, tubular sheath, internally partitioned into three longitudinal lumens. The first lumen contains the imaging and illuminating fiber optics that include the improvement to be described below. The second lumen is an inflation passage for conducting an inflation fluid to the angioplasty balloon that coaxially surrounds the sheath near the distal end of the catheter. The third lumen, larger in cross-sectional area than the other two, serves principally as a conduit for a guidewire or other ancillary devices, and also as a channel for the passage of optically transparent liquids for flushing blood away from the field of view at the distal tip of the catheter. This third lumen can also be used for blood pressure monitoring and for the injection of dyes, drugs, etc. The novel aspects of the fiber optic assembly are mainly directed to the construction of the imaging optics. Specifically, the imaging optics include an imaging fiber bundle comprising a very large number (e.g., approximately 2000 to 3000) of individual image fibers, or pixels, made of fused silica glass doped with germanium dioxide to increase the index of refraction. The pixels are relatively small, on the order of three to four microns in diameter. They are bound together by a fluorine-doped glass with a much lower index of refraction than the pixels, thereby increasing the numerical aperture of the fiber, as will be discussed below in the Detailed Description of the Invention. The imaging fiber bundle is coated with an opaque coating, e.g., an ultraviolet-cured acrylate epoxy, for structural strength and for shielding the pixels from ambient light. With the construction described above, the imaging fiber bundle provides higher image contrast, better resolution, and greater light sensitivity than the imaging fiber optics used in prior art fiberscopes. Moreover, the resulting fiber bundle is highly flexible, and its diameter is very small relative to fiber optic bundles with comparable light-gathering abilities. Finally, the fibers of the present invention&#39;s imaging fiber bundle are substantially lower in cost than those used in prior art angioscopes. Another novel aspect of the imaging optics that provides a substantial improvement over the prior art is the imaging lens that is attached to the distal end of the imaging fiber bundle. This imaging lens is a gradient index objective lens, comprising a cylinder of optical quality glass having a refractive index that decreases, gradually and continuously, in the radially outward direction. Such gradient index lenses are considerably less expensive than the conventional geometric lenses used in prior art angioscopes. The lens is attached to the distal end of the imaging fiber bundle by an optically transparent epoxy adhesive that has very high optical transmission throughout the visible spectrum, while also being biocompatible. A further novel aspect of the present invention is that the illuminating optical fibers are made of an optical-grade plastic (e.g., polymethylmethacrylate). Such plastics offer several advantages over the glass fibers used in prior art angioscopes: (1) more efficient light gathering characteristics; (2) greater flexibility; (3) ease of manufacture; and (4) lower cost. As will be better appreciated from the detailed description that follows, the present invention constitutes a versatile, cost-effective PTCA catheter that is capable both of clear visualization of the interior of a blood vessel (or other bodily passage or cavity) and of effective therapeutic treatment of the visualized condition by any number of means, including balloon and laser angioplasty. Furthermore, as compared to prior art devices of this class, the present invention offers enhanced optical capabilities, while allowing sufficiently low cost of manufacture to provide a disposable device.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to a display label attachment means of the type mentioned in the preamble of the independent claims. DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART In many shops an article displaying bracket or holder unit known as a peghook display is provided for displaying unit packages. GB-A 2275807 shows a peghook display in which a backboard with a pattern of holes supports an array of projecting peghooks. Each of the peghooks projects substantially horizontally and has two vertically spaced arms. At the free end of the upper arm a label with an electronic display is provided while the lower arm acts as a goods bearing member on which the goods to be displayed may be hung. The label is hinged about a horizontal axis at the end of the upper arm and normally hangs downwards. It can however be pivoted about the horizontal axis and manually held out in a horizontal orientation to enable goods to be placed onto, and removed from, the lower arm. A problem with such the label attaching means for peghook displays with pivotable labels is that as the label hangs vertically it may be difficult to read if it is too low or too high. This is particularly true if the label is a LCD electronic display which typically have only a narrow viewing angle i.e. it is only possible to read the display if the person looking at the display is looking nearly perpendicularly at the display. Another problem with such label attaching means can be that it requires the use of two hands to add goods to the goods bearing member—one hand to hold the label attaching means up out of the way of the goods bearing member and the other hand to feed goods onto the goods bearing member. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object with the present invention is to overcome the problems of prior art label attaching means. According to the invention this is achieved by a label attachment means having al least one bracing means which co-operates with the label supporting means such as a peghook arm. The bracing means has at least one bracing surface which can be selectively, individually brought into contact with the label holder. Each bracing surface causes the label holder to take up a predetermined angle with respect to the label supporting means. The bracing arm or label holder is preferably provided with retaining means for retaining the bracing surface in the desired position. This allows the angle to the vertical of the label to be adjusted and maintained so that it is at an optimum angle for reading.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to 2-cyclopenten-1-one and its derivatives as inhibitors of the transcription factor Nuclear Factor-kappaB (NF-kB). In particular the invention relates to 2-cyclopenten-1-one and its derivatives comprising the cyclopentenone nucleus as inhibitors of the NF-kB factor with anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, immuno-suppressive, cytoprotective and antiviral activity. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION NF-kB (Nuclear Factor-κB) is an eucariotic transcription factor of the rel family, which is normally located in the cytoplasm in an inactive complex, whose predominant form is a heterodimer composed of p50 and p65 subunits, bound to inhibitory proteins of the IkB family, usually IkB-alpha (D. Thanos and T. Maniatis, and Cell 80:529-532, 1995). NF-kB is activated in response to different stimuli, among which phorbol esters, inflammatory cytokines, UV radiation, bacterial and viral infections. Stimulation triggers the release of NF-kB from IkB in consequence of the phosphorylation and the following degradation of the IkB-alpha protein (P. A. Baeuerle and T. Henkel, Annu. Rev. Immunol. 12: 141-179, 1994). Once it is activated, NF-kB translocates to the nucleus where it binds to DNA at specific kb-sites and induces the transcription of a variety of genes encoding proteins involved in controlling the immune and inflammatory responses, among which a variety of interleukins, the tumor necrosis factor alpha, the NO synthase and the cyclo-oxigenase 2 (S. Grimm and P. A. Baeuerle, Biochem. J. 290: 297-308, 1993). Accordingly, NF-kB is considered an early mediator of the immune and inflammatory responses and it is involved in the control of cell proliferation and in the pathogenesis of various human diseases, among which rheumatoid arthritis (H. Beker et al., Clin. Exp. Immunol. 99: 325, 1995), ischemia (A. Salminen et al. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 212: 939, 1995), arteriosclerosis (A. S. Baldwin. Annals Rev. Immunol. 14: 649, 1996), as well as in the pathogenesis of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), due to the enhanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) transcription in the presence of activated NF-kB. The increase of HIV-1 virus RNAs transcription by NF-kB is caused by the presence of kb-sites in the (LTR) (Long Terminal Repeats) sequences of the virus genome (M. J. Lenardo and D. Baltimore, Cell 58: 227-229, 1989). It is also known that prostaglandins (PGs) are a class of naturally occurring cyclic 20-carbon fatty acids that are synthetized by various types of eukaryotic cells in response to external stimuli and play an important role in a variety of physiological responses. Since their discovery, PGs were shown to act as microenvironmental hormones and intracellular signal mediators and to control a large number of physiological and pathological processes, including cell proliferation and differentiation, the immune response, inflammation, cytoprotection and the febrile response. In particular, type A and J PGs, which possess a cyclopentenonic structure, are strong inhibitors of virus replication (“Stress Proteins: Induction and Function” Schlesinger M J, Garaci E., Santoro M. G. ed.s, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg-Berlin, 2744, 1990). Particularly, it has been recently demonstrated that cyclopentenonic prostaglandins inhibit HIV-1 virus replication, by blocking the viral RNAs transcription (C. Rozera et al. J. Clin. Invest. 97: 1795, 1996). It is also known that the Heat Shock Proteins (ESPs), also called stress proteins (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86, 8407-8411, 1989), are a family of polypeptides synthetized by eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells in response to heat shock or other kinds of environmental stresses. The HSPs are encoded by a cellular subgroup of genes, identified as stress genes. The authors have shown that the cyclopentenone prostaglandin PGA inhibits the activation of NF-kB in human cells by inhibiting the phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitory IkB-alpha protein (A. Rossi, G. Elia and M. G. Santoro, Cold Spring Harbour, N.Y. 1-5 May, 1996, Abstract p. 255). The authors have also recently shown that inhibition of NF-kB activation is one of the molecular mechanisms used by cyclopentenonic prostaglandins to cause a selective and reversible block of HIV-1 virus RNAs transcription. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION It has now been found that 2-cyclopenten-1-one, the structure constituting the center nucleus of PGA, possesses an activity which is analogous to PGA, that is, it is able to inhibit NF-kB activation, even though it does not contain the corresponding acid function and aliphatic lateral chains. Therefore it is found that the lateral chains, which are present in the PGA with their substituents and double bonds, in particular the acid function, which implies the fatty acid nature of prostaglandins, can be eliminated without substantially modifying the herein above described specific activity. It is also found that the alpha,β-unsatured carbonyl group in the cyclopentenone ring is the key structure necessary for NF-kB inhibition. Furthermore it has been found that the inhibition of NF-kB by the cyclopentenone group is related to the ability to activate the HSF transcription factor (Heat Shock Transcription Factor), which is responsible for the synthesis of HSPs (Heat Shock Proteins). In view of the fact that NF-kB inhibition is associated with HSF activation, it is evident that molecules containing the cyclopentenone nucleus, which is active in inhibiting NF-kB, will be inducers of the HSF factor and therefore they will be inducers of heat shock proteins. It is therefore an object of the present invention the 2-cyclopenten-1-one, and its substituted derivatives comprising the cyclopentenone nucleus, as inhibitors of NF-kB, the substituents being selected among the ones which do not affect the NF-kB inhibitory activity. Another object of the present invention is the 2-cyclopenten-1-one and its pharmacologically acceptable derivatives as inhibitors of NF-kB. Another object of the invention is the 2-cyclopenten-1-one and its derivatives as inhibitors of NF-kB with anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, immuno-suppressive, cytoprotective and antiviral activity. A further object of the invention are pharmaceutical compositions comprising 2-cyclopenten-1-one and/or its pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives to make medicaments with anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, immuno-suppressive, cytoprotective antiviral activity. In particular with antiviral activity against the HIV-1 virus and viruses whose transcription is controlled by NF-kB, including herpesviruses.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates to fishing lures. More particularly, it relates to self-contained light emitting fishing lures for enhanced fish attracting qualities. 2. Description of the Prior Art Six prior art patents have been located which disclose light emitting fishing lures. The first is U.S. Pat. No. 4,227,331 issued Oct. 14, 1980 to Ursrey, et al. for a Fish Lure. That patent describes a lure which uses one or more light emitting diodes, preferably of a type which emits green light, and includes a suitable power source disposed interally of the lure body for energizing the diode. The light emitting diodes are attached to and protrude outwardly from the lure body so as to provide wide angle disbursion of light. When the lure is submerged in water, an electrical circuit is established to activate the light emitting source. Another is U.S. Pat. No. 4,250,650, issued Feb. 17, 1981, to Raoul G. Fima for an Intermittently Illuminated Fishing Lure. That patent discloses a fishing lure containing one or more light sources and which includes an internal guide way along which a battery rolls back and forth in response to an occillatory movement of the lure. A series of stationary electrical contacts are positioned along the guide way to successively engage the moving battery to intermittently complete a circuit and energize the light sources. The light sources are mounted interally for protection of the lure body and the light is transmitted to exterior locations by optical conductors. A further one is U.S. Pat. No. 3,621,600 issued Nov. 23, 1971 to M. Dworski for a Fish Lure, and it discloses a lure which has a separate translucent head and body members which are assembled to the head either in the form of a series of disks or like halves assembled around an incandescent lamp and dry cell which weight the lure. Yet another is U.S. Pat. No. 3,608,228 issued Sept. 28, 1971, to R. W. Borreson, et al. for a Fishing Lure. That patent discloses a lure of the plug type comprised of hollow detachable sections which are provided with apparatus for illuminating the lure. Various weights may be positioned within the lure cavities, and the head section is formed of translucent material to provide a prismatic effect for the illumination means to form eye simulating areas on each side of the head section of the lure. Still further is U.S. Pat. No. 3,040,462 issued June 26, 1962, to F. C. Guida for a Luminescent Fishing Lure. That patent discloses a lure which has a pair of chambers, one of which contains a power source and the other of which contains a light emitting bulb which also projects into a third water filled chamber and illuminates the lure by transmitting light through the translucent body of the lure. Still another is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,121,114 issued June 21, 1938, to G. Beck for a Fish Lure. That device discloses a fish lure also having a translucent body within which a light emitting source is disposed for illuminating the lure. The present invention provides a simplified device which makes use of improved electronics for longer life and ease of construction to reduce cost as compared with the referenced prior art devices. A significant difference between the present invention and the known prior art is that in most cases the prior art devices must be disassembled to remove the battery in order to shut off the light emitter. They do not include a positive switch means for actuating the light sources from a position external to the lure or without immersing the lure in water. Because of the very hostile environment the lures are subjected to, it is very desirable to be able to check batteries and interal circuitry of an illuminable lure quickly. Fishermen also like to be able to change lures rapidly, and in order to accomplish this with the least loss of time, an external switch means is required to turn off the replaced lure and turn on the new one. Disassembly and assembly of lures, with their differing battery requirements, sizes, and parts to shut off and turn on a lure makes those procedures unsatisfactory in the most desired fishing environment. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is a light emitting fishing lure which includes a body portion having a cavity formed therein for containing one or more batteries. An electrical contact for establishing an electrical connection with the battery is formed integral to the cavity. The cavity includes means for urging the battery toward the front end or head portion of the lure. At least one fish hook is secured to the body portion of the lure. A head portion is provided which is securable to the body portion. The front end of the body portion is adapted to mate with the head portion in sealing relation to prevent water from entering the cavity portion of the body. An electrical contact for the battery of opposite polarity from the body portion contact is provided in the head to complete the electrical circuit for the lure. A switch means operable from a position external to the head and body portions is formed integral to the lure for activating the battery. At least one light emitting diode projects from the lure and is electrically connected to the battery and the switch means. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION It is therefore an important object of the present invention to provide a simplified illuminated lure. It is another object of the present invention to provide an illuminated lure using light emitting diodes as simulated eyes or other features for the lure which flash on and off for increased fish attraction. And it is a further object of the present invention to provide an illuminated fishing lure which has an external switch to allow the light emitter to be turned on and off without assembly or disassembly of the lure and while it is held in the fisherman&#39;s hands.",

    "abstract": "The present invention relates generally to clamping devices, and in particular to an articulated coupling clamp having multiple axes of rotation. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION During orthopedic surgery, various portions of a patient&#39;s body are elevated above an operating table. To accommodate and sustain the elevated position, patient support devices are routinely used, including slings, straps and angular support equipment. Conventional support equipment is difficult to adjust or reposition. Each adjustment requires a disconnection and recoupling of the accompanying support apparatus. During surgery, this repositioning procedure is not only cumbersome, but is also time consuming. Ideally, such patient support equipment should be released and secured by a single actuator. DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART Conventional clamps having two or more axes of rotational adjustment are also provided with separate release/lock actuators for controlling the orientation of a single support device. Operation of the separate actuator must be carefully coordinated to reposition the elevated body member during operation. Accordingly, there is a need for a single release, multiple axis coupling patient support which can be quickly, easily and securely adjustable upward, downward or at various angles about a vertical support shaft. OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION The principal object of the present invention is to provide an improved coupling device having multiple positioning movements to accommodate a wide range of angles about a vertical support shaft. A related object of the invention is to provide an improved coupling device and support assembly which is operative below and in an offset position relative to the patient&#39;s supported body member. Another object of the invention is to provide a multiple axis coupling device which can be locked into a rigid position or released by a single release actuator. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention provides a coupling assembly allowing for movement and positional control of various portions of a patient&#39;s body. Typically, an ankle and lower leg are supported and movable by a support rod having either two or three axes of rotation about a vertical support shaft. In a double axis configuration, the single rod is horizontally rotatable about the vertical support shaft axis, while also vertically rotatable about a piston through which the vertical support shaft is extended. Double axis rotational movement is permitted by axial movement of a single cylindrical piston into the coupling device&#39;s housing chamber. Such piston movement is provided in response to a counterclockwise rotation of a single actuator shaft. Alternatively, movement can be &#34;frozen&#34; or prohibited by a clockwise rotation of the actuator shaft and subsequent withdrawal of the cylindrical piston from the coupling device&#39;s housing chamber. By engaging various portions of the coupling assembly, the coupling device is locked in a rigid position relative to the vertical support shaft. In a triple axis configuration, not only is the support rod both vertically and horizontally rotatable (double axis), but the support rod is also capable of being rotated about its own axis. Movement about the three rotational axes is permitted by a counterclockwise rotation of a single actuator shaft and reciprocating withdrawal of a double piston assembly from the coupling device&#39;s housing chamber. By using two pistons instead of one, the third axis of rotation is permitted. However, when the single actuator shaft is tensioned in a clockwise manner, both pistons are simultaneously engaged with various portions of the coupling assembly and the entire device is locked in a rigid position relative to the vertical support shaft. The coupling assembly, whether it be double or triple axis of movement, is attached below and in offset relation to the patient&#39;s supported body member. This type of supporting arrangement provides the physician with an open working area above the patient&#39;s supported member during the performance of a surgical procedure. Also, whether the physician requires either the two or the three degrees of coupling freedom, the locking and release action of the coupling assembly is easily and quickly obtained by a single rotational movement of a threaded actuator shaft.",

    "abstract": "The present invention addresses these requirements by providing in a modular tibial prosthesis including a base plate and an articular component an interlocking two-segment dovetail mechanism. The plate has an upwardly extending rail around its periphery which merges with an upwardly extending two-segment dovetail. This continuous rail strengthens the base plate by eliminating notches along the plate periphery. This configuration is accommodated by the two-segment configuration which allows a continuous rail while maintaining dovetail engagement posteriorly. The two-segment dovetail also minimizes the dimensions of the anterior dovetail segment to reduce the requisite dovetail groove in the articular component thereby yielding a stronger articular component. The dovetail segments incorporate compound angles which engage a two-segment, compound angle, dovetail groove in the underside of the articular component to wedge the articular component against the proximal surface and anterior rail of the tibial plate. This wedging action resists sliding and separation between the tibial components. In a preferred embodiment, the dovetail mechanism cooperates with a posterior tongue and groove arrangement to further resist separation of the tibial components. The two-segment dovetail also allows the alternative use of an articular component having a reinforced spine on the same base plate design. A rigid reinforcing post extends upwardly into the spine to strengthen the spine and resist forces placed on the spine that would otherwise tend to separate the articular component and the base plate. The reinforcing post has a base portion that can be recessed into the articular component. The base portion contains a slot which avoids engagement between the rigid base portion and the anterior dovetail segment on the plate. However, the posterior dovetail segments of the articular surface and the plate still engage one another. The base portion also contains a through hole coaxial with a hole through the articular component and a hole in the base plate to accommodate a bolt for securely joining the components.

The present invention provides for perorally inserting a removable sutureless anti-reflux valve prosthesis down the lumen of the esophagus, to the gastroesophageal junction, where it is fixed in place. The advantage of this system is that peroral insertion of such a valve eliminates the need for either open formal laparotomy, thoracotomy or a laparoscopic approach using multiple access ports. In the event it is later desired to remove or replace the prosthesis, the valve can be removed using a peroral extraction tool, again generally without the need for laparotomy, thoracotomy, laparoscopy, or any other surgically invasive technique. In one aspect, the present invention provides an anti-reflux valve prosthesis. The prosthesis has an annular fixation element for fixing the prosthesis in an esophagus, and a one-way valve depending from the annular fixation element for allowing orthograde passage therethrough and inhibiting retrograde passage of gastric contents.

The method comprises: (a) threadably engaging the nipple in the annular body; (b) bending the spikes inwardly and positioning the shield in the first position over the spikes; (c) perorally inserting the valve prosthesis into the esophagus near the gastroesophageal junction; (d) while holding the valve prosthesis in place, moving the shield into the second position to release the spikes to return to the memory position; (e) optionally moving the shield into the third position to facilitate return of the spikes into the memory position to facilitate engagement of the spikes in a wall of the esophagus; (f) rotating the inner tube with respect to the annular body to uncouple the nipple; and (g) withdrawing the tool from the esophagus. A further aspect of the invention is a tool for extracting the anti-reflux valve prosthesis of the alternate embodiment wherein the annular body is internally threaded and the spikes are attached to a proximal end of the annular body. The tool includes inner and outer concentric tubes, a nipple secured to a distal end of the inner tube for threadably coupled the annular body, and a handle secured adjacent to a proximal end of the inner tube for manipulation thereof. The inner tube and the outer tube are in threaded interengagement for advancement of the outer tube by rotating the outer tube with respect to the inner tube. A crown is secured to a distal end of the outer tube and has a plurality of tangentially projecting shoes disposed on a distal end of respective longitudinal arms spaced along a circumference of the crown in correspondence with the spikes for bending the fixation spikes inwardly. An overtube has a shield of enlarged diameter at a distal end. The overtube is slidable over the outer tube to receive the plurality of inwardly bent spikes within the shield to inhibit laceration of the esophagus during movement of the prosthesis. A still further aspect of the invention is a method of using the tool just described for extracting the anti-reflux valve prosthesis. The method includes: (a) perorally inserting the tool into the esophagus and threadably engaging the nipple in the annular body of the prosthesis; (b) while holding the inner tube in place, rotating the outer tube with respect to the inner tube to advance the crown with respect to the nipple, engage the spikes with the shoes and bend the fixation spikes radially inwardly; (c) advancing the overtube to position the shield over the inwardly bent spikes; and (d) withdrawing the tool and the prosthesis from the esophagus.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to the application of cardiac pacing technologies to heart transplants. Heart transplantation is a therapeutic option in the management of end stage heart failure. Two methods of surgical transplantation are typically done; orthotopic or heterotopic. In the orthotopic technique, the donor heart is attached to a partial remnant of the recipient&#39;s native right and left atria, essentially replacing the recipient heart chambers. In the heterotopic technique, the donor heart is implanted along side and is attached to the recipient heart such that it augments the recipient&#39;s cardiac output. FIG. 1a shows what the completed surgical heterotopic transplant looks like, and FIG. 1b illustrates the orthotopic surgery. Known problems with heterotopic transplant include the progressive deterioration observed in the recipient left ventricular function and reduced exercise capacity due to the competitive contraction of the two hearts; with the donor left ventricle generating a much higher afterload for the failing recipient left ventricle. Additionally (in both described transplant techniques), the donor heart is denervated, therefore its resting rate (typically near 90 bpm) exceeds that of the recipient sinus rate. Further, the donor heart rate response to exercise is attenuated, if present at all. Finally, the recipient atrium often develops arrhythmias. Similar problems may develop with xenotransplants, such as with the use of baboon hearts or genetically altered porcine hearts transplanted into humans. Because of these and other potential problems, an implantable electrical stimulus generator could be useful if designed to meet the needs of this situation. A modified pacemaker that can pace at multiple sites and preferably also sense at multiple sites can be used to alleviate the problems described in transplantation described above. Cardiac electrical stimulation has a long history with implantable cardiac stimulators going back perhaps 40 years. Only recently however have the implanted devices found use for multiple lead configurations. Examples include patents assigned to ELA Medical (Limousin et al.) U.S. Pat. No. 5,514,161 and 5,584,867, for example, and there are also patents directed to defibrillators, see for example U.S. Pat. No. 5,282,837 issued to Adams et al. which show leads in the coronary sinus that may be useful in left atrial or left ventricular stimulation. A typical pacemaker system which could form the basis for most of the requirements for multisite pacing is described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,549,654 issued to Powell, although many other suitable pacing or pacing and/defibrillation implantable device pulse generator (IPG) platforms may be used. A number of designs for Cardiac Assistance devices may also be used. Such devices are described in, for example U.S. Pat. No. 4,411,268 to Cox, and are used in stimulating muscle tissue which has been (or will be) surgically wrapped around the heart while also providing the possibility of direct cardiac pacing. It is also known for example, that optimizing the timing of ventricular pulses, in relation to paced or serial atrial events can assist in Hypertropic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM) Therapy. This is demonstrated in the pending PCT patent publication No. WO96/25977, published in August 1996, for example. Also, as described in the Limousin and Limousin et al. patents cited above, bi-atrial pacing can be advantageous. It is currently recognized in theory that differing pathways for depolarization waves can greatly affect cardiac performance (see Fritz Prinzen, Ph.D. et al. American Heart Journal, 1995:130:1045-1053, for example). Accordingly, there is a need to develop a multisite capable fully configurable pacemaker and/or pacemaker/defibrillator. Of course, there have been numerous devices which have been taught or developed in response to this need, including those described in patents on devices to control ventricular activation sequence (Cohen, U.S. Pat. No. 5,267,289 and 5,174,536 and Goldreyer U.S. Pat. No. 4,365,639), devices for dealing with fibrillation and other arrhythmias (Combs U.S. Pat. No. 5,562,708; Hill U.S. Pat. No. 5,507,784 and 5,403,356; Zipes U.S. Pat. No. 5,366,486; Duffin U.S. Pat. No. 5,243,978; 5,209,229; Adams U.S. Pat. No. 5,158,079; Ideker U.S. Pat. No. 5,107,834; Tacker Jr U.S. Pat. No. 4,708,145 and 4,548,203; and Prystowsky U.S. Pat. No. 4,554,922), devices capable of sensing through multiple, sometimes switchable electrodes (King U.S. Pat. No. 4,630,611 and 4,754,753; Funke U.S. Pat. No. 3,937,226; and Rockland U.S. Pat. No. 4,088,140; Kahn U.S. Pat. No. 4,354,497;; Mower(in which multiple sense electrode sites assist in treating hemodynamic dysfunction) U.S. Pat. No. 4,928,688), devices for switching between stimulation electrodes generally, (for example, in upper airway muscle stimulation Kallok U.S. Pat. No. 5,281,219), in devices for switching between different out of the device sensors or electrodes (Schaldach U.S. Pat. No. 4,412,541); King U.S. Pat. No. 4,750,494; Peterson U.S. Pat. No. 5,447,519; and Yang U.S. Pat. No. 5,476,503), in a device for applying differing parts of a pulse segment to different parts of a defibrillation electrode (in Dahl U.S. Pat. No. 4,969,463), and in devices which use the same electrodes for demand pacing and antitachy breakup pulses (Kolenik U.S. Pat. No. 4,181,133). However none of the aforementioned devices can perform the function herein described and in various aspects they are lacking in the flexibility and ease of configuration or simplicity of circuitry as the device described herein. Several doctors have attempted to solve these problems with conventional pacemakers. In AN EXAMPLE OF HOW TO PACE A PATIENT WITH A HEART TRANSPLANTATION, by Osterholzer et al., Journal of Heart Transplant 1988;7:23-5, the authors describe the use of a Pacesetter AFP/283, Pacesetter Systems Inc., pacemaker with a two lead system configured with a lead in the recipient atrium (orthotopic transplant) used to sense the native sinus rate and after the shortest programmable delay, pace the donor atrium, which was counted on to pace the donor ventricle. (An additional lead was implanted into a donor ventricle so that if &#34;atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response in the donor heart requires ventricular stimulation, a simple pulse generator exchange will solve the problem.&#34;) Another study published by McClurken, et al., RECIPIENT-DONOR ATRIAL SYNCHRONIZATION BENEFITS ACUTE HEMODYNAMICS AFTER ORTHOTOPIC HEART TRANSPLANTATION in the Journal of Heart Lung Transplant, 1996; 15:368-70 also described the benefits of timing the donor atrium to follow the recipient sinus rate. The McCracken article limits it study to acute pacing benefits with temporary heart wires. Kacet, et al., in their article BIPOLAR ATRIAL TRIGGERED PACING TO RESTORE NORMAL CHRONOTROPIC RESPONSIVE IN AN ORTHOTOPIC CARDIAC TRANSPLANT PATIENT, describe native sinus rhythm following set up for orthotopic transplants wherein a bipolar lead splitter is used to provide a way to bring one unipolar lead each to the native and donor atria, one to sense in the native atria and the other to pace in the donor heart. It cannot, of course sense in the donor atrium at all nor can it sense in the native atrium while the donor atrium is being paced. Kacet use this fact to enforce the employ of a long refractory period, which happens to miss some native atrial arrhythmia. All the foregoing suggests the need for an advanced pacemaker designed to assist in maintaining hemodynamic and natural sinus rate pacing for transplant patients. It would be most beneficial if the pacemaker could be used in both ortho- and heterotopic transplants. Further, since the advent of transplant monitoring by implantable devices as described for example in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,402,794 issued to Wahlstrand, et al.,5,197,480(Gepphardt), 5,139,028(Steinhaus et al.),5,330,513(Nichols et al), 5,331,966(Bennett et al.), and 4,905,707(Davies and Lekholm), an additional benefit can be had from specifically designing a pacemaker for transplants. That is, by sending indications of the state of the transplanted heart, the usual monthly biopsies to determine the state of the transplant tissue can be avoided or ameileorated. All of the references cited above are incorporated herein in their entireties by this reference so as to provide both background and disclosure for the invention described herein, said invention being described below with reference to the following Figures.",

    "abstract": "This invention relates to a device which provides a substantially continuous indication of the well-being of a patient. More particularly, the invention provides a detector of respiration (occurrence of breathing) which is highly accurate in use, yet which is relatively uncomplicated and inexpensive, and highly reliable and foolproof as compared to systems in the prior art. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION It has long been recognized in the anesthetic and other health-care related arts that monitoring respiration is a very reliable method of determining whether a patient is still alive, and moreover one which provides an instant indication of trouble, as compared with other life signs which take longer periods to depart from normal values. Such an indication is of great interest with patients undergoing surgery or in other life-threatening situations, and in connection with infants who, as is well-known, are subject to cessation of breathing (apnea) for no apparent cause. Therefore, it is desirable that means be provided for monitoring the continued breathing of an individual. One method of monitoring breathing which has been extensively employed in the prior art involves monitoring the difference in carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) content between an individual&#39;s inspired and expired gas streams. It is impossible to breathe without the CO 2  content of the expired gas stream varying from that of the inspired gas stream by at least about 2%. The prior art has recognized the above, yet applicant is aware of no system in the prior art which simply monitors the relative CO 2  content of the inspired stream and that of the expired stream and uses these to provide an indication of proper breathing or not, as the case may be. Instead, the prior art, as exemplified by the Hewlett-Packard Model 47210A capnometer, has tended toward systems of ever-increasing complexity and cost, providing in many cases values for the absolute amount of CO 2  present in the expired stream, which is unnecessary for a life monitor. Applicant has realized that all that needs to be detected is the relative difference in the CO 2  contents of the inspired and expired streams. It seems, therefore, that a need exists in the art for a simplified and improved respiration monitor of reduced complexity and cost, which operates by simply comparing the relative CO 2  contents of the inspired and expired gas streams, and to provide such is accordingly an object of the invention. The prior art has generally monitored the amount of CO 2  in a gas stream using infrared absorption measurement techniques. According to this technique, an infrared light source radiates through a cuvette having spaced parallel windows in which is enclosed a sample of the gas to be monitored. The radiation then falls on a suitable detector, typically a Golay cell such as Beckman Instruments&#39; Model LB-2, which is highly sensitive to acoustic noise, or a PbSe photodetector, which is very sensitive to low-frequency noise, a significant defect in the environment of this invention. It is an object of this invention to avoid use of these and other non-optimal detectors. According to one aspect of the invention, radiation is monitored by a thermopile (a combination of a number of individual thermistors, so as to be very sensitive to small temperature changes). Such thermopiles are useful even at low frequencies and in connection with D.C., unlike the other detector types mentioned. As in the prior art, the detector output is monitored. As infrared radiation of particular wavelengths is preferentially absorbed by carbon dioxide, the output of a detector sensitive to those wavelengths provides an inverse indication of the relative amount of CO 2  in the gas stream. By calibration using a sample of known concentration, or possibly by other methods, the detector can be made to yield quite accurate results; however, as mentioned above, the object of the invention is not so much to provide intrinsically accurate results concerning the actual amount of CO 2  present in a patient&#39;s exhaled gas stream, but merely to determine whether the patient is breathing. Therefore, according to the invention, calibration is ordinarily not performed, and the instrument is simply operated so as to detect variation in the CO 2  contents of the inspired and expired gas streams. Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide a respiration detector which operates by detecting the differences between the CO 2  concentration of inspired and expired gas streams, by providing a source of infrared radiation disposed in juxtaposition to a cuvette containing the gas stream to be measured, and by monitoring the output of a thermopile disposed opposite the infrared source on the other side of the cuvette, which does not require calibration for proper operation. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that measurement of the CO 2  content of a sample by radiation adsorption techniques is subject to error due to a number of factors. Though as mentioned above, the invention of the applicants is not so much concerned with measurement of the absolute value of the CO 2  in the patient&#39;s breath as between the relative difference in CO 2  content between the inspired and expired streams, it is nevertheless desirable that the instrument be operated in the optimal fashion and furthermore that it be enabled to operate under less than ideal conditions which may include, for example, clouding of the windows through which the infrared beam passes due to humidity, temperature drift and the like. Further, it is desirable that the instrument measure the relative difference in the CO 2  contents of the streams accurately regardless of their absolute value, i.e. whether the difference is between 0 and 3% CO 2  or between 6 and 9%. Finally, it is desirable that the absolute amount of radiation incident on the thermopile be substantially constant so that it can be well matched to the input value which provides the greatest dynamic range in the thermistor output signal. For all of the above reasons, it is desirable that means be provided to regulate the intensity of the radiation falling on the thermopile, so as to compensate the system for all the sources of possible error discussed above. In the preferred embodiment, this is achieved by provision of a feedback loop connecting the output of the thermopile with the power supply which is used to operate the source of infrared radiation. Use of feedback in a loop having a low pass filter therein ensures that variation in the inspired and expired gas stream will not cause the bulb output to vary, while ensuring that the mean output of the thermopile is maintained at a substantially constant level, thus compensating for all the sources of error just discussed. The selection of the infrared source has also been a source of some difficulty and expense in the prior art. The applicant has realized that, by using certain ordinary incandescent lamp bulbs, an adequate amount of infrared light of suitable wavelength is provided to enable suitable detection, thus further simplifying and reducing the cost of the apparatus of the invention. It is therefore an object of the invention to further simplify and reduce the cost of the apparatus of the invention by using an inexpensive source of infrared radiation. The prior art has also used costly sapphire windows for the windows of the cuvette. It is an object of the invention to avoid use of such materials. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the output of typical thermopiles is a relatively small voltage, usually on the order of millivolts. It will further be appreciated by those skilled in the art that in the typical hospital operating room environment of today, there are frequently a large number of electronic devices, some of which may not be properly shielded. Accordingly, it is desirable that the instrument be designed in such a way as to be less sensitive to electromagnetic noise than otherwise, and furthermore that the signal processing circuitry to which the thermopile is connected be enabled to differentiate between noise and signal insofar as reasonably possible, given the goals of simplicity and low cost, as discussed above, and such is accordingly an additional object of the invention. It is furthermore desirable that the gas stream be monitored as closely to the patient as possible, to obtain accurate results. Accordingly, the sensor of the respiration monitor of the invention should be lightweight, so as to be attachable directly to flexible tubing connected closely to the patient while still achieving the other objects of the invention discussed above, and such is accordingly an additional object of the invention.",

The structure is further provided with mounting means for removably attaching the back end of the horizontal shelf part to a support wall or the like such that when the shelf structure is mounted on the support wall the mounting means is invisible. When the shelf is attached, the brace portion is allowed to rest on the support wall at a point below where the mounting means is attached, thus providing support for the front end of the shelf part. The shelf structure of the present invention may be suitably made from a solid piece of wood, plastic, paper or the like which is bent or otherwise formed into the desired shape.

    "abstract": "The invention relates to endoscopic surgical instruments. More particularly, the invention relates to flexible instruments for the transoral invagination and fundoplication of the stomach to the esophagus. Gastroesophageal fundoplication is a procedure for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which gastric acids are regurgitated into the esophagus resulting in one or more of esophagitis, intractable vomiting, asthma, and aspiration pneumonia. The fundoplication procedure involves wrapping the fundus of the stomach around the lower end of the esophagus and fastening it in place. Traditionally, this procedure is accomplished via open surgery with the use of sutures to secure the plicated fundus of the stomach around the esophagus without penetrating (incising) the stomach. Although traditional fundoplication involves plicating the fundus and the esophagus, as used herein the term includes plicating the fundus to itself near the esophagus. U.S. Pat. No. 5,403,326 to Harrison et al. discloses a method of performing endoscopic fundoplication using surgical staples or two-part surgical fasteners. The procedure disclosed by Harrison et al. involves performing two percutaneous endoscopic gastrotomies (incisions through the skin into the stomach) and the installation of two ports through which a stapler, an endoscope, and an esophageal manipulator (invagination device) are inserted. Under view of the endoscope, the esophageal manipulator is used to pull the interior of the esophagus into the stomach. When the esophagus is in position, with the fundus of the stomach plicated, the stapler is moved into position around the lower end of the esophagus and the plicated fundus is stapled to the esophagus. The process is repeated at different axial and rotary positions until the desired fundoplication is achieved. While, the procedure disclosed by Harrison et al. is a vast improvement over open surgery, it is still relatively invasive requiring two incisions through the stomach. U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,116 to Bolanos et al. discloses a non-invasive treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease which utilizes a remotely operable invagination device and a remotely operable surgical stapler, both of which are inserted transorally through the esophagus. According to the methods disclosed by Bolanos et al., the invagination device is inserted first and is used to clamp the gastroesophageal junction. The device is then moved distally, pulling the clamped gastroesophageal junction into the stomach, thereby invaginating the junction and involuting the surrounding fundic wall. The stapler is then inserted transorally and delivered to the invaginated junction where it is used to staple the fundic wall. Bolanos et al. disclose several different invagination devices and several different staplers. Generally, each of the staplers disclosed by Bolanos et al. has an elongate body and a spring biased anvil which is rotatable approximately 15 degrees away from the body in order to locate the invaginated gastroesophageal junction between the body and the anvil. The body contains a staple cartridge holding a plurality of staples, and a staple firing knife. Each of the invagination devices disclosed by Bolanos et al. has a jaw member which is rotatable at least 45 degrees and in some cases more than 90 degrees to an open position for grasping the gastroesophageal junction. One of the chief disadvantages of the methods and apparatus disclosed by Bolanos et al. is that the stapler and the invagination device must both be present in the esophagus at the same time. With some of the embodiments disclosed, the presence of both instruments is significantly challenged by the size of the esophagus. In addition, the actuating mechanism of the device disclosed by Bolanos et al. is awkward. In particular, the stapler anvil is biased to the open position, and it is not clear whether or not the stapler anvil can be locked in a closed position without continuously holding down a lever. In addition, it appears that the staple firing trigger can be inadvertently operated before the anvil is in the closed position. This would result in inadvertent ejection of staples into the stomach or the esophagus of the patient. U.S. Pat. No. 6,086,600 to Kortenbach discloses an endoscopic surgical instrument including a flexible tube, a grasping and fastening end effector coupled to the distal end of the tube, and a manual actuator coupled to the proximal end of the tube. The manual actuator is coupled to the end effector by a plurality of flexible cables which extend through the tube. The tube contains a lumen for receiving a manipulable endoscope and the end effector includes a passage for the distal end of the endoscope. The end effector has a store for a plurality of male fastener parts, a store for a plurality of female fastener parts, a rotatable grasper, a rotatable fastener head for aligning a female fastener part and a male fastener part with tissues therebetween, and a firing member for pressing a male fastener part through tissues grasped by the grasper and into a female fastener part. According to a stated preferred embodiment, the overall diameters of the flexible tube and the end effector (when rotated to the open position) do not exceed approximately 20 mm so that the instrument may be delivered transorally to the fundus of the stomach. While transoral invagination and fundoplication apparatus and procedures have improved over the years, it is still difficult to deliver and manipulate the necessary apparatus transorally. The primary reason for the difficulty is that the overall diameter, or more accurately the cross sectional area, of the equipment is too large. Notwithstanding Kortenbach&#39;s reference to 20 mm, most of the equipment in use today is at least 24 mm in diameter. Moreover, even if the equipment could be reduced to 20 mm in diameter (314 mm 2  cross sectional area), it would still be difficult to manipulate. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that larger instruments are less pliable and that the invagination and fundoplication procedure requires that the instruments turn nearly 180 degrees. Moreover, it will be appreciated that large instruments obscure the endoscopic view of the surgical site. Still other issues which need to be addressed in this procedure include the need to suitably grasp the fundus before plication so that all layers of the fundus are plicated. Preferably, plication damages the fundus so that adhesion occurs during healing. 3. Co-owned Technology Previously incorporated application Ser. No. 09/730,911, filed Dec. 6, 2000, entitled “Methods and Apparatus for the Treatment of Gastric Ulcers”, discloses a surgical tool which is delivered to a surgical site over an endoscope rather than through the working lumen of an endoscope.

    "abstract": "The agricultural implement of the present invention includes a rigid framework mounted on wheels for attachment to a tractor, or the like, for movement through a field. A pair of disks are mounted upon the lower ends of a pair of parallel drive shafts with power drive means imparting rotation in opposite directions to the drive shafts and thereby to the disks. The drive shafts extend through respective, hollow tubes or sleeves to which a plurality of plates are rigidly attached. First and second pairs of plates are attached at vertically spaced positions on the sleeves, the plates of each pair being parallel with and spaced from one another on opposite sides of the sleeves. Also, each of the plates has an opening, horizontally aligned with the opening in the other plate of the pair, and a hollow, tubular member rigidly attached to the plates extends between the openings therein. The implement frame includes rigidly attached, vertical and horizontal members arranged at the front of the machine in a plane generally normal to the direction of movement of the machine, and attached to the rear frame portion for vertical movement with respect thereto. A pair of elongated guide members extend forwardly and outwardly at an acute angle to the longitudinal axis or centerline of the machine from rigid attachment to forward frame members on each side of the implement&#39;s centerline and evenly spaced therefrom. The guide members extend through the openings in each pair of spaced plates and the hollow members extending therebetween to support the latter for sliding movement along the guide members. Thus, the sleeves, and the drive shafts, disks and power drive means supported thereby, are movable together with the plates, along linear paths extending at an angle to the direction of movement of the machine. This permits selectively variable lateral spacing of the drive shafts and thereby the axes of rotation of the disks. Movement of the plates between inner and outer limits along the guide members changes the lateral spacing of the disk peripheries which may be overlapped by a desired distance, or spaced apart, depending upon the disk diameter and lateral distance between inner and outer limits of movement. The disk diameter may also be varied by replacing disks of one diameter with those of a different diameter to provide additional latitude in the amount of lateral adjustment of the disk peripheries.

    "abstract": "This invention provides methods for treating peri-menopausal syndrome, comprising administering to a human in need of treatment an effective amount of a compound of formula I ##STR3## wherein R 1  and R 3  are independently hydrogen, --CH 3 , ##STR4##  wherein Ar is optionally substituted phenyl; R 2  is selected from the group consisting of pyrrolidino and piperidino; and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates thereof. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The current invention concerns the discovery that a select group of 2-phenyl-3-aroylbenzothiophenes (benzothiophenes), those of formula I, are useful for treating peri-menopausal syndrome. The methods of treatment provided by this invention are practiced by administering to a human in need, a dose of a compound of formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof, that is effective to treat peri-menopausal syndrome. Treating is defined to include ameliorating one or more of the symptoms of peri-menopausal syndrome, and/or bringing a woman into a stable post-menopausal state in a reduced period of time. Generally, the compound is formulated with common excipients, diluents or carriers, and compressed into tablets, or formulated as elixirs or solutions for convenient oral administration, or administered by the intramuscular or intravenous routes. The compounds can be administered transdermally, and may be formulated as sustained release dosage forms and the like. The compounds used in the methods of the current invention can be made according to established procedures, such as those detailed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,133,814, 4,418,068, and 4,380,635 all of which are incorporated by reference herein. In general, the process starts with a benzo[b]thiophene having a 6-hydroxyl group and a 2(4-hydroxyphenyl) group. The starting compound is protected, alkylated, and deprotected to form the formula I compounds. Examples of the preparation of such compounds are provided in the U.S. patents discussed above. Substituted phenyl includes phenyl substituted once or twice with C 1  -C 6  alkyl, C 1  -C 4  alkoxy, hydroxy, nitro, chloro, fluoro, or tri(chloro or fluoro) methyl. The compounds used in the methods of this invention form pharmaceutically acceptable acid and base addition salts with a wide variety of organic and inorganic acids and bases and include the physiologically acceptable salts which are often used in pharmaceutical chemistry. Such salts are also part of this invention. Typical inorganic acids used to form such salts include hydrochloric, hydrobromic, hydroiodic, nitric, sulfuric, phosphoric, hypophosphoric and the like. Salts derived from organic acids, such as aliphatic mono and dicarboxylic acids, phenyl substituted alkanoic acids, hydroxyalkanoic and hydroxyalkandioic acids, aromatic acids, aliphatic and aromatic sulfonic acids, may also be used. Such pharmaceutically acceptable salts thus include acetate, phenylacetate, trifluoroacetate, acrylate, ascorbate, benzoate, chlorobenzoate, dinitrobenzoate, hydroxybenzoate, methoxybenzoate, methylbenzoate, o-acetoxybenzoate, naphthalene-2-benzoate, bromide, isobutyrate, phenylbutyrate, β-hydroxybutyrate, butyne-1,4-dioate, hexyne-1,4-dioate, caprate, caprylate, chloride, cinnamate, citrate formate, fumarate, glycollate, heptanoate, hippurate, lactate, malate, maleate, hydroxymaleate, malonate, mandelate, mesylate, nicotinate, isonicotinate, nitrate, oxalate, phthalate, teraphthalate, phosphate, monohydrogenphosphate, dihydrogenphosphate, metaphosphate, pyrophosphate, propiolate, propionate, phenylpropionate, salicylate, sebacate, succinate, suberate, sulfate, bisulfate, pyrosulfate, sulfite, bisulfite, sulfonate, benzene-sulfonate, p-bromophenylsulfonate, chlorobenzenesulfonate, ethanesulfonate, 2-hydroxyethanesulfonate, methanesulfonate, naphthalene-1-sulfonate, naphthalene-2-sulfonate, p-toluenesulfonate, xylenesulfonate, tartarate, and the like. A preferred salt is the hydrochloride salt. The pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts are typically formed by reacting a compound of formula I with an equimolar or excess amount of acid. The reactants are generally combined in a mutual solvent such as diethyl ether or benzene. The salt normally precipitates out of solution within about one hour to 10 days and can be isolated by filtration or the solvent can be stripped off by conventional means. Bases commonly used for formation of salts include ammonium hydroxide and alkali and alkaline earth metal hydroxides, carbonates and bicarbonates, as well as aliphatic and primary, secondary and tertiary amines, aliphatic diamines and hydroxy alkylamines. Bases especially useful in the preparation of addition salts include ammonium hydroxide, potassium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, calcium hydroxide, methylamine, diethylamine, ethylene diamine, cyclohexylamine and ethanolamine. The pharmaceutically acceptable salts generally have enhanced solubility characteristics compared to the compound from which they are derived, and thus are often more amenable to formulation as liquids or emulsions. Pharmaceutical formulations can be prepared by procedures known in the art. For example, the compounds can be formulated with common excipients, diluents, or carriers, and formed into tablets, capsules, suspensions, powders, and the like. Examples of excipients, diluents, and carriers that are suitable for such formulations include the following: fillers and extenders such as starch, sugars, mannitol, and silicic derivatives; binding agents such as carboxymethyl cellulose and other cellulose derivatives, alginates, gelatin, and polyvinyl pyrrolidone; moisturizing agents such as glycerol; disintegrating agents such as calcium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate; agents for retarding dissolution such as paraffin; resorption accelerators such as quaternary ammonium compounds; surface active agents such as cetyl alcohol, glycerol monostearate; adsorptive carriers such as kaolin and bentonite; and lubricants such as talc, calcium and magnesium stearate, and solid polyethyl glycols. The compounds can also be formulated as elixirs or solutions for convenient oral administration or as solutions appropriate for parenteral administration, for instance by intramuscular, subcutaneous or intravenous routes. Additionally, the compounds are well suited to formulation as sustained release dosage forms and the like. The formulations can be so constituted that they release the active ingredient only or preferably in a particular part of the intestinal tract, possibly over a period of time. The coatings, envelopes, and protective matrices may be made, for example, from polymeric substances or waxes. The particular dosage of a compound of formula I required to treat peri-menopausal syndrome, according to this invention will depend upon the severity of the condition, the route of administration, and related factors that will be decided by the attending physician. Generally, accepted and effective daily doses will be from about 0.1 to about 1000 mg/day, and more typically from about 50 to about 600 mg/day. Such dosages will be administered to a subject in need of treatment from once to about three times each day, or more often as needed to effectively treat peri-menopausal syndrome. It is usually preferred to administer a compound of formula I in the form of an acid addition salt, as is customary in the administration of pharmaceuticals bearing a basic group, such as the piperidino ring. It is also advantageous to administer such a compound by the oral route to an aging woman. For such purposes the following oral dosage forms are available.",
    "full_text": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION \n     The terms peri-menopausal refers to that time in a women&#39;s life between pre-menopause (the reproductive years) and post-menopause. This time period is usually between the ages of 40-60, but more often several years on either side of 50 years of age. This period is characterized by a rapid change in the hormonal balance in a woman. Although many different hormones are subject to rapid fluctuation during this time, the most notable are sex related hormones and in particular estrogens and to a lesser extent progestins. The cause of this fluctuation is the natural and time dependent cessation of ovian function. The hallmark of the ending of the peri-menopausal period and the beginning of the post-menopausal period is the cessation of ovian function or its inability to regulate the previously normal ovulation cycle in the woman. This cessation of function is clinically marked by the cessation of mensus of a period of one year or more. The time period ov...",

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The thymus essentially consists of developing thymocytes interspersed within the diverse stromal cells (predominantly-epithelial cell subsets) which constitute the microenvironment and provide the growth factors and cellular interactions necessary for the optimal development of the T cells. The symbiotic developmental relationship between thymocytes and the epithelial subsets that controls their differentiation and maturation (Boyd et al., 1993), means sex-steroid inhibition could occur at the level of either cell type which would then influence the status of the other. It is less likely that there is an inherent defect within the thymocytes themselves since previous studies, utilising radiation chimeras, have shown that BM stem cells are not affected by age (Hirokawa, 1998; Mackall and Gress, 1997) and have a similar degree of thymus repopulation potential as young BM cells. Furthermore, thymocytes in older aged animals retain their ability to differentiate to at least some degree (Mackall and Gress, 1997; George and Ritter, 1996; Hirokawa et al., 1994). However, recent work by Aspinall (1997), has shown a defect within the precursor.

    "abstract": "The present invention generally relates to apparatus, systems and methods for manufacturing food, more specifically semi-moist, shelf-stable meatball products for animal consumption. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A large and growing number of households have pets. Studies have shown that pet owners often treat their pets as they treat close friends and relatives. Owners include pets in holiday celebrations, and often refer to themselves as their pets&#39; parents. Such affinity is tangibly demonstrated in the rapid growth of a multibillion dollar pet industry with an increasing demand for pet products that mimic human products. Health conscious consumers are also demanding higher quality pet food that is not only closer in ingredient quality to human food, but also looks less processed and more natural. However, conventional pet food producers seldom focus on the visual impact of pet food that heightens aesthetic appeal to a purchaser, even if they integrate advanced ingredients more commonly found in food produced for human consumption. People prefer to consume meatballs that are moist, preferably with sauce or gravy. Studies have shown that pets also prefer meatballs with intermediate levels of moisture, but such products are difficult to find on the market. The primary reason is that human grade meat products are usually designed for relatively short shelf lives, whereas pet food is engineered to be stored (if necessary) for eighteen months after manufacturing before it is consumed, and therefore requires a substantially longer shelf life. Human grade meat products, once opened, become stale in less than a week unless refrigerated. Pet treats, however, are expected to last for up to three months after the package is opened, without refrigeration. Moisture content in food is typically correlated with freshness duration and time to spoilage, whereby the higher the moisture content the shorter the shelf life or safe consumption time frame. The delay in the storage and consumption of pet foods requires more careful ingredient selection, preservation of freshness with antioxidants, processing that avoids insects and rancidity, careful packaging and storage. Because high moisture meat products tend to spoil quickly, such products are usually sold in cans in the pet food market, and are more typical as cat food. Pet food or kibble with low moisture content (typically less than 10%), are dry and hard, and less palatable to pets. Semi-moist pet food, typically having moisture content between 15 and 30%, is very popular with animals since it has a texture and palatability that is closest to meat. However, as discussed, semi-moist pet food is difficult to store in a stable condition, without canning or refrigeration, for long periods. In a typical process for manufacturing meatballs for human consumption, frozen meat or poultry is ground with various flavors, flours or seasoning in a batch mixer and then pumped into one end of a meatball former where, on the other end, there is a mechanism that “portions” the meat into smaller parts. An oscillating iris valve has found widespread use as a device that can form spherical meat portions. When meat is pushed through the iris valve, each cycle separates the meat into roughly spherical strips which are then either frozen directly, or cooked and then frozen. The iris valve and other comparable processes used for making human grade meatballs are more suited for batch or semi-continuous operations. They are less amenable to high volume processing which is particularly important for pet food markets because of cost considerations. Meatballs for pet consumption are typically made using scrap portions from human grade meat products, or offal and other byproducts. They are sometimes cooked, refrigerated and freeze dried and sold into the pet food market. However, such freeze-dried meatballs for pet consumption are brittle, crumble easily, contain very little moisture, are generally expensive, and have therefore not been popular with consumers. These freeze-dried “meatballs” also have to be packaged with care because they are not shelf-stable at room temperature. Thus, neither conventional pet food manufacturing processes nor traditional food production techniques used for human consumption can meet the requirements of cost-effectively manufacturing semi-most meatballs products that remain shelf stable for long periods without refrigeration. Furthermore, there is no commercially viable method for producing such meatballs for animal consumption in a continuous manufacturing process, in high volumes, using either fill and form (mold) plates or extrusion techniques. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Illustrative embodiments of the present invention include apparatus, systems and methods for apparatus, systems and methods for manufacturing semi-moist meatballs for animal consumption. Specifically shown herein, as an illustrative embodiment is a method of manufacturing generally spherical pet treats comprising: (a) providing a ground mix of proteinaceous material, flavor enhancers and preservatives to a portioning device that divides said mix into smaller portions of roughly uniform volume, (b) placing said portions on a first belt of a first conveyor moving at a first speed in a longitudinal direction, (c) periodically pressing said portions with a second belt of a second conveyor, where said second belt operates in a plane at a height above, and substantially parallel to, said first belt, said second belt moving at a second speed in substantially the same longitudinal direction as said first belt, while also oscillating back and forth in a lateral direction that is at an angle to said longitudinal direction, such that said portions are transformed into generally spherical shapes. It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the foregoing brief description and the following detailed description are exemplary and explanatory only, and are not intended to be restrictive thereof or limiting the invention. Thus, the accompanying drawings, referred to herein and constituting a part hereof, illustrate only preferred embodiments of the invention, and, together with the detailed description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.",

    "full_text": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION  \n         [0001]    The present invention relates to the administration of an endogenous hormone peptide, more particularly, to the administration of an endogenous hormone peptide with gene-based material to enhance feed efficiency and growth rate of livestock.  \n         BACKGROUND  \n         [0002]    There have been many approaches to stimulate the growth rate of livestock and to enhance feed conversion efficiencies. These include the use of antibiotics, chemicals, and the use of biological compounds such as native or recombinant growth hormones (GH) or growth hormone releasing factors (GHRF. Many of these approaches either have side effects or are too expensive to implement in actual farms or ranches.  \n           [0003]    Although antibiotic supplements have been routinely used to enhance growth performance and feed conversion in the past, their benefits are now diminishing due to improvements in modem farm management and the potential danger of spreading ...",
